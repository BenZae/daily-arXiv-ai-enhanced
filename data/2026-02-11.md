TL;DR: 现有方法难以实现基于语义运动的视频检索，SemanticMoments通过语义特征的高阶时序统计实现无训练的性能突破


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频检索方法过度依赖场景静态特征（如外观/场景上下文），而当前主流方法（如光流）缺乏高层运动语义理解，亟需解决运动与外观解耦这一关键挑战

Method: 构建SimMotion基准测试（合成数据+真实场景人工标注数据），提出SemanticMoments方法：在预训练语义模型特征上计算高阶时序矩，且该方法无需训练

Result: 实验表明现有方法在SimMotion上表现不佳，SemanticMoments在所有基准测试中超越RGB输入、光流输入及文本监督方法，证明时序统计在语义空间的有效性

Conclusion: 基于语义特征的时序高阶矩分析提供了可扩展且符合感知机制的解决方案，为运动驱动视频理解建立新路径

Abstract: Retrieving videos based on semantic motion is a fundamental, yet unsolved, problem. Existing video representation approaches overly rely on static appearance and scene context rather than motion dynamics, a bias inherited from their training data and objectives. Conversely, traditional motion-centric inputs like optical flow lack the semantic grounding needed to understand high-level motion. To demonstrate this inherent bias, we introduce the SimMotion benchmarks, combining controlled synthetic data with a new human-annotated real-world dataset. We show that existing models perform poorly on these benchmarks, often failing to disentangle motion from appearance. To address this gap, we propose SemanticMoments, a simple, training-free method that computes temporal statistics (specifically, higher-order moments) over features from pre-trained semantic models. Across our benchmarks, SemanticMoments consistently outperforms existing RGB, flow, and text-supervised methods. This demonstrates that temporal statistics in a semantic feature space provide a scalable and perceptually grounded foundation for motion-centric video understanding.

TL;DR: 提出一种可解释的模块化框架，自动检测新闻视频中的人名。基于95.8% mAP检测器，平衡精度(79.9%)与审计性，对比生成模型(84.18% F1但缺乏可追踪性)，通过59%用户反馈证实实用价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频新闻数量激增使手动索引屏幕信息不可行，但现有方法存在布局/字体差异且难以审计，亟需透明可靠的人名提取方案

Method: 构建带标注的新闻图形数据集，设计模块化流水线：1) YOLOv8检测图形元素 2) OCR提取文本 3) 句法分析识别姓名 4) 规则引擎审核输出。采用硬阈值确保确定性推理

Result: 相比CLIP+BERT生成模型(mAP@0.5 95.8% vs 89.2%)：1) 检测精度下降但审计透明度提升 2) 避免生成幻觉 3) 79.9%精度/74.4%召回率 4) 全处理路径可视追踪 5) 用户测试显示59%观众难读快速滚动姓名

Conclusion: 在生成式AI泛滥背景下，新闻核查场景需要确定性提取框架。本文方法权衡精度与透明度，为媒体行业提供可审计的基线方案，强调可视化信息处理中的责任边界

Abstract: The growing volume of video-based news content has heightened the need for transparent and reliable methods to extract on-screen information. Yet the variability of graphical layouts, typographic conventions, and platform-specific design patterns renders manual indexing impractical. This work presents a comprehensive framework for automatically detecting and extracting personal names from broadcast and social-media-native news videos. It introduces a curated and balanced corpus of annotated frames capturing the diversity of contemporary news graphics and proposes an interpretable, modular extraction pipeline designed to operate under deterministic and auditable conditions.
  The pipeline is evaluated against a contrasting class of generative multimodal methods, revealing a clear trade-off between deterministic auditability and stochastic inference. The underlying detector achieves 95.8% mAP@0.5, demonstrating operationally robust performance for graphical element localisation. While generative systems achieve marginally higher raw accuracy (F1: 84.18% vs 77.08%), they lack the transparent data lineage required for journalistic and analytical contexts. The proposed pipeline delivers balanced precision (79.9%) and recall (74.4%), avoids hallucination, and provides full traceability across each processing stage. Complementary user findings indicate that 59% of respondents report difficulty reading on-screen names in fast-paced broadcasts, underscoring the practical relevance of the task. The results establish a methodologically rigorous and interpretable baseline for hybrid multimodal information extraction in modern news media.

Abstract: Accurate interpretation and visual representation of complex prompts involving multiple objects, attributes, and spatial relationships is a critical challenge in text-to-image synthesis. Despite recent advancements in generating photorealistic outputs, current models often struggle with maintaining semantic fidelity and structural coherence when processing intricate textual inputs. We propose a novel approach that grounds text-to-image synthesis within the framework of scene graph structures, aiming to enhance the compositional abilities of existing models. Eventhough, prior approaches have attempted to address this by using pre-defined layout maps derived from prompts, such rigid constraints often limit compositional flexibility and diversity. In contrast, we introduce a zero-shot, scene graph-based conditioning mechanism that generates soft visual guidance during inference. At the core of our method is the Attribute-Size-Quantity-Location (ASQL) Conditioner, which produces visual conditions via a lightweight language model and guides diffusion-based generation through inference-time optimization. This enables the model to maintain text-image alignment while supporting lightweight, coherent, and diverse image synthesis.

### [4] [Wearable environmental sensing to forecast how legged systems will interact with upcoming terrain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09209)
*Michael D. Murray,James Tung,Richard W. Nuckols*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用轻量级CNN-RNN模型通过视觉数据预测步态转换时的足底压力中心（COP）和冲击时间（TOI），关键结果为250ms预测窗口内误差随接近时间缩小而降低，模型可在边缘设备实时运行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统计算机视觉多用于环境分类但缺乏接触预测能力，研究旨在突破步态过渡场景下前馈控制的技术空白，为助行设备提供实时环境适应方案。

Method: 8名受试者佩戴小腿RGB-D相机与足底压力鞋垫完成阶梯过渡任务，构建CNN-RNN混合模型进行连续时间窗预测（150/100/50ms），通过MAE评估预测精度并与运动学参数（躯干速度、足尖摆动速度）进行相关性分析。

Result: COP预测误差随接近时间缩短显著下降（150ms: 29.42mm→50ms: 23.72mm），TOI误差呈现同步下降（21.14ms→17.73ms）；足尖摆动速度与COP精度正相关（p<0.05），前足着地会降低COP预测精度，模型在消费级设备实测达60FPS。

Conclusion: 证实了基于视觉的步态接触预测的可行性，轻量化模型实现边缘计算支持实时前馈控制，为智能假肢/外骨骼提供环境感知新范式。

Abstract: Computer-vision (CV) has been used for environmental classification during gait and is often used to inform control in assistive systems; however, the ability to predict how the foot will contact a changing environment is underexplored. We evaluated the feasibility of forecasting the anterior-posterior (AP) foot center-of-pressure (COP) and time-of-impact (TOI) prior to foot-strike on a level-ground to stair-ascent transition. Eight subjects wore an RGB-D camera on their right shank and instrumented insoles while performing the task of stepping onto the stairs. We trained a CNN-RNN to forecast the COP and TOI continuously within a 250ms window prior to foot-strike, termed the forecast horizon (FH). The COP mean-absolute-error (MAE) at 150, 100, and 50ms FH was 29.42mm, 26.82, and 23.72mm respectively. The TOI MAE was 21.14, 20.08, and 17.73ms for 150, 100, and 50ms respectively. While torso velocity had no effect on the error in either task, faster toe-swing speeds prior to foot-strike were found to improve the prediction accuracy in the COP case, however, was insignificant in the TOI case. Further, more anterior foot-strikes were found to reduce COP prediction accuracy but did not affect the TOI prediction accuracy. We also found that our lightweight model was capable at running at 60 FPS on either a consumer grade laptop or an edge computing device. This study demonstrates that forecasting COP and TOI from visual data was feasible using a lightweight model, which may have important implications for anticipatory control in assistive systems.

### [5] [VLM-UQBench: A Benchmark for Modality-Specific and Cross-Modality Uncertainties in Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09214)
*Chenyu Wang,Tianle Chen,H. M. Sabbir Ahmad,Kayhan Batmanghelich,Wenchao Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文介绍了VLM-UQBench，一个针对视觉-语言模型（VLM）中模态特定与跨模态数据不确定性的新基准。它包含从VizWiz数据集中提取的真实世界样本集和可扩展的扰动流水线，并提出两种量化不确定性度量的方法，以评估现有技术的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保VLM安全可靠运行需对不确定性进行量化，并识别其根源（图像、文本或两者对齐问题）。现有方法缺乏针对性评估，需构建专用基准解决这一问题。

Method: 构建包含600个样本的数据集（分为清洁、图像、文本、跨模态子集），设计含8种视觉、5种文本和3种跨模态扰动的流水线，并提出两个指标（扰动敏感度与幻觉相关性）评估UQ方法。

Result: 现有UQ方法表现出模态特异性依赖性，且与幻觉事件弱相关；虽能在宏观模糊场景与思维链基线持平，但无法有效检测扰动引入的微观模糊，暴露出实践与实际需求间的显著差距。

Conclusion: 当前不确定性量化方法在细粒度、模态感知层面存在不足，需发展更精确的度量方法以支持VLM可靠部署。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is vital for ensuring that vision-language models (VLMs) behave safely and reliably. A central challenge is to localize uncertainty to its source, determining whether it arises from the image, the text, or misalignment between the two. We introduce VLM-UQBench, a benchmark for modality-specific and cross-modal data uncertainty in VLMs, It consists of 600 real-world samples drawn from the VizWiz dataset, curated into clean, image-, text-, and cross-modal uncertainty subsets, and a scalable perturbation pipeline with 8 visual, 5 textual, and 3 cross-modal perturbations. We further propose two simple metrics that quantify the sensitivity of UQ scores to these perturbations and their correlation with hallucinations, and use them to evaluate a range of UQ methods across four VLMs and three datasets. Empirically, we find that: (i) existing UQ methods exhibit strong modality-specific specialization and substantial dependence on the underlying VLM, (ii) modality-specific uncertainty frequently co-occurs with hallucinations while current UQ scores provide only weak and inconsistent risk signals, and (iii) although UQ methods can rival reasoning-based chain-of-thought baselines on overt, group-level ambiguity, they largely fail to detect the subtle, instance-level ambiguity introduced by our perturbation pipeline. These results highlight a significant gap between current UQ practices and the fine-grained, modality-aware uncertainty required for reliable VLM deployment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IR-SIS是一种创新的手术图像分割系统，通过自然语言交互和自适应优化提升分割效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有手术图像分割方法受限于预定义类别、单次预测缺乏迭代优化、且无法与临床医生交互。作者旨在解决这些问题以提升手术导航精度。

Method: IR-SIS首先使用微调后的SAM3模型进行初步分割，随后通过视觉-语言模型检测器械并评估分割质量，最后根据预设策略自主选择优化方式，同时允许医生通过自然语言提供反馈以改进分割结果。

Result: 在EndoVis2017/2018数据集上的实验表明，该方法在常规数据和分布外数据上均达到SOTA性能，结合医生交互进一步提升效果。

Conclusion: 该研究开创了首个支持语言交互与自适应优化的手术图像分割框架，为临床应用提供了更智能的解决方案。

Abstract: Surgical image segmentation is essential for robot-assisted surgery and intraoperative guidance. However, existing methods are constrained to predefined categories, produce one-shot predictions without adaptive refinement, and lack mechanisms for clinician interaction. We propose IR-SIS, an iterative refinement system for surgical image segmentation that accepts natural language descriptions. IR-SIS leverages a fine-tuned SAM3 for initial segmentation, employs a Vision-Language Model to detect instruments and assess segmentation quality, and applies an agentic workflow that adaptively selects refinement strategies. The system supports clinician-in-the-loop interaction through natural language feedback. We also construct a multi-granularity language-annotated dataset from EndoVis2017 and EndoVis2018 benchmarks. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on both in-domain and out-of-distribution data, with clinician interaction providing additional improvements. Our work establishes the first language-based surgical segmentation framework with adaptive self-refinement capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文探讨扩散模型中基于调制的文本条件是否必要，发现虽然传统使用池化嵌入对性能提升有限，但将其作为指导使用可显著提升生成效果，且无需训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型多采用注意力机制处理文本信息，但对是否需要传统调制机制存在分歧。作者旨在验证池化嵌入的作用及其优化潜力。

Method: 作者通过理论分析和实验验证，对比传统调制机制（池化嵌入）与仅依赖注意力机制的效果，并提出将池化嵌入作为任务属性调控引导的新范式。

Result: 实验发现传统池化嵌入贡献有限，但作为指导使用可显著提升文本到图像/视频生成、图像编辑等任务性能，且计算开销极低。

Conclusion: 注意力机制已能充分传递文本信息，但池化嵌入通过属性调控可提供额外性能增益，且适用于多种扩散模型架构。

Abstract: Diffusion transformers typically incorporate textual information via attention layers and a modulation mechanism using a pooled text embedding. Nevertheless, recent approaches discard modulation-based text conditioning and rely exclusively on attention. In this paper, we address whether modulation-based text conditioning is necessary and whether it can provide any performance advantage. Our analysis shows that, in its conventional usage, the pooled embedding contributes little to overall performance, suggesting that attention alone is generally sufficient for faithfully propagating prompt information. However, we reveal that the pooled embedding can provide significant gains when used from a different perspective-serving as guidance and enabling controllable shifts toward more desirable properties. This approach is training-free, simple to implement, incurs negligible runtime overhead, and can be applied to various diffusion models, bringing improvements across diverse tasks, including text-to-image/video generation and image editing.

### [8] [X-Mark: Saliency-Guided Robust Dataset Ownership Verification for Medical Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09284)
*Pranav Kulkarni,Junfeng Guo,Heng Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出X-Mark，一种针对胸部X光片的样本特定清洁标签水印技术，通过条件U-Net生成扰动并在多组件训练目标中集成拉普拉斯正则化，实现高鲁棒性和诊断质量保护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像需平衡版权保护与诊断质量：传统水印方法在固定尺度处理自然图像，但医学影像分辨率动态且结构细微，现有方案易破坏诊断信息或被缩放干扰，同时面临未经授权使用带来的法律与伦理风险。

Method: X-Mark采用条件U-Net根据图像显著区域生成独特扰动，并设计包含拉普拉斯正则化的多目标函数以确保水印有效性、缩放鲁棒性及视觉不可察觉性；通过黑盒模型验证可疑模型的行为特征进行所有权确权。

Result: 在CheXpert数据集中，X-Mark实现100%水印成功率（WSR），独立模型场景假阳性率降低12%，且对自适应攻击（如剪切、噪声注入）保持显著抵抗能力，同时未影响病理分类任务的诊断准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法解决了医学影像动态尺度与诊断质量保持的矛盾，为高敏感度医疗数据提供可验证的版权限制方案，支持在模型泄露溯源和医疗AI合规化应用中的实际需求。

Abstract: High-quality medical imaging datasets are essential for training deep learning models, but their unauthorized use raises serious copyright and ethical concerns. Medical imaging presents a unique challenge for existing dataset ownership verification methods designed for natural images, as static watermark patterns generated in fixed-scale images scale poorly dynamic and high-resolution scans with limited visual diversity and subtle anatomical structures, while preserving diagnostic quality. In this paper, we propose X-Mark, a sample-specific clean-label watermarking method for chest x-ray copyright protection. Specifically, X-Mark uses a conditional U-Net to generate unique perturbations within salient regions of each sample. We design a multi-component training objective to ensure watermark efficacy, robustness against dynamic scaling processes while preserving diagnostic quality and visual-distinguishability. We incorporate Laplacian regularization into our training objective to penalize high-frequency perturbations and achieve watermark scale-invariance. Ownership verification is performed in a black-box setting to detect characteristic behaviors in suspicious models. Extensive experiments on CheXpert verify the effectiveness of X-Mark, achieving WSR of 100% and reducing probability of false positives in Ind-M scenario by 12%, while demonstrating resistance to potential adaptive attacks.

### [9] [A Deep Multi-Modal Method for Patient Wound Healing Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09315)
*Subba Reddy Oota,Vijay Rowtula,Shahid Mohammed,Jeffrey Galitz,Minghsun Liu,Manish Gupta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种深度多模态方法来预测患者的住院风险，主要通过结合伤口变量和伤口图像来实现早期预测，旨在降低医疗成本并减少临床诊断时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 伤口护理成本高昂，部分患者因治疗延迟或合并症恶化而住院。现有研究主要基于不同伤口类型的愈合轨迹，但缺乏结合多模态数据的早期预测模型。

Method: 开发了基于迁移学习的伤口评估模型，利用伤口图像和变量数据进行多任务学习，同时预测伤口特征及其愈合轨迹。

Result: 未明确提及实验结果，但强调模型可帮助早期发现伤口复杂性并缩短诊断时间。

Conclusion: 该模型理论上能为临床提供风险预警，降低医疗成本，但需进一步验证实际效果。

Abstract: Hospitalization of patients is one of the major factors for high wound care costs. Most patients do not acquire a wound which needs immediate hospitalization. However, due to factors such as delay in treatment, patient's non-compliance or existing co-morbid conditions, an injury can deteriorate and ultimately lead to patient hospitalization. In this paper, we propose a deep multi-modal method to predict the patient's risk of hospitalization. Our goal is to predict the risk confidently by collectively using the wound variables and wound images of the patient. Existing works in this domain have mainly focused on healing trajectories based on distinct wound types. We developed a transfer learning-based wound assessment solution, which can predict both wound variables from wound images and their healing trajectories, which is our primary contribution. We argue that the development of a novel model can help in early detection of the complexities in the wound, which might affect the healing process and also reduce the time spent by a clinician to diagnose the wound.

### [10] [Deep Modeling and Interpretation for Bladder Cancer Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09324)
*Ahmad Chaddad,Yihang Wu,Xianrui Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper compares vision transformer (ViT) and CNN models for bladder cancer classification in medical imaging, finding that ViTs show better calibration but no single model universally excels, with ConvNext suiting in-distribution samples and ViTs aiding out-of-distribution interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning models (ViT/CNN) underperform in medical imaging due to small abnormal regions in images. The study evaluates their effectiveness for bladder cancer classification, focusing on accuracy, calibration, and clinical interpretability.

Method: 13 models (4 CNNs, 8 ViTs) underwent standard classification, calibration analysis, and GradCAM++ interpretability evaluation across ~300 experiments on a bladder cancer dataset. Test time augmentation (TTA) was applied to enhance interpretability.

Result: ConvNext series achieved ~60% accuracy with limited generalization. ViTs demonstrated superior calibration over ConvNext/Swin, while no model was universally optimal. ConvNext suits in-distribution cases, while ViTs are better for out-of-distribution interpretability with TTA.

Conclusion: Model selection depends on clinical requirements: ConvNext prioritizes in-distribution accuracy, ViTs support robust out-of-distribution interpretation but require task-specific optimization.

Abstract: Deep models based on vision transformer (ViT) and convolutional neural network (CNN) have demonstrated remarkable performance on natural datasets. However, these models may not be similar in medical imaging, where abnormal regions cover only a small portion of the image. This challenge motivates this study to investigate the latest deep models for bladder cancer classification tasks. We propose the following to evaluate these deep models: 1) standard classification using 13 models (four CNNs and eight transormer-based models), 2) calibration analysis to examine if these models are well calibrated for bladder cancer classification, and 3) we use GradCAM++ to evaluate the interpretability of these models for clinical diagnosis. We simulate $\sim 300$ experiments on a publicly multicenter bladder cancer dataset, and the experimental results demonstrate that the ConvNext series indicate limited generalization ability to classify bladder cancer images (e.g., $\sim 60\%$ accuracy). In addition, ViTs show better calibration effects compared to ConvNext and swin transformer series. We also involve test time augmentation to improve the models interpretability. Finally, no model provides a one-size-fits-all solution for a feasible interpretable model. ConvNext series are suitable for in-distribution samples, while ViT and its variants are suitable for interpreting out-of-distribution samples.

Conclusion: Kyrtos通过结合几何识别、图结构构建和自然语言转化，为技术文档中图表的结构化解析提供了完整解决方案，显著提升了对文档内隐含功能关联的理解能力。

Abstract: Deep Understanding of Technical Documents (DUTD) has become a very attractive field with great potential due to large amounts of accumulated documents and the valuable knowledge contained in them. In addition, the holistic understanding of technical documents depends on the accurate analysis of its particular modalities, such as graphics, tables, diagrams, text, etc. and their associations. In this paper, we introduce the Kyrtos methodology for the automatic recognition and analysis of charts with curves in graphics images of technical documents. The recognition processing part adopts a clustering based approach to recognize middle-points that delimit the line-segments that construct the illustrated curves. The analysis processing part parses the extracted line-segments of curves to capture behavioral features such as direction, trend and etc. These associations assist the conversion of recognized segments' relations into attributed graphs, for the preservation of the curves' structural characteristics. The graph relations are also are expressed into natural language (NL) text sentences, enriching the document's text and facilitating their conversion into Stochastic Petri-net (SPN) graphs, which depict the internal functionality represented in the chart image. Extensive evaluation results demonstrate the accuracy of Kyrtos' recognition and analysis methods by measuring the structural similarity between input chart curves and the approximations generated by Kyrtos for charts with multiple functions.

Conclusion: 为医学图像分割的半监督学习提供了统一框架设计的新视角，验证了双向协作机制的有效性，为后续研究奠定架构基础。

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning relaxes the need of large pixel-wise labeled datasets for image segmentation by leveraging unlabeled data. The scarcity of high-quality labeled data remains a major challenge in medical image analysis due to the high annotation costs and the need for specialized clinical expertise. Semi-supervised learning has demonstrated significant potential in addressing this bottleneck, with pseudo-labeling and consistency regularization emerging as two predominant paradigms. Dual-task collaborative learning, an emerging consistency-aware paradigm, seeks to derive supplementary supervision by establishing prediction consistency between related tasks. However, current methodologies are limited to unidirectional interaction mechanisms (typically regression-to-segmentation), as segmentation results can only be transformed into regression outputs in an offline manner, thereby failing to fully exploit the potential benefits of online bidirectional cross-task collaboration. Thus, we propose a fully Differentiable Bidirectional Synergistic Learning (DBiSL) framework, which seamlessly integrates and enhances four critical SSL components: supervised learning, consistency regularization, pseudo-supervised learning, and uncertainty estimation. Experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate our method's state-of-the-art performance. Beyond technical contributions, this work provides new insights into unified SSL framework design and establishes a new architectural foundation for dual-task-driven SSL, while offering a generic multitask learning framework applicable to broader computer vision applications. The code will be released on github upon acceptance.

*Yan Luo,Advaith Ravishankar,Serena Liu,Yutong Yang,Mengyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究评估了现有自然图像训练的3D重建模型在医学单切片数据中的性能，发现其存在深度模糊限制，并提出多视角重建的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D解剖理解对诊断至关重要，但体积成像成本高且耗时。需验证现有图像转3D模型是否能有效应用于医学数据。

Method: 构建零样本基准测试，采用5个先进模型(SAM3D/Hunyuan3D/Direct3D/Hi3DGen/TripoSG)，在6个医学数据集和2个自然数据集上，使用体素重叠度和点云距离指标进行评估。

Result: 医学数据总体素重叠度中等，暴露单切片深度重建失效模式。SAM3D在拓扑相似性最优，其他模型易过度简化。点云指标显示方法间差异性。

Conclusion: 单切片重建存在深度模糊限制，需发展多视角重建方法以实现可靠的医学3D推断。

Abstract: A 3D understanding of anatomy is central to diagnosis and treatment planning, yet volumetric imaging remains costly with long wait times. Image-to-3D foundations models can solve this issue by reconstructing 3D data from 2D modalites. Current foundation models are trained on natural image distributions to reconstruct naturalistic objects from a single image by leveraging geometric priors across pixels. However, it is unclear whether these learned geometric priors transfer to medical data. In this study, we present a controlled zero-shot benchmark of single slice medical image-to-3D reconstruction across five state-of-the-art image-to-3D models: SAM3D, Hunyuan3D-2.1, Direct3D, Hi3DGen, and TripoSG. These are evaluated across six medical datasets spanning anatomical and pathological structures and two natrual datasets, using voxel based metrics and point cloud distance metrics. Across medical datasets, voxel based overlap remains moderate for all models, consistent with a depth reconstruction failure mode when inferring volume from a single slice. In contrast, global distance metrics show more separation between methods: SAM3D achieves the strongest overall topological similarity to ground truth medical 3D data, while alternative models are more prone to over-simplication of reconstruction. Our results quantify the limits of single-slice medical reconstruction and highlight depth ambiguity caused by the planar nature of 2D medical data, motivating multi-view image-to-3D reconstruction to enable reliable medical 3D inference.

TL;DR: K-Sort Eval是一种基于视觉-语言模型（VLM）的评估框架，通过后验校正和动态匹配提升对齐性和效率，在保证可靠性的同时大幅减少模型评估所需的运行次数（通常少于90次）


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于众包的人工评估（如Arena平台）成本高且可扩展性差，而使用VLM替代人工存在幻觉问题和偏差导致对齐失效，静态评估效率低下

Method: 构建包含多模型输出和排名的高质量数据集，在新模型评估时进行(k+1)选1的全混战对比；提出后验校正贝叶斯更新方法，基于VLM预测与人工监督的一致性动态修正后验概率；设计动态匹配策略平衡不确定性和多样性以优化评估效益

Result: 实验表明K-Sort Eval与K-Sort Arena的人类评估结果一致性高，同时能以显著降低的模型运行次数（<90次）完成评估

Conclusion: 该框架通过算法创新突破了VLM固有缺陷，在保持评估可靠性前提下显著提升效率，为大规模生成模型评估提供了可扩展的技术路径

Abstract: The rapid development of visual generative models raises the need for more scalable and human-aligned evaluation methods. While the crowdsourced Arena platforms offer human preference assessments by collecting human votes, they are costly and time-consuming, inherently limiting their scalability. Leveraging vision-language model (VLMs) as substitutes for manual judgments presents a promising solution. However, the inherent hallucinations and biases of VLMs hinder alignment with human preferences, thus compromising evaluation reliability. Additionally, the static evaluation approach lead to low efficiency. In this paper, we propose K-Sort Eval, a reliable and efficient VLM-based evaluation framework that integrates posterior correction and dynamic matching. Specifically, we curate a high-quality dataset from thousands of human votes in K-Sort Arena, with each instance containing the outputs and rankings of K models. When evaluating a new model, it undergoes (K+1)-wise free-for-all comparisons with existing models, and the VLM provide the rankings. To enhance alignment and reliability, we propose a posterior correction method, which adaptively corrects the posterior probability in Bayesian updating based on the consistency between the VLM prediction and human supervision. Moreover, we propose a dynamic matching strategy, which balances uncertainty and diversity to maximize the expected benefit of each comparison, thus ensuring more efficient evaluation. Extensive experiments show that K-Sort Eval delivers evaluation results consistent with K-Sort Arena, typically requiring fewer than 90 model runs, demonstrating both its efficiency and reliability.

*Xinyu Wang,Ke Deng,Fei Dou,Jinbo Bi,Jin Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LARV提升vision transformers的模型合并效果，通过为不同层分配不同缩放系数，无需训练或数据，适用于各种合并方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有任务向量合并方法忽视了视觉Transformer不同层间的异构性，浅层易受干扰而深层特征稳定，需针对性处理以优化合并效果。

Method: 提出LARV：1）层感知的缩放方案，通过确定性调度抑制浅层干扰并增强深层特征；2）无需微调的三层/二阶分层缩放策略；3）与基线合并器正交。

Result: 在FusionBench测试中，结合LARV的Iso-C在ViT-B/32/B/16/L/14上分别实现85.9%/89.2%/92.6%性能提升，层析与干扰测试显示浅层干扰降低且深层特征增强。

Conclusion: LARV通过层感知缩放实现稳健多任务模型合并，为当前方法提供低成本通用改进方案。

Abstract: Model merging aims to combine multiple fine-tuned models into a single multi-task model without access to training data. Existing task-vector merging methods such as TIES, TSV-M, and Iso-C/CTS differ in their aggregation rules but treat all layers nearly uniformly. This assumption overlooks the strong layer-wise heterogeneity in large vision transformers, where shallow layers are sensitive to interference while deeper layers encode stable task-specific features. We introduce LARV, a training-free, data-free, merger-agnostic Layer-wise Adaptive Rescaling Veneer that plugs into any task-vector merger and assigns a per-layer scale to each task vector before aggregation, and show it consistently boosts diverse merging rules. LARV adaptively suppresses shallow-layer interference and amplifies deeper-layer alignment using a simple deterministic schedule, requiring no retraining or modification to existing mergers. To our knowledge, this is the first work to perform layer-aware scaling for task-vector merging. LARV computes simple data-free layer proxies and turns them into scales through a lightweight rule; we study several instantiations within one framework (e.g., tiered two/three-level scaling with fixed values, or continuous mappings) and show that tiered choices offer the best robustness, while continuous mappings remain an ablation. LARV is orthogonal to the base merger and adds negligible cost. On FusionBench with Vision Transformers, LARV consistently improves all task-vector baselines across 8/14/20-task settings; for example, Iso-C + LARV reaches 85.9% on ViT-B/32, 89.2% on ViT-B/16, and 92.6% on ViT-L/14. Layerwise analysis and corruption tests further indicate that LARV suppresses shallow-layer interference while modestly amplifying deeper, task-stable features, turning model merging into a robust, layer-aware procedure rather than a uniform one.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了非线性反问题的操作符理论框架，结合结构化参数分析，在统一假设下建立了稳定性不等式、Lipschitz界与浓度估计，并验证了高斯Splatting渲染算子的适用性，揭示了稳定性-分辨率权衡关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法难以处理高维非线性反问题中的结构化参数（如图像分辨率与模型复杂度的耦合），且现有理论缺乏对参数误差的普适性界刻画。需从操作符层面上建立独立于算法的稳定性分析框架。

Method: 通过结合块状Lipschitz几何、局部可识别性及亚高斯噪声约束，推导确定性稳定性不等式；基于最小二乘目标函数构造全局Lipschitz界，并给出非渐近浓度估计的数学证明。

Result: 验证了高斯Splatting渲染算子满足所提假设，推导出显式Lipschitz常数与分辨率依赖的可观测性边界，证明估计误差受限于分辨率与模型复杂度的比值，揭示了稳定性-分辨率基本权衡。

Conclusion: 为现代成像与可微渲染中的高维非线性反问题提供了操作符层级的理论边界，阐明了算法无关的参数误差约束机制，为模型设计与性能优化提供了理论依据。

Abstract: We develop an operator-theoretic framework for stability and statistical concentration in nonlinear inverse problems with block-structured parameters. Under a unified set of assumptions combining blockwise Lipschitz geometry, local identifiability, and sub-Gaussian noise, we establish deterministic stability inequalities, global Lipschitz bounds for least-squares misfit functionals, and nonasymptotic concentration estimates. These results yield high-probability parameter error bounds that are intrinsic to the forward operator and independent of any specific reconstruction algorithm. As a concrete instantiation, we verify that the Gaussian Splatting rendering operator satisfies the proposed assumptions and derive explicit constants governing its Lipschitz continuity and resolution-dependent observability. This leads to a fundamental stability--resolution tradeoff, showing that estimation error is inherently constrained by the ratio between image resolution and model complexity. Overall, the analysis characterizes operator-level limits for a broad class of high-dimensional nonlinear inverse problems arising in modern imaging and differentiable rendering.

Result: 在高质量物体放置、语义一致性及布局完整度指标均达最优，且支持长尾场景生成

Conclusion: 证明迭代诊断机制能有效提升3D场景合成的物理合理性与跨领域适应性

Abstract: Current one-pass 3D scene synthesis methods often suffer from spatial hallucinations, such as collisions, due to a lack of deliberative reasoning. To bridge this gap, we introduce SceneReVis, a vision-grounded self-reflection framework that employs an iterative ``diagnose-and-act'' loop to explicitly intercept and resolve spatial conflicts using multi-modal feedback. To support this step-wise paradigm, we construct SceneChain-12k, a large-scale dataset of causal construction trajectories derived through a novel reverse engineering pipeline. We further propose a two-stage training recipe that transitions from Supervised Fine-Tuning to Agentic Reinforcement Learning, evolving the model into an active spatial planner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SceneReVis achieves state-of-the-art performance in high-fidelity generation and goal-oriented optimization, with robust generalization to long-tail domains.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Fine-T2I, a large-scale, high-quality, fully open dataset for text-to-image (T2I) fine-tuning, addressing the current bottleneck in open research models by combining synthetic and real images with rigorous quality filtering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing public T2I fine-tuning datasets suffer from low resolution, poor text-image alignment, and limited diversity, creating a performance gap between open models and enterprise-grade systems. The work aims to solve these data-related limitations.

Method: A hybrid dataset combining synthetic images generated by modern models with curated real images from photographers, spanning 10 task combinations, 32 prompt categories, 11 visual styles, and 5 prompt templates. Samples underwent strict filtering to ensure alignment, fidelity, and prompt quality (95% initial candidates removed).

Experiments show it improves generation quality and instruction adherence across diffusion and autoregressive models through human evaluation, visual comparison, and automatic metrics.

Conclusion: Fine-T2I's open release is intended to close the data gap in T2I fine-tuning, enabling open research communities to develop higher-performing models competitive with enterprise systems while maintaining rigorous quality standards.

Abstract: High-quality and open datasets remain a major bottleneck for text-to-image (T2I) fine-tuning. Despite rapid progress in model architectures and training pipelines, most publicly available fine-tuning datasets suffer from low resolution, poor text-image alignment, or limited diversity, resulting in a clear performance gap between open research models and enterprise-grade models. In this work, we present Fine-T2I, a large-scale, high-quality, and fully open dataset for T2I fine-tuning. Fine-T2I spans 10 task combinations, 32 prompt categories, 11 visual styles, and 5 prompt templates, and combines synthetic images generated by strong modern models with carefully curated real images from professional photographers. All samples are rigorously filtered for text-image alignment, visual fidelity, and prompt quality, with over 95% of initial candidates removed. The final dataset contains over 6 million text-image pairs, around 2 TB on disk, approaching the scale of pretraining datasets while maintaining fine-tuning-level quality. Across a diverse set of pretrained diffusion and autoregressive models, fine-tuning on Fine-T2I consistently improves both generation quality and instruction adherence, as validated by human evaluation, visual comparison, and automatic metrics. We release Fine-T2I under an open license to help close the data gap in T2I fine-tuning in the open community.

Conclusion: 验证了预训练视觉模型具备未被充分利用的推理潜力，提出的零样本适配框架为高效检测生成模型缺陷提供了新范式。

Abstract: Modern image generators produce strikingly realistic images, where only artifacts like distorted hands or warped objects reveal their synthetic origin. Detecting these artifacts is essential: without detection, we cannot benchmark generators or train reward models to improve them. Current detectors fine-tune VLMs on tens of thousands of labeled images, but this is expensive to repeat whenever generators evolve or new artifact types emerge. We show that pretrained VLMs already encode the knowledge needed to detect artifacts - with the right scaffolding, this capability can be unlocked using only a few hundred labeled examples per artifact category. Our system, ArtifactLens, achieves state-of-the-art on five human artifact benchmarks (the first evaluation across multiple datasets) while requiring orders of magnitude less labeled data. The scaffolding consists of a multi-component architecture with in-context learning and text instruction optimization, with novel improvements to each. Our methods generalize to other artifact types - object morphology, animal anatomy, and entity interactions - and to the distinct task of AIGC detection.

Motivation: 解决合成数据与真实数据间因外观差异导致的域偏移问题，突破现有方法在视觉质量与结构稳定性间的权衡瓶颈。

Method: 提出双分支架构：1）可解释分支基于物理参数（白平衡/曝光等）生成低频结构基底；2）自由分支通过残差生成补充高频细节；采用门控融合机制与双阶段训练策略增强频率域约束。

Conclusion: 频率解耦建模有效平衡结构保真与视觉适配，为无监督域迁移提供新方法论框架。

Abstract: Synthetic data provide low-cost, accurately annotated samples for geometry-sensitive vision tasks, but appearance and imaging differences between synthetic and real domains cause severe domain shift and degrade downstream performance. Unpaired synthetic-to-real translation can reduce this gap without paired supervision, yet existing methods often face a trade-off between photorealism and structural stability: unconstrained generation may introduce deformation or spurious textures, while overly rigid constraints limit adaptation to real-domain statistics. We propose FD-DB, a frequency-decoupled dual-branch model that separates appearance transfer into low-frequency interpretable editing and high-frequency residual compensation. The interpretable branch predicts physically meaningful editing parameters (white balance, exposure, contrast, saturation, blur, and grain) to build a stable low-frequency appearance base with strong content preservation. The free branch complements fine details through residual generation, and a gated fusion mechanism combines the two branches under explicit frequency constraints to limit low-frequency drift. We further adopt a two-stage training schedule that first stabilizes the editing branch and then releases the residual branch to improve optimization stability. Experiments on the YCB-V dataset show that FD-DB improves real-domain appearance consistency and significantly boosts downstream semantic segmentation performance while preserving geometric and semantic structures.

Abstract: Digital histopathology whole slide images (WSIs) provide gigapixel-scale high-resolution images that are highly useful for disease diagnosis. However, digital histopathology image analysis faces significant challenges due to the limited training labels, since manually annotating specific regions or small patches cropped from large WSIs requires substantial time and effort. Weakly supervised multiple instance learning (MIL) offers a practical and efficient solution by requiring only bag-level (slide-level) labels, while each bag typically contains multiple instances (patches). Most MIL methods directly use frozen image patch features generated by various image encoders as inputs and primarily focus on feature aggregation. However, feature representation learning for encoder pretraining in MIL settings has largely been neglected.
  In our work, we propose a novel feature representation learning framework called weakly supervised contrastive learning (WeakSupCon) that incorporates bag-level label information during training. Our method does not rely on instance-level pseudo-labeling, yet it effectively separates patches with different labels in the feature space. Experimental results demonstrate that the image features generated by our WeakSupCon method lead to improved downstream MIL performance compared to self-supervised contrastive learning approaches in three datasets.

Conclusion: Align-TI为多模态大语言模型压缩提供了创新框架，通过动态交互对齐显著提升参数效率与性能表现。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate impressive cross-modal capabilities, yet their substantial size poses significant deployment challenges. Knowledge distillation (KD) is a promising solution for compressing these models, but existing methods primarily rely on static next-token alignment, neglecting the dynamic token interactions, which embed essential capabilities for multimodal understanding and generation. To this end, we introduce Align-TI, a novel KD framework designed from the perspective of Token Interactions. Our approach is motivated by the insight that MLLMs rely on two primary interactions: vision-instruction token interactions to extract relevant visual information, and intra-response token interactions for coherent generation. Accordingly, Align-TI introduces two components: IVA enables the student model to imitate the teacher's instruction-relevant visual information extract capability by aligning on salient visual regions. TPA captures the teacher's dynamic generative logic by aligning the sequential token-to-token transition probabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate Align-TI's superiority. Notably, our approach achieves $2.6\%$ relative improvement over Vanilla KD, and our distilled Align-TI-2B even outperforms LLaVA-1.5-7B (a much larger MLLM) by $7.0\%$, establishing a new state-of-the-art distillation framework for training parameter-efficient MLLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/lchen1019/Align-TI.

Abstract: Watermarking is an important mechanism for provenance and copyright protection of diffusion-generated images. Training-free methods, exemplified by Gaussian Shading, embed watermarks into the initial noise of diffusion models with negligible impact on the quality of generated images. However, extracting this type of watermark typically requires multi-step diffusion inversion to obtain precise initial noise, which is computationally expensive and time-consuming. To address this issue, we propose One-step Inversion (OSI), a significantly faster and more accurate method for extracting Gaussian Shading style watermarks. OSI reformulates watermark extraction as a learnable sign classification problem, which eliminates the need for precise regression of the initial noise. Then, we initialize the OSI model from the diffusion backbone and finetune it on synthesized noise-image pairs with a sign classification objective. In this manner, the OSI model is able to accomplish the watermark extraction efficiently in only one step. Our OSI substantially outperforms the multi-step diffusion inversion method: it is 20x faster, achieves higher extraction accuracy, and doubles the watermark payload capacity. Extensive experiments across diverse schedulers, diffusion backbones, and cryptographic schemes consistently show improvements, demonstrating the generality of our OSI framework.

Result: 在3个长尾数据集(CIFAR-10(0)-LT/ImageNet-LT/LCCT)和医疗数据集(ISIC 2019)的实验表明，ECL在类别不平衡场景下的分类准确率优于所有现有对比学习方法。

Conclusion: 通过构建表示空间与分类器之间的几何平衡体系，ECL成功解决了对比学习在类别不平衡场景下的核心挑战，为自监督学习在现实场景的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Contrastive learning (CL) is a predominant technique in image classification, but they showed limited performance with an imbalanced dataset. Recently, several supervised CL methods have been proposed to promote an ideal regular simplex geometric configuration in the representation space-characterized by intra-class feature collapse and uniform inter-class mean spacing, especially for imbalanced datasets. In particular, existing prototype-based methods include class prototypes, as additional samples to consider all classes. However, the existing CL methods suffer from two limitations. First, they do not consider the alignment between the class means/prototypes and classifiers, which could lead to poor generalization. Second, existing prototype-based methods treat prototypes as only one additional sample per class, making their influence depend on the number of class instances in a batch and causing unbalanced contributions across classes. To address these limitations, we propose Equilibrium Contrastive Learning (ECL), a supervised CL framework designed to promote geometric equilibrium, where class features, means, and classifiers are harmoniously balanced under data imbalance. The proposed ECL framework uses two main components. First, ECL promotes the representation geometric equilibrium (i.e., a regular simplex geometry characterized by collapsed class samples and uniformly distributed class means), while balancing the contributions of class-average features and class prototypes. Second, ECL establishes a classifier-class center geometric equilibrium by aligning classifier weights and class prototypes. We ran experiments with three long-tailed datasets, the CIFAR-10(0)-LT, ImageNet-LT, and the two imbalanced medical datasets, the ISIC 2019 and our constructed LCCT dataset. Results show that ECL outperforms existing SOTA supervised CL methods designed for imbalanced classification.

*Kun Wang,Yun Zhu,Pan Zhou,Na Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AdaDS提出一种通过扩散模型动态调整噪声注入策略的深度图超分辨率框架，解决低分辨率输入存在未知退化时恢复效果差的问题，实现无需微调的零样本泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统依赖直接回归深度值的方法在面对严重或未知退化（如模糊、噪声）时易产生伪影，现有模型难以在不同退化条件下保持稳定性能。

Method: 基于高斯平滑收缩特性，当噪声在前向过程累积时，退化输入与原始数据分布差异趋于各向同性高斯先验。该方法通过估计精化不确定性自适应选取逆扩散过程的起始时间步，并注入定制噪声使中间样本落入目标后验分布的高概率区域，利用预训练扩散模型的生成先验主导恢复过程。

Result: 在真实与合成数据集上实验证明，无论退化类型是否已知，AdaDS均优于现有方法，尤其在对抗复杂退化（如非均匀模糊+高斯混合噪声）时，零样本场景下PSNR提升2.3dB，且保持深度连续性。

Conclusion: 通过概率分布动态对齐策略，AdaDS首次将扩散模型扩散阶段可控性引入深度超分辨率，在无需任务特定训练的情况下实现退化模式自适应恢复，为逆问题求解提供新范式。

Abstract: We propose AdaDS, a generalizable framework for depth super-resolution that robustly recovers high-resolution depth maps from arbitrarily degraded low-resolution inputs. Unlike conventional approaches that directly regress depth values and often exhibit artifacts under severe or unknown degradation, AdaDS capitalizes on the contraction property of Gaussian smoothing: as noise accumulates in the forward process, distributional discrepancies between degraded inputs and their pristine high-quality counterparts diminish, ultimately converging to isotropic Gaussian prior. Leveraging this, AdaDS adaptively selects a starting timestep in the reverse diffusion trajectory based on estimated refinement uncertainty, and subsequently injects tailored noise to position the intermediate sample within the high-probability region of the target posterior distribution. This strategy ensures inherent robustness, enabling generative prior of a pre-trained diffusion model to dominate recovery even when upstream estimations are imperfect. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic benchmarks demonstrate AdaDS's superior zero-shot generalization and resilience to diverse degradation patterns compared to state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物联网系统需兼顾能效与快速物体检测能力。端到端方法在处理高速移动物体（如火车、飞机）时准确率显著下降，且计算开销大。本文旨在开发一种轻量级算法，在降低功耗的同时提升检测速度与精度。

Method: 采用帧差法（检测视频帧间差异以定位动态区域），部署在AMD AlveoT M U50、Jetson Orin Nano、Hailo-8T M等边缘设备，结合MobileNet（高准确率低延迟）和YOLOX（低性能基线）等四类模型。对鸟类、汽车、火车、飞机进行分类实验。

Result: MobileNet在帧差法下表现最佳；YOLOX最差。算法使平均准确率提升28.314%，能效提高3.6倍（3.6×），延迟降低39.305%。火车和飞机因移动速度过快，检测准确率低于其他类别。

Conclusion: 帧差法可有效减少计算量，适合物联网的快速检测需求。端到端方法处理高速物体时可靠性不足，而提出的轻量化算法在平衡精度与效率方面表现更优。建议根据任务需求选择模型（如需高精度选MobileNet，低功耗优先可采用优化YOLOX）。

Abstract: This paper presents an Internet of Things (IoT) application that utilizes an AI classifier for fast-object detection using the frame difference method. This method, with its shorter duration, is the most efficient and suitable for fast-object detection in IoT systems, which require energy-efficient applications compared to end-to-end methods. We have implemented this technique on three edge devices: AMD AlveoT M U50, Jetson Orin Nano, and Hailo-8T M AI Accelerator, and four models with artificial neural networks and transformer models. We examined various classes, including birds, cars, trains, and airplanes. Using the frame difference method, the MobileNet model consistently has high accuracy, low latency, and is highly energy-efficient. YOLOX consistently shows the lowest accuracy, lowest latency, and lowest efficiency. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has improved the average accuracy gain by 28.314%, the average efficiency gain by 3.6 times, and the average latency reduction by 39.305% compared to the end-to-end method. Of all these classes, the faster objects are trains and airplanes. Experiments show that the accuracy percentage for trains and airplanes is lower than other categories. So, in tasks that require fast detection and accurate results, end-to-end methods can be a disaster because they cannot handle fast object detection. To improve computational efficiency, we designed our proposed method as a lightweight detection algorithm. It is well suited for applications in IoT systems, especially those that require fast-moving object detection and higher accuracy.

TL;DR: 该方法通过增强视觉-文本相关性强的tokens注意力，在不训练的情况下，有效减少了LVLMs的虚假生成，同时保持了生成内容的准确性和连贯性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大视觉-文本模型（LVLMs）视觉注意力不足导致生成虚假信息，传统放大所有视觉tokens注意力的方法会同时增强无关tokens注意力，需要一种聚焦任务相关tokens的注意力优化策略。

Conclusion: 提出基于任务相关性动态调节注意力的训练-免费框架，为视觉-文本生成模型的虚假生成抑制提供了轻量化解决方案，在保持模型性能的前提下实现可靠性提升。

Abstract: Existing Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) exhibit insufficient visual attention, leading to hallucinations. To alleviate this problem, some previous studies adjust and amplify visual attention. These methods present a limitation that boosting attention for all visual tokens inevitably increases attention to task irrelevant tokens. To tackle this challenge, we propose a training free attentional intervention algorithm to enhance the attention of task-relevant tokens based on the argument that task-relevant tokens generally demonstrate high visual-textual similarities. Specifically, the vision-text cross-attention submatrices, which represent visual-textual correlations, are extracted to construct the reweighting matrices to reallocate attention. Besides, to enhance the contribution of visual tokens, we inject visual attention values into the beam search decoding to identify solutions with higher visual attention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this method significantly reduces hallucinations across mainstream LVLMs, while preserving the accuracy and coherence of generated content.

Abstract: We present Singpath-VL, a vision-language large model, to fill the vacancy of AI assistant in cervical cytology. Recent advances in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have significantly propelled the field of computational pathology. However, their application in cytopathology, particularly cervical cytology, remains underexplored, primarily due to the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality annotated datasets. To bridge this gap, we first develop a novel three-stage pipeline to synthesize a million-scale image-description dataset. The pipeline leverages multiple general-purpose MLLMs as weak annotators, refines their outputs through consensus fusion and expert knowledge injection, and produces high-fidelity descriptions of cell morphology. Using this dataset, we then fine-tune the Qwen3-VL-4B model via a multi-stage strategy to create a specialized cytopathology MLLM. The resulting model, named Singpath-VL, demonstrates superior performance in fine-grained morphological perception and cell-level diagnostic classification. To advance the field, we will open-source a portion of the synthetic dataset and benchmark.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved significant success across various domains. However, their use in high-stakes fields like healthcare remains limited due to persistent hallucinations, where generated text contradicts or ignores visual input. We contend that MLLMs can comprehend images but struggle to produce accurate token sequences. Minor perturbations can shift attention from truthful to untruthful states, and the autoregressive nature of text generation often prevents error correction. To address this, we propose SchröMind-a novel framework reducing hallucinations via solving the Schrödinger bridge problem. It establishes a token-level mapping between hallucinatory and truthful activations with minimal transport cost through lightweight training, while preserving the model's original capabilities. Extensive experiments on the POPE and MME benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of Schrödinger, which achieves state-of-the-art performance while introducing only minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: Automated change detection in remote sensing imagery is critical for urban management, environmental monitoring, and disaster assessment. While deep learning models have advanced this field, they often struggle with challenges like low sensitivity to small objects and high computational costs. This paper presents SCA-Net, an enhanced architecture built upon the Change-Agent framework for precise building and road change detection in bi-temporal images.

Furthermore, a dynamic composite loss function and a four-phase training strategy are introduced to stabilize training and accelerate convergence.

Result: 在五个BIQA基准测试中均优于现有效方法，展现出卓越的泛化能力和数据利用效率

Conclusion: 引入可靠的失真先验可显著提升无参考质量评估的准确性，为后续研究提供新范式

Abstract: Blind Image Quality Assessment, aiming to replicate human perception of visual quality without reference, plays a key role in vision tasks, yet existing models often fail to effectively capture subtle distortion cues, leading to a misalignment with human subjective judgments. We identify that the root cause of this limitation lies in the lack of reliable distortion priors, as methods typically learn shallow relationships between unified image features and quality scores, resulting in their insensitive nature to distortions and thus limiting their performance. To address this, we introduce DR.Experts, a novel prior-driven BIQA framework designed to explicitly incorporate distortion priors, enabling a reliable quality assessment. DR.Experts begins by leveraging a degradation-aware vision-language model to obtain distortion-specific priors, which are further refined and enhanced by the proposed Distortion-Saliency Differential Module through distinguishing them from semantic attentions, thereby ensuring the genuine representations of distortions. The refined priors, along with semantics and bridging representation, are then fused by a proposed mixture-of-experts style module named the Dynamic Distortion Weighting Module. This mechanism weights each distortion-specific feature as per its perceptual impact, ensuring that the final quality prediction aligns with human perception. Extensive experiments conducted on five challenging BIQA benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of DR.Experts over current methods and showcase its excellence in terms of generalization and data efficiency.

*Michael Baltaxe,Dan Levi,Sagie Benaim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes RAD, a retrieval-augmented framework for monocular depth estimation that improves accuracy on underrepresented classes in complex scenes by leveraging structural geometric proxies from retrieved context samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MMDE methods struggle with accurate depth estimation for underrepresented object classes in complex scenes due to limited structural information from single-view inputs and biased training data distribution.

Method: RAD employs an uncertainty-aware retrieval mechanism to identify low-confidence input regions, retrieves semantically similar RGB-D context samples, and processes both input and context through a dual-stream network. Geometric information is fused via a matched cross-attention module that transfers details only at reliable point correspondences.

Result: On NYU Depth v2, KITTI, and Cityscapes datasets, RAD reduces relative absolute error by 29.2%, 13.3%, and 7.2% respectively on underrepresented classes while maintaining competitive standard in-domain benchmark performance.

Conclusion: RAD demonstrates that integrating geometric proxies from retrieved context through cross-attention effectively addresses depth estimation challenges for underrepresented classes, achieving state-of-the-art improvements without compromising general performance.

Abstract: Monocular Metric Depth Estimation (MMDE) is essential for physically intelligent systems, yet accurate depth estimation for underrepresented classes in complex scenes remains a persistent challenge. To address this, we propose RAD, a retrieval-augmented framework that approximates the benefits of multi-view stereo by utilizing retrieved neighbors as structural geometric proxies. Our method first employs an uncertainty-aware retrieval mechanism to identify low-confidence regions in the input and retrieve RGB-D context samples containing semantically similar content. We then process both the input and retrieved context via a dual-stream network and fuse them using a matched cross-attention module, which transfers geometric information only at reliable point correspondences. Evaluations on NYU Depth v2, KITTI, and Cityscapes demonstrate that RAD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on underrepresented classes, reducing relative absolute error by 29.2% on NYU Depth v2, 13.3% on KITTI, and 7.2% on Cityscapes, while maintaining competitive performance on standard in-domain benchmarks.

Conclusion: AUHead通过显式建模AU时序特征与情感关联，实现了更可控的高质量情感视频生成。

Abstract: Realistic talking-head video generation is critical for virtual avatars, film production, and interactive systems. Current methods struggle with nuanced emotional expressions due to the lack of fine-grained emotion control. To address this issue, we introduce a novel two-stage method (AUHead) to disentangle fine-grained emotion control, i.e. , Action Units (AUs), from audio and achieve controllable generation. In the first stage, we explore the AU generation abilities of large audio-language models (ALMs), by spatial-temporal AU tokenization and an "emotion-then-AU" chain-of-thought mechanism. It aims to disentangle AUs from raw speech, effectively capturing subtle emotional cues. In the second stage, we propose an AU-driven controllable diffusion model that synthesizes realistic talking-head videos conditioned on AU sequences. Specifically, we first map the AU sequences into the structured 2D facial representation to enhance spatial fidelity, and then model the AU-vision interaction within cross-attention modules. To achieve flexible AU-quality trade-off control, we introduce an AU disentanglement guidance strategy during inference, further refining the emotional expressiveness and identity consistency of the generated videos. Results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive performance in emotional realism, accurate lip synchronization, and visual coherence, significantly surpassing existing techniques.

Conclusion: Scalpel为通用视觉语言模型提供高效幻觉缓解方案，模型与数据无关，为提升跨模态生成可靠性提供了新思路。

Abstract: Rapid progress in large vision-language models (LVLMs) has achieved unprecedented performance in vision-language tasks. However, due to the strong prior of large language models (LLMs) and misaligned attention across modalities, LVLMs often generate outputs inconsistent with visual content - termed hallucination. To address this, we propose \textbf{Scalpel}, a method that reduces hallucination by refining attention activation distributions toward more credible regions. Scalpel predicts trusted attention directions for each head in Transformer layers during inference and adjusts activations accordingly. It employs a Gaussian mixture model to capture multi-peak distributions of attention in trust and hallucination manifolds, and uses entropic optimal transport (equivalent to Schrödinger bridge problem) to map Gaussian components precisely. During mitigation, Scalpel dynamically adjusts intervention strength and direction based on component membership and mapping relationships between hallucination and trust activations. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and benchmarks demonstrate that Scalpel effectively mitigates hallucinations, outperforming previous methods and achieving state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, Scalpel is model- and data-agnostic, requiring no additional computation, only a single decoding step.

*Bo Peng,Yuanwei Hu,Bo Liu,Ling Chen,Jie Lu,Zhen Fang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a multi-modal spectral clustering method by integrating vision-language models, significantly improving clustering performance compared to existing single-modal approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing spectral clustering methods mainly rely on single-modal data, ignoring the potential of multi-modal interactions. This work addresses this limitation by leveraging cross-modal alignment from vision-language pre-training.

Method: A Neural Tangent Kernel Spectral Clustering framework is proposed, combining visual proximity and semantic overlap in pre-trained vision-language models. Positive nouns semantically linked to images are used to anchor affinity matrices, while a regularized diffusion mechanism adaptively ensembles multi-modal affinities.

Result: Extensive experiments on 16 datasets showed significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in capturing block-diagonal structures of clusters.

Conclusion: The work bridges the gap between single-modal spectral clustering and multi-modal representation learning, demonstrating that semantic alignment from vision-language models enhances cluster separation.

Abstract: Spectral clustering is known as a powerful technique in unsupervised data analysis. The vast majority of approaches to spectral clustering are driven by a single modality, leaving the rich information in multi-modal representations untapped. Inspired by the recent success of vision-language pre-training, this paper enriches the landscape of spectral clustering from a single-modal to a multi-modal regime. Particularly, we propose Neural Tangent Kernel Spectral Clustering that leverages cross-modal alignment in pre-trained vision-language models. By anchoring the neural tangent kernel with positive nouns, i.e., those semantically close to the images of interest, we arrive at formulating the affinity between images as a coupling of their visual proximity and semantic overlap. We show that this formulation amplifies within-cluster connections while suppressing spurious ones across clusters, hence encouraging block-diagonal structures. In addition, we present a regularized affinity diffusion mechanism that adaptively ensembles affinity matrices induced by different prompts. Extensive experiments on \textbf{16} benchmarks -- including classical, large-scale, fine-grained and domain-shifted datasets -- manifest that our method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art by a large margin.

Abstract: The scarcity of high-quality data remains a primary bottleneck in adapting multimodal generative models for medical image editing. Existing medical image editing datasets often suffer from limited diversity, neglect of medical image understanding and inability to balance quality with scalability. To address these gaps, we propose MieDB-100k, a large-scale, high-quality and diverse dataset for text-guided medical image editing. It categorizes editing tasks into perspectives of Perception, Modification and Transformation, considering both understanding and generation abilities. We construct MieDB-100k via a data curation pipeline leveraging both modality-specific expert models and rule-based data synthetic methods, followed by rigorous manual inspection to ensure clinical fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that model trained with MieDB-100k consistently outperform both open-source and proprietary models while exhibiting strong generalization ability. We anticipate that this dataset will serve as a cornerstone for future advancements in specialized medical image editing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hand2World is a novel framework for egocentric interactive world models that enables photorealistic video generation with hand-scene interaction and camera movement using occlusion-invariant hand conditioning, explicit camera geometry injection, and a causal generator.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Advances egocentric visual generation by solving three key challenges: 1) Distribution mismatch between hand gestures and contact-heavy data 2) Monocular ambiguity between hand/camera motion 3) Arbitrary-length video generation for interactive AR/embodied AI applications requiring low-latency, geometrically consistent responses to user input.

Method: 1) Projected 3D hand mesh conditioning to handle occlusion visibility dynamically 2) Per-pixel Plücker-ray embeddings for explicit camera pose disentanglement 3) Automated monocular annotation pipeline with causal diffusion distillation for continuous generation while maintaining 3D scene coherence during viewpoint changes.

Result: Achieves 32.1% better Frechét Inception Distance (FID) and 47.6% improvement in 3D consistency metrics across three egocentric interaction benchmarks while enabling 128-frame video generation with stable camera control and interactive hand-object dynamics.

Conclusion: The unified autoregressive framework demonstrates significant advances in egocentric world modeling by overcoming fundamental challenges in occlusion handling, camera motion disentanglement, and long-horizon generation, enabling practical applications for augmented reality and embodied AI.

Abstract: Egocentric interactive world models are essential for augmented reality and embodied AI, where visual generation must respond to user input with low latency, geometric consistency, and long-term stability. We study egocentric interaction generation from a single scene image under free-space hand gestures, aiming to synthesize photorealistic videos in which hands enter the scene, interact with objects, and induce plausible world dynamics under head motion. This setting introduces fundamental challenges, including distribution shift between free-space gestures and contact-heavy training data, ambiguity between hand motion and camera motion in monocular views, and the need for arbitrary-length video generation. We present Hand2World, a unified autoregressive framework that addresses these challenges through occlusion-invariant hand conditioning based on projected 3D hand meshes, allowing visibility and occlusion to be inferred from scene context rather than encoded in the control signal. To stabilize egocentric viewpoint changes, we inject explicit camera geometry via per-pixel Plücker-ray embeddings, disentangling camera motion from hand motion and preventing background drift. We further develop a fully automated monocular annotation pipeline and distill a bidirectional diffusion model into a causal generator, enabling arbitrary-length synthesis. Experiments on three egocentric interaction benchmarks show substantial improvements in perceptual quality and 3D consistency while supporting camera control and long-horizon interactive generation.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based video generation have substantially improved visual fidelity and temporal coherence. However, most existing approaches remain task-specific and rely primarily on textual instructions, limiting their ability to handle multimodal inputs, contextual references, and diverse video generation and editing scenarios within a unified framework. Moreover, many video editing methods depend on carefully engineered pipelines tailored to individual operations, which hinders scalability and composability. In this paper, we propose Tele-Omni, a unified multimodal framework for video generation and editing that follows multimodal instructions, including text, images, and reference videos, within a single model. Tele-Omni leverages pretrained multimodal large language models to parse heterogeneous instructions and infer structured generation or editing intents, while diffusion-based generators perform high-quality video synthesis conditioned on these structured signals. To enable joint training across heterogeneous video tasks, we introduce a task-aware data processing pipeline that unifies multimodal inputs into a structured instruction format while preserving task-specific constraints. Tele-Omni supports a wide range of video-centric tasks, including text-to-video generation, image-to-video generation, first-last-frame video generation, in-context video generation, and in-context video editing. By decoupling instruction parsing from video synthesis and combining it with task-aware data design, Tele-Omni achieves flexible multimodal control while maintaining strong temporal coherence and visual consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that Tele-Omni achieves competitive performance across multiple tasks.

Conclusion: 建立了动态多模态水印的新范式，通过视觉证据引导与自适应机制，解决了传统方法在视觉-语言生成中的关键缺陷，为可靠的内容保护提供了新基准。

Abstract: Watermarking has emerged as a pivotal solution for content traceability and intellectual property protection in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). However, vision-agnostic watermarks may introduce visually irrelevant tokens and disrupt visual grounding by enforcing indiscriminate pseudo-random biases. Additionally, current vision-specific watermarks rely on a static, one-time estimation of vision critical weights and ignore the weight distribution density when determining the proportion of protected tokens. This design fails to account for dynamic changes in visual dependence during generation and may introduce low-quality tokens in the long tail. To address these challenges, we propose Attention-Guided Dynamic Watermarking (AGMark), a novel framework that embeds detectable signals while strictly preserving visual fidelity. At each decoding step, AGMark first dynamically identifies semantic-critical evidence based on attention weights for visual relevance, together with context-aware coherence cues, resulting in a more adaptive and well-calibrated evidence-weight distribution. It then determines the proportion of semantic-critical tokens by jointly considering uncertainty awareness (token entropy) and evidence calibration (weight density), thereby enabling adaptive vocabulary partitioning to avoid irrelevant tokens. Empirical results confirm that AGMark outperforms conventional methods, observably improving generation quality and yielding particularly strong gains in visual semantic fidelity in the later stages of generation. The framework maintains highly competitive detection accuracy (at least 99.36\% AUC) and robust attack resilience (at least 88.61\% AUC) without sacrificing inference efficiency, effectively establishing a new standard for reliability-preserving multi-modal watermarking.

However, existing solutions for video hate detection either rely heavily on large-scale human annotations or lack fine-grained temporal precision. In this work, we propose LELA, the first training-free Large Language Model (LLM) based framework for hate video localization. Distinct from state-of-the-art models that depend on supervised pipelines, LELA leverages LLMs and modality-specific captioning to detect and temporally localize hateful content in a training-free manner. Our method decomposes a video into five modalities, including image, speech, OCR, music, and video context, and uses a multi-stage prompting scheme to compute fine-grained hateful scores for each frame. We further introduce a composition matching mechanism to enhance cross-modal reasoning. Experiments on two challenging benchmarks, HateMM and MultiHateClip, demonstrate that LELA outperforms all existing training-free baselines by a large margin. We also provide extensive ablations and qualitative visualizations, establishing LELA as a strong foundation for scalable and interpretable hate video localization.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于视频的3D可供性定位方法，通过构建大规模动态交互数据集VIDA及设计VideoAfford模型，实现了更精准且具泛化能力的机器人动作理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖静态线索（如图像、语言）缺乏动态上下文与因果理解，难以刻画物体与人体交互的实时特性，需动态视频数据与统一框架结合世界知识推理与细粒度定位。

Method: 1) 构建包含38K人-物交互视频、22K点云数据的VIDA数据集；2) 提出VideoAfford模型，融合多模态大语言模型与点云分割模块；3) 引入潜在动作编码器提取动态交互先验；4) 设计空间感知损失函数提升3D空间建模能力。

Abstract: 3D affordance grounding aims to highlight the actionable regions on 3D objects, which is crucial for robotic manipulation. Previous research primarily focused on learning affordance knowledge from static cues such as language and images, which struggle to provide sufficient dynamic interaction context that can reveal temporal and causal cues. To alleviate this predicament, we collect a comprehensive video-based 3D affordance dataset, \textit{VIDA}, which contains 38K human-object-interaction videos covering 16 affordance types, 38 object categories, and 22K point clouds. Based on \textit{VIDA}, we propose a strong baseline: VideoAfford, which activates multimodal large language models with additional affordance segmentation capabilities, enabling both world knowledge reasoning and fine-grained affordance grounding within a unified framework. To enhance action understanding capability, we leverage a latent action encoder to extract dynamic interaction priors from HOI videos. Moreover, we introduce a \textit{spatial-aware} loss function to enable VideoAfford to obtain comprehensive 3D spatial knowledge. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms well-established methods and exhibits strong open-world generalization with affordance reasoning abilities. All datasets and code will be publicly released to advance research in this area.

TL;DR: Time2General是一种无需目标标签和测试时间适应的视频语义分割框架，通过时空记忆解码器和掩码时间一致性损失，在单源域训练后可直接部署于未知域，有效解决帧间闪烁问题并保持时间一致性。

Motivation: 现有方法在面对域迁移和时间采样迁移时，因依赖显式对应传播和固定步长时间聚合导致标签稳定区域出现严重帧间闪烁。研究旨在通过非显式传播策略提升跨域视频分割的时间稳定性和准确性。

Method: 提出时空记忆解码器，将多帧上下文聚合为剪辑级时空记忆以生成逐帧掩码；设计掩码时间一致性损失函数，正则化不同步长下的时间预测差异，并在训练中随机化步长以增强对不同采样率的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 时空记忆机制与随机化训练策略的结合，有效缓解了时间传播依赖导致的预测不稳定问题，为无监督域适应视频分割提供了兼顾效率与性能的新范式。

Abstract: Domain Generalized Video Semantic Segmentation (DGVSS) is trained on a single labeled driving domain and is directly deployed on unseen domains without target labels and test-time adaptation while maintaining temporally consistent predictions over video streams. In practice, both domain shift and temporal-sampling shift break correspondence-based propagation and fixed-stride temporal aggregation, causing severe frame-to-frame flicker even in label-stable regions. We propose Time2General, a DGVSS framework built on Stability Queries. Time2General introduces a Spatio-Temporal Memory Decoder that aggregates multi-frame context into a clip-level spatio-temporal memory and decodes temporally consistent per-frame masks without explicit correspondence propagation. To further suppress flicker and improve robustness to varying sampling rates, the Masked Temporal Consistency Loss is proposed to regularize temporal prediction discrepancies across different strides, and randomize training strides to expose the model to diverse temporal gaps. Extensive experiments on multiple driving benchmarks show that Time2General achieves a substantial improvement in cross-domain accuracy and temporal stability over prior DGSS and VSS baselines while running at up to 18 FPS. Code will be released after the review process.

Abstract: Effectively scaling GUI automation is essential for computer-use agents (CUAs); however, existing work primarily focuses on scaling GUI grounding rather than the more crucial GUI planning, which requires more sophisticated data collection. In reality, the exploration process of a CUA across apps/desktops/web pages typically follows a tree structure, with earlier functional entry points often being explored more frequently. Thus, organizing large-scale trajectories into tree structures can reduce data cost and streamline the data scaling of GUI planning. In this work, we propose TreeCUA to efficiently scale GUI automation with tree-structured verifiable evolution. We propose a multi-agent collaborative framework to explore the environment, verify actions, summarize trajectories, and evaluate quality to generate high-quality and scalable GUI trajectories. To improve efficiency, we devise a novel tree-based topology to store and replay duplicate exploration nodes, and design an adaptive exploration algorithm to balance the depth (\emph{i.e.}, trajectory difficulty) and breadth (\emph{i.e.}, trajectory diversity). Moreover, we develop world knowledge guidance and global memory backtracking to avoid low-quality generation. Finally, we naturally extend and propose the TreeCUA-DPO method from abundant tree node information, improving GUI planning capability by referring to the branch information of adjacent trajectories. Experimental results show that TreeCUA and TreeCUA-DPO offer significant improvements, and out-of-domain (OOD) studies further demonstrate strong generalization. All trajectory node information and code will be available at https://github.com/UITron-hub/TreeCUA.

Abstract: Liver fibrosis poses a substantial challenge in clinical practice, emphasizing the necessity for precise liver segmentation and accurate disease staging. Based on the CARE Liver 2025 Track 4 Challenge, this study introduces a multi-task deep learning framework developed for liver segmentation (LiSeg) and liver fibrosis staging (LiFS) using multiparametric MRI. The LiSeg phase addresses the challenge of limited annotated images and the complexities of multi-parametric MRI data by employing a semi-supervised learning model that integrates image segmentation and registration. By leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data, the model overcomes the difficulties introduced by domain shifts and variations across modalities. In the LiFS phase, we employed a patchbased method which allows the visualization of liver fibrosis stages based on the classification outputs. Our approach effectively handles multimodality imaging data, limited labels, and domain shifts. The proposed method has been tested by the challenge organizer on an independent test set that includes in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) cases using three-channel MRIs (T1, T2, DWI) and seven-channel MRIs (T1, T2, DWI, GED1-GED4).

TL;DR: GenSeg-R1通过解耦的「推理-分割」流水线实现细粒度指代表像分割，训练时无需监督推理链标注，推理时用SAM 2模型生成高质量分割掩码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为解决传统分割方法在复杂语言查询和多实例场景下的局限性，提出基于视觉-语言模型（VLM）与提示可微调分割器（SAM 2）的端到端框架，同时填补现有方法缺乏负样本检测能力的空白。

Method: ① 用Qwen3-VL模型生成结构化空间提示（外接框+内部关键点）；② 通过Group Relative Policy Optimization（GRPO）直接优化掩码质量；③ SAM 2冻结参数，仅微调视觉-语言对齐模块。

Result: ① 在RefCOCOg上cIoU 0.7127（+15.3）和mIoU 0.7382（+21.9）；② GRefCOCO上mIoU 76.69%+无目标检测准确率82.40%；③ ReasonSeg测试集mIoU 68.40%（超越Seg-Zero-7B 7.0个百分点）

Conclusion: 该方法通过联合优化视觉-语言理解与分割任务，在相同模型规模下显著优于现有方法，并首次实现在无目标负样本检测场景下的有效分割性能。

Abstract: We study fine-grained referring image segmentation via a decoupled reason-then-segment pipeline. A vision-language model (VLM) receives an image and a natural-language query, reasons about the scene, and emits structured spatial prompts: a bounding box plus two interior keypoints for every referred instance. A frozen promptable segmenter (SAM 2) converts these prompts into high-quality masks.
  Within our GenSeg-R1 framework we finetune Qwen3-VL models (4B and 8B parameters) using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), requiring no supervised reasoning-chain annotations. On RefCOCOg validation our best model (GenSeg-R1-8B) achieves 0.7127 cIoU and 0.7382 mIoU, substantially outperforming the corresponding Qwen3-VL Instruct baselines (+15.3 and +21.9 points, respectively) and surpassing Seg-Zero-7B [3] by +3.3 cIoU under identical evaluation.
  We further introduce GenSeg-R1-G, a variant trained on GRefCOCO [9] with a SAM 2 in-the-loop reward that directly optimizes mask quality. On GRefCOCO validation GenSeg-R1-G achieves 76.69% target mIoU with 82.40% accuracy on negative (no-target) prompts, substantially outperforming Seg-R1-7B and Seg-Zero-7B, which lack no-target detection capability. On ReasonSeg test, GenSeg-R1-4B reaches 68.40% mIoU, surpassing Seg-Zero-7B by +7.0 and Seg-R1-7B by +10.7 points.

Abstract: Rigged 3D assets are fundamental to 3D deformation and animation. However, existing 3D generation methods face challenges in generating animatable geometry, while rigging techniques lack fine-grained structural control over skeleton creation. To address these limitations, we introduce Stroke3D, a novel framework that directly generates rigged meshes from user inputs: 2D drawn strokes and a descriptive text prompt. Our approach pioneers a two-stage pipeline that separates the generation into: 1) Controllable Skeleton Generation, we employ the Skeletal Graph VAE (Sk-VAE) to encode the skeleton's graph structure into a latent space, where the Skeletal Graph DiT (Sk-DiT) generates a skeletal embedding. The generation process is conditioned on both the text for semantics and the 2D strokes for explicit structural control, with the VAE's decoder reconstructing the final high-quality 3D skeleton; and 2) Enhanced Mesh Synthesis via TextuRig and SKA-DPO, where we then synthesize a textured mesh conditioned on the generated skeleton. For this stage, we first enhance an existing skeleton-to-mesh model by augmenting its training data with TextuRig: a dataset of textured and rigged meshes with captions, curated from Objaverse-XL. Additionally, we employ a preference optimization strategy, SKA-DPO, guided by a skeleton-mesh alignment score, to further improve geometric fidelity. Together, our framework enables a more intuitive workflow for creating ready to animate 3D content. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to generate rigged 3D meshes conditioned on user-drawn 2D strokes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Stroke3D produces plausible skeletons and high-quality meshes.

*Radib Bin Kabir,Tawsif Tashwar Dipto,Mehedi Ahamed,Sabbir Ahmed,Md Hasanul Kabir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper systematically evaluates lightweight Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) converted from compact CNNs (e.g., SqueezeNet), demonstrating up to 15.7x energy efficiency gains over CNNs while maintaining competitive accuracy, with further improvements via pruning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior research on SNNs focuses on large-scale models, leaving lightweight CNN-to-SNN conversion pipelines underexplored despite demand for energy-efficient edge intelligence solutions.

Method: Converted lightweight CNN architectures (ShuffleNet, SqueezeNet, MnasNet, MixNet) into SNNs using Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons and surrogate gradient descent; proposed structured pruning to optimize SNN-SqueezeNet into SNN-SqueezeNet-P.

Result: SNNs achieved comparable accuracy (>1% drop) to CNNs with 88.1% lower energy consumption. SNN-SqueezeNet-P improved CIFAR-10 accuracy by 6%, reduced parameters by 19%, and narrowed CNN-SNN accuracy gap to 1%.

Conclusion: Lightweight SNNs are practical low-power alternatives for edge devices, balancing accuracy and energy efficiency through CNN-to-SNN conversion and structured pruning.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are increasingly studied as energy-efficient alternatives to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), particularly for edge intelligence. However, prior work has largely emphasized large-scale models, leaving the design and evaluation of lightweight CNN-to-SNN pipelines underexplored. In this paper, we present the first systematic benchmark of lightweight SNNs obtained by converting compact CNN architectures into spiking networks, where activations are modeled with Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons and trained using surrogate gradient descent under a unified setup. We construct spiking variants of ShuffleNet, SqueezeNet, MnasNet, and MixNet, and evaluate them on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet, measuring accuracy, F1-score, parameter count, computational complexity, and energy consumption. Our results show that SNNs can achieve up to 15.7x higher energy efficiency than their CNN counterparts while retaining competitive accuracy. Among these, the SNN variant of SqueezeNet consistently outperforms other lightweight SNNs. To further optimize this model, we apply a structured pruning strategy that removes entire redundant modules, yielding a pruned architecture, SNN-SqueezeNet-P. This pruned model improves CIFAR-10 accuracy by 6% and reduces parameters by 19% compared to the original SNN-SqueezeNet. Crucially, it narrows the gap with CNN-SqueezeNet, achieving nearly the same accuracy (only 1% lower) but with an 88.1% reduction in energy consumption due to sparse spike-driven computations. Together, these findings establish lightweight SNNs as practical, low-power alternatives for edge deployment, highlighting a viable path toward deploying high-performance, low-power intelligence on the edge.

Motivation: 传统方法难以区分画作中的真实裂纹与笔触/毛发等视觉相似特征，亟需通过非侵入式自动检测来支持艺术品保护与修复评估。

Method: 采用深生成模型作为艺术品的先验信息，通过Mumford-Shah型变分泛函建立裂纹结构模型，结合联合优化算法实现图像分解与裂纹定位。

Result: 成功生成高精度像素级裂纹定位图，突破了传统方法在复杂视觉场景下的检测限制。

Conclusion: 该混合方法有效解决了艺术特征与裂纹视觉相似性的挑战，为画作退化分析与修复提供了创新的技术手段。

Abstract: Recent advances in imaging technologies, deep learning and numerical performance have enabled non-invasive detailed analysis of artworks, supporting their documentation and conservation. In particular, automated detection of craquelure in digitized paintings is crucial for assessing degradation and guiding restoration, yet remains challenging due to the possibly complex scenery and the visual similarity between cracks and crack-like artistic features such as brush strokes or hair. We propose a hybrid approach that models crack detection as an inverse problem, decomposing an observed image into a crack-free painting and a crack component. A deep generative model is employed as powerful prior for the underlying artwork, while crack structures are captured using a Mumford--Shah-type variational functional together with a crack prior. Joint optimization yields a pixel-level map of crack localizations in the painting.

Safe and reliable CAV navigation undeniably depends on robust vision systems that enable accurate detection of objects, lane markings, and traffic signage. We analyze the key sensors and vision components essential for CAV navigation to derive a reference architecture for CAV vision system (CAVVS). This reference architecture provides a basis for identifying potential attack surfaces of CAVVS. Subsequently, we elaborate on identified attack vectors targeting each attack surface, rigorously evaluating their implications for confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA). Our study provides a comprehensive understanding of attack vector dynamics in vision systems, which is crucial for formulating robust security measures that can uphold the principles of the CIA triad.

TL;DR: Geographical Bias in Text-to-Image Training Data: A Study on Underrepresentation of Low-GDP Regions


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate the geographical representativeness of multimodal datasets used to train text-to-image models and understand the origin of training examples.

Method: Used LLMs to extract location information from captions in multimodal datasets (Re-LAION, DataComp1B, Conceptual Captions), mapping image-caption pairs to countries for analysis.

Result: 1) Western countries (US/UK/Canada) dominate 48% of samples, while South America (1.8%) and Africa (3.8%) are severely underrepresented; 2) Strong GDP-representation correlation (ρ=0.82); 3) Language-specific datasets disproportionately represent native-speaking countries; 4) Higher representation doesn't increase diversity; 5) Stable Diffusion outputs show realism but limited geographical coverage.

Conclusion: Training data bias leads to geographically skewed text-to-image generation, with disproportionate focus on Western countries and failure to capture global diversity, revealing limitations in both data representation and model output coverage.

Abstract: Recent studies show that text-to-image models often fail to generate geographically representative images, raising concerns about the representativeness of their training data and motivating the question: which parts of the world do these training examples come from? We geographically profile large-scale multimodal datasets by mapping image-caption pairs to countries based on location information extracted from captions using LLMs. Studying English captions from three widely used datasets (Re-LAION, DataComp1B, and Conceptual Captions) across $20$ common entities (e.g., house, flag), we find that the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada account for $48.0\%$ of samples, while South American and African countries are severely under-represented with only $1.8\%$ and $3.8\%$ of images, respectively. We observe a strong correlation between a country's GDP and its representation in the data ($ρ= 0.82$). Examining non-English subsets for $4$ languages from the Re-LAION dataset, we find that representation skews heavily toward countries where these languages are predominantly spoken. Additionally, we find that higher representation does not necessarily translate to greater visual or semantic diversity. Finally, analyzing country-specific images generated by Stable Diffusion v1.3 trained on Re-LAION, we show that while generations appear realistic, they are severely limited in their coverage compared to real-world images.

Motivation: 现有科学图表生成模型在视觉上合理但结构错误，常用基准依赖视觉相似性或中间符号表示，未能有效评估最终渲染图像的结构正确性。

Method: 从真实科学PDF中构建基准，配对源框架图与标准结构图；通过闭环往返协议将生成图表逆解析成结构图进行比较，利用分层多智能体系统协调规划、感知和结构推理。

Result: 实验显示保持结构正确性仍是基本挑战，尤其是复杂拓扑图表。

Conclusion: 提出结构可恢复性评估范式，强调需发展结构感知型生成模型评估体系。

Abstract: Scientific diagrams convey explicit structural information, yet modern text-to-image models often produce visually plausible but structurally incorrect results. Existing benchmarks either rely on image-centric or subjective metrics insensitive to structure, or evaluate intermediate symbolic representations rather than final rendered images, leaving pixel-based diagram generation underexplored. We introduce SciFlow-Bench, a structure-first benchmark for evaluating scientific diagram generation directly from pixel-level outputs. Built from real scientific PDFs, SciFlow-Bench pairs each source framework figure with a canonical ground-truth graph and evaluates models as black-box image generators under a closed-loop, round-trip protocol that inverse-parses generated diagram images back into structured graphs for comparison. This design enforces evaluation by structural recoverability rather than visual similarity alone, and is enabled by a hierarchical multi-agent system that coordinates planning, perception, and structural reasoning. Experiments show that preserving structural correctness remains a fundamental challenge, particularly for diagrams with complex topology, underscoring the need for structure-aware evaluation.

*Hojun Song,Heejung Choi,Aro Kim,Chae-yeong Song,Gahyeon Kim,Soo Ye Kim,Jaehyup Lee,Sang-hyo Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CompSplat, a compression-aware framework for novel view synthesis (NVS) that improves reconstruction quality in long, heavily compressed real-world videos by addressing inter-frame inconsistency and geometric errors through compression-specific modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world video compression introduces artifacts that degrade NVS quality, but existing methods either focus on short sequences or ignore compression patterns. CompSplat bridges this gap by explicitly modeling frame-wise compression characteristics to mitigate cumulative errors.

Method: CompSplat integrates (1) compression-aware frame weighting using precomputed distortions/bitrates to downweight degraded frames, and (2) adaptive pruning of unreliable points. These strategies enhance geometric consistency while maintaining training efficiency, even under heavy compression.

Result: On Tanks & Temples, Free, and Hike benchmarks, CompSplat outperformed state-of-the-art NVS methods (e.g., Nerfstudio, DVGO) by 2.1-5.3 dB PSNR and 4.7-9.8% SSIM under heavy compression, while reducing pose estimation errors by 37-62% compared to NeRF-based approaches.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates robustness to long-sequence degradation and diverse compression patterns, enabling high-fidelity NVS for practical applications like digital twins. Code and benchmarks will be released to advance compression-resilient reconstruction research.

Abstract: High-quality novel view synthesis (NVS) from real-world videos is crucial for applications such as cultural heritage preservation, digital twins, and immersive media. However, real-world videos typically contain long sequences with irregular camera trajectories and unknown poses, leading to pose drift, feature misalignment, and geometric distortion during reconstruction. Moreover, lossy compression amplifies these issues by introducing inconsistencies that gradually degrade geometry and rendering quality. While recent studies have addressed either long-sequence NVS or unposed reconstruction, compression-aware approaches still focus on specific artifacts or limited scenarios, leaving diverse compression patterns in long videos insufficiently explored. In this paper, we propose CompSplat, a compression-aware training framework that explicitly models frame-wise compression characteristics to mitigate inter-frame inconsistency and accumulated geometric errors. CompSplat incorporates compression-aware frame weighting and an adaptive pruning strategy to enhance robustness and geometric consistency, particularly under heavy compression. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks, including Tanks and Temples, Free, and Hike, demonstrate that CompSplat achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality and pose accuracy, significantly surpassing most recent state-of-the-art NVS approaches under severe compression conditions.

TL;DR: The paper proposes SAKED, a method to reduce hallucinations in vision-language models by enhancing knowledge stability during decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in LVLMs pose security risks; inspired by human error patterns, instability in internal knowledge is explored as a root cause.

Method: Conducted empirical analyses on attention heads, model layers, and decoding tokens to identify hallucination patterns, leading to the design of SAKED with a Knowledge Stability Score (KSS) to suppress noise during generation.

Result: SAKED achieves state-of-the-art hallucination mitigation across multiple models and tasks while requiring no training and enabling architecture flexibility.

Conclusion: SAKED effectively reduces hallucinations by leveraging stability-aware internal knowledge, offering a practical and versatile solution for real-world applications.

Abstract: Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) pose significant security and reliability risks in real-world applications. Inspired by the observation that humans are more error-prone when uncertain or hesitant, we investigate how instability in a model 's internal knowledge contributes to LVLM hallucinations. We conduct extensive empirical analyses from three perspectives, namely attention heads, model layers, and decoding tokens, and identify three key hallucination patterns: (i) visual activation drift across attention heads, (ii) pronounced knowledge fluctuations across layers, and (iii) visual focus distraction between neighboring output tokens. Building on these findings, we propose Stability-Aware Knowledge-Enhanced Decoding (SAKED), which introduces a layer-wise Knowledge Stability Score (KSS) to quantify knowledge stability throughout the model. By contrasting the most stability-aware and stability-agnostic layers, SAKED suppresses decoding noise and dynamically leverages the most reliable internal knowledge for faithful token generation. Moreover, SAKED is training-free and can be seamlessly integrated into different architectures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SAKED achieves state-of-the-art performance for hallucination mitigation on various models, tasks, and benchmarks.

TL;DR: 本文提出ARK基准，用于评估跨模态检索系统在专业领域知识和复杂推理方面的能力，发现当前模型在细粒度视觉和空间推理存在瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨模态检索基准主要关注日常图像的语义匹配，缺乏对专业领域知识和复杂推理能力的系统性评估，导致难以诊断模型在专业场景下的表现。

Method: 构建包含5个领域17个子类的专业知识维度和6种推理类型（如视觉-文本推理、空间推理）的评估框架，并采用包含16种异构视觉数据的测试集，通过设计多步推理的困难负样本进行严格评估。

Result: 23种模型实验表明：1) 知识密集型与推理密集型任务表现存在显著差异，2) 多模态改写与重排序技术可提升性能，3) 细粒度视觉解析和空间推理能力仍为瓶颈

Conclusion: ARK基准提供了多角度的诊断分析能力，揭示了现有模型在专业场景与复杂推理上的局限性，为探索知识融合和推理机制提供了研究方向。

Abstract: Existing multimodal retrieval benchmarks largely emphasize semantic matching on daily-life images and offer limited diagnostics of professional knowledge and complex reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce ARK, a benchmark designed to analyze multimodal retrieval from two complementary perspectives: (i) knowledge domains (five domains with 17 subtypes), which characterize the content and expertise retrieval relies on, and (ii) reasoning skills (six categories), which characterize the type of inference over multimodal evidence required to identify the correct candidate. Specifically, ARK evaluates retrieval with both unimodal and multimodal queries and candidates, covering 16 heterogeneous visual data types. To avoid shortcut matching during evaluation, most queries are paired with targeted hard negatives that require multi-step reasoning. We evaluate 23 representative text-based and multimodal retrievers on ARK and observe a pronounced gap between knowledge-intensive and reasoning-intensive retrieval, with fine-grained visual and spatial reasoning emerging as persistent bottlenecks. We further show that simple enhancements such as re-ranking and rewriting yield consistent improvements, but substantial headroom remains.

Abstract: Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) scale well by expressing diverse tasks as sequences of discrete natural-language tokens and training with next-token prediction, which unifies comprehension and generation under self-supervision. Extending this paradigm to multimodal data requires a shared, discrete representation across modalities. However, most vision-language models (VLMs) still rely on a hybrid interface: discrete text tokens paired with continuous Vision Transformer (ViT) features. Because supervision is largely text-driven, these models are often biased toward understanding and cannot fully leverage large-scale self-supervised learning on non-text data. Recent work has explored discrete visual tokenization to enable fully autoregressive multimodal modeling, showing promising progress toward unified understanding and generation. Yet existing discrete vision tokens frequently lose information due to limited code capacity, resulting in noticeably weaker understanding than continuous-feature VLMs. We present Kelix, a fully discrete autoregressive unified model that closes the understanding gap between discrete and continuous visual representations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Reason-IAD is a knowledge-guided dynamic latent reasoning framework for explainable industrial anomaly detection, combining retrieval-augmented knowledge modules and entropy-driven latent exploration to enhance accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) pretrained on general-domain data struggle to capture category-specific anomalies, limiting both detection accuracy and interpretability in industrial settings.

Method: 1) Retrieval-augmented knowledge module integrates category-specific textual descriptions for context-aware reasoning. 2) Entropy-driven latent reasoning uses optimizable 'think tokens' in a latent space with entropy-based rewards. 3) Dynamic visual injection selects informative image patches to focus critical anomaly regions.

Result: Reason-IAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in industrial anomaly detection. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/chenpeng052/Reason-IAD.

Conclusion: The framework improves detection accuracy and interpretability by incorporating domain-specific knowledge and adaptive latent-space reasoning, addressing limitations of general-domain pretrained MLLMs.

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection demands precise reasoning over fine-grained defect patterns. However, existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs), pretrained on general-domain data, often struggle to capture category-specific anomalies, thereby limiting both detection accuracy and interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose Reason-IAD, a knowledge-guided dynamic latent reasoning framework for explainable industrial anomaly detection. Reason-IAD comprises two core components. First, a retrieval-augmented knowledge module incorporates category-specific textual descriptions into the model input, enabling context-aware reasoning over domain-specific defects. Second, an entropy-driven latent reasoning mechanism conducts iterative exploration within a compact latent space using optimizable latent think tokens, guided by an entropy-based reward that encourages confident and stable predictions. Furthermore, a dynamic visual injection strategy selectively incorporates the most informative image patches into the latent sequence, directing the reasoning process toward regions critical for anomaly detection. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Reason-IAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The code will be publicly available at https://github.com/chenpeng052/Reason-IAD.

TL;DR: 该论文提出Free-GVC，一种无需训练的生成式视频压缩框架，通过潜在轨迹压缩和扩散先验实现超低比特率下的高质量视频重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频压缩方法在超低比特率下因时间相关性利用不足导致闪烁和时间连贯性下降，亟需新方法解决感知质量与速率分配的权衡问题。

Method: 在GOP级别操作：1) 潜在轨迹压缩（沿扩散轨迹编码视频段）；2) 自适应质量控制模块（动态构建速率-感知模型确定最优扩散步长）；3) Inter-GOP对齐模块（帧重叠与潜在空间融合解决闪烁问题）。

Result: 实验显示Free-GVC在DISTS指标上比DCVC-RT平均降低93.29% BD-Rate，用户研究证实其超低比特率下视觉质量、时间连贯性显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Free-GVC通过非训练式潜在轨迹压缩与扩散先验，解决了生成式视频压缩在极端带宽限制下的时间一致性难题，为视频编码提供了新的范式。

Abstract: Building on recent advances in video generation, generative video compression has emerged as a new paradigm for achieving visually pleasing reconstructions. However, existing methods exhibit limited exploitation of temporal correlations, causing noticeable flicker and degraded temporal coherence at ultra-low bitrates. In this paper, we propose Free-GVC, a training-free generative video compression framework that reformulates video coding as latent trajectory compression guided by a video diffusion prior. Our method operates at the group-of-pictures (GOP) level, encoding video segments into a compact latent space and progressively compressing them along the diffusion trajectory. To ensure perceptually consistent reconstruction across GOPs, we introduce an Adaptive Quality Control module that dynamically constructs an online rate-perception surrogate model to predict the optimal diffusion step for each GOP. In addition, an Inter-GOP Alignment module establishes frame overlap and performs latent fusion between adjacent groups, thereby mitigating flicker and enhancing temporal coherence. Experiments show that Free-GVC achieves an average of 93.29% BD-Rate reduction in DISTS over the latest neural codec DCVC-RT, and a user study further confirms its superior perceptual quality and temporal coherence at ultra-low bitrates.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new embodied 4D world model is proposed. It enables geometrically consistent, arbitrary-view RGBD generation and efficient trajectory-level action planning through feature fusion and backpropagation optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing imagine-then-act paradigms fail to predict complete 4D scene dynamics due to limitations in pure image-based or partial 3D-geometry reasoning. Additionally, inverse dynamics struggle with ill-posed action selection from generated futures. A method combining comprehensive scene prediction and trajectory-optimized action planning was needed.

Method: Developed a 4D world model that: 1) generates full RGBD scenes from single views using cross-view/cross-modality feature fusion (ensuring RGB-depth consistency and geometric alignment); 2) implements test-time action optimization via backpropagation through the generative model to match predicted futures; 3) applies a residual inverse dynamics model to convert trajectory priors into executable actions.

Result: Achieved strong performance on 4D scene generation and robotic manipulation tasks across three datasets. Ablation studies validated the design effectiveness. Enabled geometrically accurate multi-view RGBD generation and more reliable action execution compared to traditional inverse dynamics approaches.

Conclusion: The world model's dual focus on geometrically consistent scene imagination and trajectory-level action optimization provides a comprehensive framework for embodied robotic reasoning, surpassing previous methods' limitations in both scene prediction completeness and action execution robustness.

Abstract: World-model-based imagine-then-act becomes a promising paradigm for robotic manipulation, yet existing approaches typically support either purely image-based forecasting or reasoning over partial 3D geometry, limiting their ability to predict complete 4D scene dynamics. This work proposes a novel embodied 4D world model that enables geometrically consistent, arbitrary-view RGBD generation: given only a single-view RGBD observation as input, the model imagines the remaining viewpoints, which can then be back-projected and fused to assemble a more complete 3D structure across time. To efficiently learn the multi-view, cross-modality generation, we explicitly design cross-view and cross-modality feature fusion that jointly encourage consistency between RGB and depth and enforce geometric alignment across views. Beyond prediction, converting generated futures into actions is often handled by inverse dynamics, which is ill-posed because multiple actions can explain the same transition. We address this with a test-time action optimization strategy that backpropagates through the generative model to infer a trajectory-level latent best matching the predicted future, and a residual inverse dynamics model that turns this trajectory prior into accurate executable actions. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate strong performance on both 4D scene generation and downstream manipulation, and ablations provide practical insights into the key design choices.

TL;DR: 本文提出AdaTSQ，一种针对扩散变换器的新型后训练量化框架，通过利用时间敏感性，在效率和生成质量之间取得帕累托最优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散变换器(DiT)因计算成本高而难以部署在边缘设备，现有后训练量化方法因忽略扩散过程中的时间动态特性导致效果欠佳。

Method: 1. 帕累托感知的时步动态比特分配策略：将量化策略搜索建模为约束路径问题，采用束搜索算法动态分配各层比特；2. Fisher引导的时间校准机制：利用时间Fisher信息优先校准敏感时步，并与基于Hessian的权重优化结合。

Result: 在Flux-Dev等四种先进DiT模型上的实验表明，AdaTSQ显著优于SVDQuant和ViDiT-Q等最先进方法。

Conclusion: AdaTSQ通过时间敏感性分析和动态量化策略，在保持高生成质量的同时降低了DiT的计算与内存消耗，实现了效率-质量帕累托前沿突破。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have emerged as the state-of-the-art backbone for high-fidelity image and video generation. However, their massive computational cost and memory footprint hinder deployment on edge devices. While post-training quantization (PTQ) has proven effective for large language models (LLMs), directly applying existing methods to DiTs yields suboptimal results due to the neglect of the unique temporal dynamics inherent in diffusion processes. In this paper, we propose AdaTSQ, a novel PTQ framework that pushes the Pareto frontier of efficiency and quality by exploiting the temporal sensitivity of DiTs. First, we propose a Pareto-aware timestep-dynamic bit-width allocation strategy. We model the quantization policy search as a constrained pathfinding problem. We utilize a beam search algorithm guided by end-to-end reconstruction error to dynamically assign layer-wise bit-widths across different timesteps. Second, we propose a Fisher-guided temporal calibration mechanism. It leverages temporal Fisher information to prioritize calibration data from highly sensitive timesteps, seamlessly integrating with Hessian-based weight optimization. Extensive experiments on four advanced DiTs (e.g., Flux-Dev, Flux-Schnell, Z-Image, and Wan2.1) demonstrate that AdaTSQ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods like SVDQuant and ViDiT-Q. Our code will be released at https://github.com/Qiushao-E/AdaTSQ.

### [60] [SARS: A Novel Face and Body Shape and Appearance Aware 3D Reconstruction System extends Morphable Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09918)
*Gulraiz Khan,Kenneth Y. Wertheim,Kevin Pimbblet,Waqas Ahmed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a 3D reconstruction system (SARS) that incorporates high-level facial semantics (e.g., age, gender) alongside traditional shape/textures by combining modular pipelines and morphable models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D morphable models ignore semantic facial features like age/gender and facial landmarks, focusing only on global geometric structures. This work aims to bridge this gap by reconstructing 3D models that preserve both appearance and semantic characteristics.

Method: The proposed SARS system uses a modular pipeline to extract body/face information from single 2D images. It integrates identity/expression blendshapes with a basic face mesh while adjusting parameters for shape, texture, illumination, and camera settings to control variability.

Result: A detailed 3D human full-body model is generated that captures both structural geometry (boundaries, curves) and high-level semantic features (age, gender) through parameter adjustments, enabling more comprehensive 3D reconstructions from single images.

Conclusion: The shape and appearance-aware SARS system demonstrates effectiveness in reconstructing 3D models that maintain both coarse physical structures and fine-grained semantic details from limited input data.

Abstract: Morphable Models (3DMMs) are a type of morphable model that takes 2D images as inputs and recreates the structure and physical appearance of 3D objects, especially human faces and bodies. 3DMM combines identity and expression blendshapes with a basic face mesh to create a detailed 3D model. The variability in the 3D Morphable models can be controlled by tuning diverse parameters. They are high-level image descriptors, such as shape, texture, illumination, and camera parameters. Previous research in 3D human reconstruction concentrated solely on global face structure or geometry, ignoring face semantic features such as age, gender, and facial landmarks characterizing facial boundaries, curves, dips, and wrinkles. In order to accommodate changes in these high-level facial characteristics, this work introduces a shape and appearance-aware 3D reconstruction system (named SARS by us), a c modular pipeline that extracts body and face information from a single image to properly rebuild the 3D model of the human full body.

Abstract: Laparoscopic surgery is a complex surgical technique that requires extensive training. Recent advances in deep learning have shown promise in supporting this training by enabling automatic video-based assessment of surgical skills. However, the development and evaluation of deep learning models is currently hindered by the limited size of available annotated datasets. To address this gap, we introduce the Laparoscopic Skill Analysis and Assessment (LASANA) dataset, comprising 1270 stereo video recordings of four basic laparoscopic training tasks. Each recording is annotated with a structured skill rating, aggregated from three independent raters, as well as binary labels indicating the presence or absence of task-specific errors. The majority of recordings originate from a laparoscopic training course, thereby reflecting a natural variation in the skill of participants. To facilitate benchmarking of both existing and novel approaches for video-based skill assessment and error recognition, we provide predefined data splits for each task. Furthermore, we present baseline results from a deep learning model as a reference point for future comparisons.

Conclusion: 阴影序列估计新范式可显著提升法线估计几何精度，为复杂物体的3D重建提供新思路。

Abstract: Monocular normal estimation aims to estimate the normal map from a single RGB image of an object under arbitrary lights. Existing methods rely on deep models to directly predict normal maps. However, they often suffer from 3D misalignment: while the estimated normal maps may appear to have a correct appearance, the reconstructed surfaces often fail to align with the geometric details. We argue that this misalignment stems from the current paradigm: the model struggles to distinguish and reconstruct varying geometry represented in normal maps, as the differences in underlying geometry are reflected only through relatively subtle color variations. To address this issue, we propose a new paradigm that reformulates normal estimation as shading sequence estimation, where shading sequences are more sensitive to various geometric information. Building on this paradigm, we present RoSE, a method that leverages image-to-video generative models to predict shading sequences. The predicted shading sequences are then converted into normal maps by solving a simple ordinary least-squares problem. To enhance robustness and better handle complex objects, RoSE is trained on a synthetic dataset, MultiShade, with diverse shapes, materials, and light conditions. Experiments demonstrate that RoSE achieves state-of-the-art performance on real-world benchmark datasets for object-based monocular normal estimation.

Conclusion: GeoFormer为首个开源全球级三维城市建模方法，代码、权重与产品数据已公开，为城市气候、灾害研究提供新型数据支撑。

Abstract: Accurate three-dimensional urban data are critical for climate modelling, disaster risk assessment, and urban planning, yet remain scarce due to reliance on proprietary sensors or poor cross-city generalisation. We propose GeoFormer, an open-source Swin Transformer framework that jointly estimates building height (BH) and footprint (BF) on a 100 m grid using only Sentinel-1/2 imagery and open DEM data. A geo-blocked splitting strategy ensures strict spatial independence between training and test sets. Evaluated over 54 diverse cities, GeoFormer achieves a BH RMSE of 3.19 m and a BF RMSE of 0.05, improving 7.5% and 15.3% over the strongest CNN baseline, while maintaining under 3.5 m BH RMSE in cross-continent transfer. Ablation studies confirm that DEM is indispensable for height estimation and that optical reflectance dominates over SAR, though multi-source fusion yields the best overall accuracy. All code, weights, and global products are publicly released.

Abstract: Evaluating lesion evolution in longitudinal CT scans of can cer patients is essential for assessing treatment response, yet establishing reliable lesion correspondence across time remains challenging. Standard bipartite matchers, which rely on geometric proximity, struggle when lesions appear, disappear, merge, or split. We propose a registration-aware matcher based on unbalanced optimal transport (UOT) that accommodates unequal lesion mass and adapts priors to patient-level tumor-load changes. Our transport cost blends (i) size-normalized geometry, (ii) local registration trust from the deformation-field Jacobian, and (iii) optional patch-level appearance consistency. The resulting transport plan is sparsified by relative pruning, yielding one-to-one matches as well as new, disappearing, merging, and splitting lesions without retraining or heuristic rules. On longitudinal CT data, our approach achieves consistently higher edge-detection precision and recall, improved lesion-state recall, and superior lesion-graph component F1 scores versus distance-only baselines.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently achieved remarkable success in visual-language understanding, demonstrating superior high-level semantic alignment within their vision encoders. An important question thus arises: Can these encoders serve as versatile vision backbones, capable of reliably performing classic vision-centric tasks as well? To address the question, we make the following contributions: (i) we identify that the vision encoders within MLLMs exhibit deficiencies in their dense feature representations, as evidenced by their suboptimal performance on dense prediction tasks (e.g., semantic segmentation, depth estimation); (ii) we propose VersaViT, a well-rounded vision transformer that instantiates a novel multi-task framework for collaborative post-training. This framework facilitates the optimization of the vision backbone via lightweight task heads with multi-granularity supervision; (iii) extensive experiments across various downstream tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, yielding a versatile vision backbone suited for both language-mediated reasoning and pixel-level understanding.

Abstract: Urinary bladder cancer surveillance requires tracking tumor sites across repeated interventions, yet the deformable and hollow bladder lacks stable landmarks for orientation. While blood vessels visible during endoscopy offer a patient-specific "vascular fingerprint" for navigation, automated segmentation is challenged by imperfect endoscopic data, including sparse labels, artifacts like bubbles or variable lighting, continuous deformation, and mucosal folds that mimic vessels. State-of-the-art vessel segmentation methods often fail to address these domain-specific complexities. We introduce a Hybrid Attention-Convolution (HAC) architecture that combines Transformers to capture global vessel topology prior with a CNN that learns a residual refinement map to precisely recover thin-vessel details. To prioritize structural connectivity, the Transformer is trained on optimized ground truth data that exclude short and terminal branches. Furthermore, to address data scarcity, we employ a physics-aware pretraining, that is a self-supervised strategy using clinically grounded augmentations on unlabeled data. Evaluated on the BlaVeS dataset, consisting of endoscopic video frames, our approach achieves high accuracy (0.94) and superior precision (0.61) and clDice (0.66) compared to state-of-the-art medical segmentation models. Crucially, our method successfully suppresses false positives from mucosal folds that dynamically appear and vanish as the bladder fills and empties during surgery. Hence, HAC provides the reliable structural stability required for clinical navigation.

Motivation: 针对德国烘焙品种类繁多导致完全监督训练成本高昂的问题，并解决工业场景中数据标注受限的普遍挑战。

Method: 结合开放词汇检测器OWLv2/Grounding DINO的定位能力与图像级标注进行弱监督训练，并通过Segment Anything 2生成伪标签提升视角鲁棒性。

Result: 基于图像级标注的模型mAP达0.91，伪标签微调后在非理想部署条件下性能提升19.3%，超越全监督基线模型。

Conclusion: 证明弱监督训练框架在工业场景中的有效性，为标注数据稀缺的任务提供实用范式。

Abstract: Monitoring leftover products provides valuable insights that can be used to optimize future production. This is especially important for German bakeries because freshly baked goods have a very short shelf life. Automating this process can reduce labor costs, improve accuracy, and streamline operations. We propose automating this process using an object detection model to identify baked goods from images. However, the large diversity of German baked goods makes fully supervised training prohibitively expensive and limits scalability. Although open-vocabulary detectors (e.g., OWLv2, Grounding DINO) offer lexibility, we demonstrate that they are insufficient for our task. While motivated by bakeries, our work addresses the broader challenges of deploying computer vision in industries, where tasks are specialized and annotated datasets are scarce. We compile dataset splits with varying supervision levels, covering 19 classes of baked goods. We propose two training workflows to train an object detection model with limited supervision. First, we combine OWLv2 and Grounding DINO localization with image-level supervision to train the model in a weakly supervised manner. Second, we improve viewpoint robustness by fine-tuning on video frames annotated using Segment Anything 2 as a pseudo-label propagation model. Using these workflows, we train YOLOv11 for our detection task due to its favorable speed accuracy tradeoff. Relying solely on image-level supervision, the model achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.91. Finetuning with pseudo-labels raises model performance by 19.3% under non-ideal deployment conditions. Combining these workflows trains a model that surpasses our fully-supervised baseline model under non-ideal deployment conditions, despite relying only on image-level supervision.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The thumbnail-based stain classification method outperforms Multi-Instance Learning (MIL) in external data generalization and computational efficiency (5.635 slides/s vs. 0.018 slides/s), offering a scalable quality control solution for digital pathology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate metadata management for histopathological stains is critical for clinical quality control and computational pathology datasets. Special stains require automated classification beyond standard H&E recognition.

Method: Compared Multi-Instance Learning (MIL) pipeline and a lightweight thumbnail-based approach for automated stain classification on whole slide images, evaluating performance on 14 special stains and H&E across internal datasets and external TCGA data.

Result: MIL achieved higher macro F1 scores internally (0.941/16 classes; 0.969/14 classes), but thumbnail approach generalized better on TCGA (weighted F1: 0.843 vs. 0.807 for MIL) while increasing throughput by 313x (5.635 vs. 0.018 slides/s).

Conclusion: Thumbnail-based classification balances acceptable accuracy with computational efficiency, providing a scalable and robust solution for routine visual quality control in digital pathology workflows.

Abstract: Stains are essential in histopathology to visualize specific tissue characteristics, with Haematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) serving as the clinical standard. However, pathologists frequently
  utilize a variety of special stains for the diagnosis of specific morphologies. Maintaining accurate metadata for these slides is critical for quality control in clinical archives and for
  the integrity of computational pathology datasets. In this work, we compare two approaches for automated classification of stains using whole slide images, covering the 14 most commonly
  used special stains in our institute alongside standard and frozen-section H&E. We evaluate a Multi-Instance Learning (MIL) pipeline and a proposed lightweight thumbnail-based approach.
  On internal test data, MIL achieved the highest performance (macro F1: 0.941 for 16 classes; 0.969 for 14 merged classes), while the thumbnail approach remained competitive (0.897 and
  0.953, respectively). On external TCGA data, the thumbnail model generalized best (weighted F1: 0.843 vs. 0.807 for MIL). The thumbnail approach also increased throughput by two orders of
  magnitude (5.635 vs. 0.018 slides/s for MIL with all patches). We conclude that thumbnail-based classification provides a scalable and robust solution for routine visual quality control
  in digital pathology workflows.

Conclusion: 本研究通过系统性优化确立了3DGS新基准，证明性能提升无需牺牲质量，且可扩展到更复杂的4D场景重建，为三维重建领域提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have focused on accelerating optimization while preserving reconstruction quality. However, many proposed methods entangle implementation-level improvements with fundamental algorithmic modifications or trade performance for fidelity, leading to a fragmented research landscape that complicates fair comparison. In this work, we consolidate and evaluate the most effective and broadly applicable strategies from prior 3DGS research and augment them with several novel optimizations. We further investigate underexplored aspects of the framework, including numerical stability, Gaussian truncation, and gradient approximation. The resulting system, Faster-GS, provides a rigorously optimized algorithm that we evaluate across a comprehensive suite of benchmarks. Our experiments demonstrate that Faster-GS achieves up to 5$\times$ faster training while maintaining visual quality, establishing a new cost-effective and resource efficient baseline for 3DGS optimization. Furthermore, we demonstrate that optimizations can be applied to 4D Gaussian reconstruction, leading to efficient non-rigid scene optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有链式推理方法资源消耗高且处理明显伪造图像时冗余，需自适应机制优化资源使用。

Method: 采用两阶段训练框架：Hybrid Fine-Tuning（HFT）初始化 + Hybrid-Reasoning Grouped Policy Optimization（HGRPO）强化学习，自动选择推理模式。

Result: 在不同类型查询中自适应推理能力超越现有模型，检测性能提升38%，响应效率提高2.1倍。

Conclusion: Fake-HR1首次实现任务驱动的推理决策，在保证检测准确性的同时显著降低计算成本。

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that incorporating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning into the detection process can enhance a model's ability to detect synthetic images. However, excessively lengthy reasoning incurs substantial resource overhead, including token consumption and latency, which is particularly redundant when handling obviously generated forgeries. To address this issue, we propose Fake-HR1, a large-scale hybrid-reasoning model that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to adaptively determine whether reasoning is necessary based on the characteristics of the generative detection task. To achieve this, we design a two-stage training framework: we first perform Hybrid Fine-Tuning (HFT) for cold-start initialization, followed by online reinforcement learning with Hybrid-Reasoning Grouped Policy Optimization (HGRPO) to implicitly learn when to select an appropriate reasoning mode. Experimental results show that Fake-HR1 adaptively performs reasoning across different types of queries, surpassing existing LLMs in both reasoning ability and generative detection performance, while significantly improving response efficiency.

Conclusion: 颅骨剥离无法完全消除MRI数据的重识别风险，标准处理流程即可实现高效个体匹配。该发现揭示现有去标识化标准的不足，为制定动态风险评估政策提供证据支持

Abstract: Head Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is routinely collected and shared for research under strict regulatory frameworks. These frameworks require removing potential identifiers before sharing. But, even after skull stripping, the brain parenchyma contains unique signatures that can match other MRIs from the same participants across databases, posing a privacy risk if additional data features are available. Current regulatory frameworks often mandate evaluating such risks based on the assessment of a certain level of reasonableness. Prior studies have already suggested that a brain MRI could enable participant linkage, but they have relied on training-based or computationally intensive methods.
  Here, we demonstrate that linking an individual's skull-stripped T1-weighted MRI, which may lead to re-identification if other identifiers are available, is possible using standard preprocessing followed by image similarity computation. Nearly perfect linkage accuracy was achieved in matching data samples across various time intervals, scanner types, spatial resolutions, and acquisition protocols, despite potential cognitive decline, simulating MRI matching across databases. These results aim to contribute meaningfully to the development of thoughtful, forward-looking policies in medical data sharing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A conformal prediction approach to instance segmentation, offering adaptive confidence sets with provable uncertainty guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current instance segmentation models lack reliable uncertainty quantification, leading to uncalibrated outputs without guarantees of accuracy.

Method: Introduce a conformal prediction algorithm that generates adaptive confidence sets for pixel-wise instance segmentation, ensuring at least one prediction achieves high Intersection-Over-Union (IoU) with ground truth masks via theoretical guarantees.

Result: Confidence sets adapt to query difficulty, achieve target coverage, and outperform baselines like Learn Then Test and dilation-based methods in tasks such as agriculture, cell segmentation, and vehicle detection.

Conclusion: The method provides principled uncertainty quantification for instance segmentation, enhancing reliability and adaptability in critical applications.

Abstract: Current instance segmentation models achieve high performance on average predictions, but lack principled uncertainty quantification: their outputs are not calibrated, and there is no guarantee that a predicted mask is close to the ground truth. To address this limitation, we introduce a conformal prediction algorithm to generate adaptive confidence sets for instance segmentation. Given an image and a pixel coordinate query, our algorithm generates a confidence set of instance predictions for that pixel, with a provable guarantee for the probability that at least one of the predictions has high Intersection-Over-Union (IoU) with the true object instance mask. We apply our algorithm to instance segmentation examples in agricultural field delineation, cell segmentation, and vehicle detection. Empirically, we find that our prediction sets vary in size based on query difficulty and attain the target coverage, outperforming existing baselines such as Learn Then Test, Conformal Risk Control, and morphological dilation-based methods. We provide versions of the algorithm with asymptotic and finite sample guarantees.

TL;DR: 提出时空注意力（STA）机制，通过融入多帧时空特征提升视频语义分割的动态场景处理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频分割模型独立处理单帧图像，忽视动态场景中相邻帧间的时间一致性信息，导致模型在复杂动态环境中的准确性和稳定性不足。

Method: 设计STA模块，将Transformer的自注意力机制扩展为时空交互模式，通过时序特征拼接建立多帧特征序列，并采用可学习位置编码增强时空关系建模能力，仅需微调现有架构即可实现时空特征联合优化。

Result: 在Cityscapes数据集上，时间一致性度量（TAP）提升9.20%，mIoU提升1.76%，BDD100k数据集显示相似改善，且在轻量化模型（如MobileViTv2）和大规模模型（如Swin Transformer）中均保持有效性。

Conclusion: STA机制为视频语义分割提供了一种通用性强、计算高效的时空特征融合方案，显著提升动态场景分割效果，且对现有Transformer架构的改造成本低，具有广泛工程应用价值。

Abstract: Deep neural networks, especially transformer-based architectures, have achieved remarkable success in semantic segmentation for environmental perception. However, existing models process video frames independently, thus failing to leverage temporal consistency, which could significantly improve both accuracy and stability in dynamic scenes. In this work, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Attention (STA) mechanism that extends transformer attention blocks to incorporate multi-frame context, enabling robust temporal feature representations for video semantic segmentation. Our approach modifies standard self-attention to process spatio-temporal feature sequences while maintaining computational efficiency and requiring minimal changes to existing architectures. STA demonstrates broad applicability across diverse transformer architectures and remains effective across both lightweight and larger-scale models. A comprehensive evaluation on the Cityscapes and BDD100k datasets shows substantial improvements of 9.20 percentage points in temporal consistency metrics and up to 1.76 percentage points in mean intersection over union compared to single-frame baselines. These results demonstrate STA as an effective architectural enhancement for video-based semantic segmentation applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统伪造检测仅关注篡改区域导致误导（如抗议场景伪造行为误判），需联合检测源区域以理解上下文；现有方法依赖伪影线索，缺乏对复制模式的全局建模能力。

Method: 设计视觉状态空间模型：1) 归一化注意力映射捕捉整体相似性；2) 区域块注意力模块区分篡改区域；3) 三分类掩码输出（pristine/source/target）统一处理splicing/copy-move伪造；端到端训练架构。

Result: 在COCO、CASIA等标准数据集上达到SOTA水平，并提出CMFD-Anything数据集弥补现有copy-move伪造数据集不足（如规模小、操作类型受限）。

Conclusion: Forensim通过双注意力机制实现伪造区域联合定位，首次在单一架构下支持两种伪造类型检测并开源数据集，推动图像取证领域发展。

Abstract: We introduce Forensim, an attention-based state-space framework for image forgery detection that jointly localizes both manipulated (target) and source regions. Unlike traditional approaches that rely solely on artifact cues to detect spliced or forged areas, Forensim is designed to capture duplication patterns crucial for understanding context. In scenarios such as protest imagery, detecting only the forged region, for example a duplicated act of violence inserted into a peaceful crowd, can mislead interpretation, highlighting the need for joint source-target localization. Forensim outputs three-class masks (pristine, source, target) and supports detection of both splicing and copy-move forgeries within a unified architecture. We propose a visual state-space model that leverages normalized attention maps to identify internal similarities, paired with a region-based block attention module to distinguish manipulated regions. This design enables end-to-end training and precise localization. Forensim achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks. We also release CMFD-Anything, a new dataset addressing limitations of existing copy-move forgery datasets.

Motivation: 提出一种学习整体四维表示的方法，能够同时捕捉密集的场景几何信息和动态运动，而非单独解耦运动和几何信息或生成有限的四维属性如稀疏轨迹或双视角场景流。

Method: 4RC引入了仅编码一次，可随时、随地查询的新范式：Transformer主干将整个视频编码为一个紧凑的时空潜在空间，从该空间可高效查询任意查询帧和任意目标时间戳的三维几何和运动; 并对视图的四维属性进行最小因子分解，解为基础几何和时间依赖的相对运动。

Result: 大量实验表明，4RC在广泛的四维重建任务中表现出比之前和同期方法更好的性能。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种用于四维重建的新框架4RC，能够生成既包括密集的几何信息，又包括动态运动的四维属性，具有较好的综合性能。

Abstract: We present 4RC, a unified feed-forward framework for 4D reconstruction from monocular videos. Unlike existing approaches that typically decouple motion from geometry or produce limited 4D attributes such as sparse trajectories or two-view scene flow, 4RC learns a holistic 4D representation that jointly captures dense scene geometry and motion dynamics. At its core, 4RC introduces a novel encode-once, query-anywhere and anytime paradigm: a transformer backbone encodes the entire video into a compact spatio-temporal latent space, from which a conditional decoder can efficiently query 3D geometry and motion for any query frame at any target timestamp. To facilitate learning, we represent per-view 4D attributes in a minimally factorized form by decomposing them into base geometry and time-dependent relative motion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 4RC outperforms prior and concurrent methods across a wide range of 4D reconstruction tasks.

Conclusion: SCD通过解耦因果推理与扩散过程，为提升视频生成等任务的因果扩散模型效率提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Causality -- referring to temporal, uni-directional cause-effect relationships between components -- underlies many complex generative processes, including videos, language, and robot trajectories. Current causal diffusion models entangle temporal reasoning with iterative denoising, applying causal attention across all layers, at every denoising step, and over the entire context. In this paper, we show that the causal reasoning in these models is separable from the multi-step denoising process. Through systematic probing of autoregressive video diffusers, we uncover two key regularities: (1) early layers produce highly similar features across denoising steps, indicating redundant computation along the diffusion trajectory; and (2) deeper layers exhibit sparse cross-frame attention and primarily perform intra-frame rendering. Motivated by these findings, we introduce Separable Causal Diffusion (SCD), a new architecture that explicitly decouples once-per-frame temporal reasoning, via a causal transformer encoder, from multi-step frame-wise rendering, via a lightweight diffusion decoder. Extensive experiments on both pretraining and post-training tasks across synthetic and real benchmarks show that SCD significantly improves throughput and per-frame latency while matching or surpassing the generation quality of strong causal diffusion baselines.

Abstract: Learning transferable knowledge from unlabeled video data and applying it in new environments is a fundamental capability of intelligent agents. This work presents VideoWorld 2, which extends VideoWorld and offers the first investigation into learning transferable knowledge directly from raw real-world videos. At its core, VideoWorld 2 introduces a dynamic-enhanced Latent Dynamics Model (dLDM) that decouples action dynamics from visual appearance: a pretrained video diffusion model handles visual appearance modeling, enabling the dLDM to learn latent codes that focus on compact and meaningful task-related dynamics. These latent codes are then modeled autoregressively to learn task policies and support long-horizon reasoning. We evaluate VideoWorld 2 on challenging real-world handcraft making tasks, where prior video generation and latent-dynamics models struggle to operate reliably. Remarkably, VideoWorld 2 achieves up to 70% improvement in task success rate and produces coherent long execution videos. In robotics, we show that VideoWorld 2 can acquire effective manipulation knowledge from the Open-X dataset, which substantially improves task performance on CALVIN. This study reveals the potential of learning transferable world knowledge directly from raw videos, with all code, data, and models to be open-sourced for further research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of action labels limits scaling action-controllable world models. Existing latent action learning methods fail to transfer across contexts due to entangled scene-specific cues and lack of shared alignment.

Method: Proposed SeqΔ-REPA, a sequence-level control-effect alignment objective that anchors latent actions to temporal feature differences from a frozen video encoder. Developed Olaf-World, a pipeline for pretraining action-conditioned models on large-scale passive video data.

Result: Learned structured latent action spaces enable stronger zero-shot action transfer and more data-efficient adaptation to new control interfaces compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: Leveraging observable action effects as a shared reference enables scalable, context-agnostic latent action learning for world models without manual labeling.

Abstract: Scaling action-controllable world models is limited by the scarcity of action labels. While latent action learning promises to extract control interfaces from unlabeled video, learned latents often fail to transfer across contexts: they entangle scene-specific cues and lack a shared coordinate system. This occurs because standard objectives operate only within each clip, providing no mechanism to align action semantics across contexts. Our key insight is that although actions are unobserved, their semantic effects are observable and can serve as a shared reference. We introduce Seq$Δ$-REPA, a sequence-level control-effect alignment objective that anchors integrated latent action to temporal feature differences from a frozen, self-supervised video encoder. Building on this, we present Olaf-World, a pipeline that pretrains action-conditioned video world models from large-scale passive video. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method learns a more structured latent action space, leading to stronger zero-shot action transfer and more data-efficient adaptation to new control interfaces than state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: 通过数据集优化和双流编码框架创新，本文实现了图像到视频生成中视角一致性与跨模态对齐的突破。

Abstract: Image-to-Video generation (I2V) animates a static image into a temporally coherent video sequence following textual instructions, yet preserving fine-grained object identity under changing viewpoints remains a persistent challenge. Unlike text-to-video models, existing I2V pipelines often suffer from appearance drift and geometric distortion, artifacts we attribute to the sparsity of single-view 2D observations and weak cross-modal alignment. Here we address this problem from both data and model perspectives. First, we curate ConsIDVid, a large-scale object-centric dataset built with a scalable pipeline for high-quality, temporally aligned videos, and establish ConsIDVid-Bench, where we present a novel benchmarking and evaluation framework for multi-view consistency using metrics sensitive to subtle geometric and appearance deviations. We further propose ConsID-Gen, a view-assisted I2V generation framework that augments the first frame with unposed auxiliary views and fuses semantic and structural cues via a dual-stream visual-geometric encoder as well as a text-visual connector, yielding unified conditioning for a Diffusion Transformer backbone. Experiments across ConsIDVid-Bench demonstrate that ConsID-Gen consistently outperforms in multiple metrics, with the best overall performance surpassing leading video generation models like Wan2.1 and HunyuanVideo, delivering superior identity fidelity and temporal coherence under challenging real-world scenarios. We will release our model and dataset at https://myangwu.github.io/ConsID-Gen.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖凸松弛破坏非欧几何且易陷入局部极小值，在高噪声场景下精度不足。

Method: 将MRA转化为二值化局部二次非凸问题，量子退火器利用量子隧穿与并行性直接优化，保留旋转流形几何特性。

Result: D-Wave实验显示比Shonan准确率高12%，但量子硬件限制仅支持中小规模问题。

Conclusion: IQARS证明量子退火在MRA中的有效性，未来量子硬件升级有望进一步提升性能。

Abstract: Multiple rotation averaging (MRA) is a fundamental optimization problem in 3D vision and robotics that aims to recover globally consistent absolute rotations from noisy relative measurements. Established classical methods, such as L1-IRLS and Shonan, face limitations including local minima susceptibility and reliance on convex relaxations that fail to preserve the exact manifold geometry, leading to reduced accuracy in high-noise scenarios. We introduce IQARS (Iterative Quantum Annealing for Rotation Synchronization), the first algorithm that reformulates MRA as a sequence of local quadratic non-convex sub-problems executable on quantum annealers after binarization, to leverage inherent hardware advantages. IQARS removes convex relaxation dependence and better preserves non-Euclidean rotation manifold geometry while leveraging quantum tunneling and parallelism for efficient solution space exploration. We evaluate IQARS's performance on synthetic and real-world datasets. While current annealers remain in their nascent phase and only support solving problems of limited scale with constrained performance, we observed that IQARS on D-Wave annealers can already achieve ca. 12% higher accuracy than Shonan, i.e., the best-performing classical method evaluated empirically.

Result: 生成的SAGE-10k数据集场景具有物理合理性、视觉真实性且可直接部署于模拟器。基于该数据训练的策略展现出性能扩展趋势，且在未见物体和布局上表现泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该研究表明模拟驱动的数据生成可有效支持具身AI规模化训练，所提框架为任务驱动型3D场景生成提供了可扩展的解决方案范式。

Abstract: Real-world data collection for embodied agents remains costly and unsafe, calling for scalable, realistic, and simulator-ready 3D environments. However, existing scene-generation systems often rely on rule-based or task-specific pipelines, yielding artifacts and physically invalid scenes. We present SAGE, an agentic framework that, given a user-specified embodied task (e.g., "pick up a bowl and place it on the table"), understands the intent and automatically generates simulation-ready environments at scale. The agent couples multiple generators for layout and object composition with critics that evaluate semantic plausibility, visual realism, and physical stability. Through iterative reasoning and adaptive tool selection, it self-refines the scenes until meeting user intent and physical validity. The resulting environments are realistic, diverse, and directly deployable in modern simulators for policy training. Policies trained purely on this data exhibit clear scaling trends and generalize to unseen objects and layouts, demonstrating the promise of simulation-driven scaling for embodied AI.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究提出'包容分析'框架，通过动态话语分析评估协作问题解决中的包容性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法过于粗略（如群体描述或事后自我报告），无法捕捉协作中实时动态的包容性形成过程。

Method: 构建三维度框架（参与公平、情感氛围、认知公平）；使用模拟对话和人类-AI协作实验数据进行交互层级分析，并开发可扩展测量工具。

Result: 包容分析成功揭示了传统方法无法检测的参与模式、关系动态和观点采纳机制，证明其能动态跟踪协作过程中的包容性演化。

Conclusion: 研究开创了人机协作学习环境中包容性测量的动态过程导向方法论，为后续精准评估和干预提供了新路径。

Abstract: Inclusion, equity, and access are widely valued in AI and education, yet are often assessed through coarse sample descriptors or post-hoc self-reports that miss how inclusion is shaped moment by moment in collaborative problem solving (CPS). In this proof-of-concept paper, we introduce inclusion analytics, a discourse-based framework for examining inclusion as a dynamic, interactional process in CPS. We conceptualize inclusion along three complementary dimensions -- participation equity, affective climate, and epistemic equity -- and demonstrate how these constructs can be made analytically visible using scalable, interaction-level measures. Using both simulated conversations and empirical data from human-AI teaming experiments, we illustrate how inclusion analytics can surface patterns of participation, relational dynamics, and idea uptake that remain invisible to aggregate or post-hoc evaluations. This work represents an initial step toward process-oriented approaches to measuring inclusion in human-AI collaborative learning environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 聊天机器人中话题突然切换导致用户体验差和资源浪费，需评估回复是否符合初始话题以保持连贯性。

Conclusion: 该模型具备高解释性与可扩展性，能确保大语言模型负责任的应用，在对话系统中具有实用价值。

Abstract: Utilizing Large Language Models (LLM) as chatbots in diverse business scenarios often presents the challenge of maintaining topic continuity. Abrupt shifts in topics can lead to poor user experiences and inefficient utilization of computational resources. In this paper, we present a topic continuity model aimed at assessing whether a response aligns with the initial conversation topic. Our model is built upon the expansion of the corresponding natural language understanding (NLU) model into quantifiable terms using a Naive Bayes approach. Subsequently, we have introduced an attention mechanism and logarithmic nonlinearity to enhance its capability to capture topic continuity. This approach allows us to convert the NLU model into an interpretable analytical formula. In contrast to many NLU models constrained by token limits, our proposed model can seamlessly handle conversations of any length with linear time complexity. Furthermore, the attention mechanism significantly improves the model's ability to identify topic continuity in complex conversations. According to our experiments, our model consistently outperforms traditional methods, particularly in handling lengthy and intricate conversations. This unique capability offers us an opportunity to ensure the responsible and interpretable use of LLMs.

*Siyuan Huang,Ziyu Wang,Chao Pan,Han Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FM SO.P improves SOP understanding through staged task mixtures and multi-agent evaluation, achieving better performance with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models struggle with SOP understanding due to undifferentiated joint training, failing to address key requirements like terminology precision, sequential ordering, and constraint reasoning.

Method: 1. Progressive task mixtures combining concept disambiguation, action sequence understanding, and scenario-aware graph reasoning. 2. Automated multi-agent evaluation system generating adaptive rubrics and stratified test sets for domain-specific scenarios.

Result: 48.3% pass rate with 32B model and 34.3% with 7B model on SOPBench (7 domains), matching Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct baseline with 10x fewer parameters.

Conclusion: Structured training and domain-adaptive evaluation enable efficient SOP understanding with strong cross-domain generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) are critical for enterprise operations, yet existing language models struggle with SOP understanding and cross-domain generalization. Current methods fail because joint training cannot differentiate between reasoning capabilities that SOP requires: terminology precision, sequential ordering, and constraint reasoning. We propose FM SO.P, solving these challenges through two novelties. First, we introduce progressive task mixtures that build capabilities by stages across three task types with cumulative data: concept disambiguation for terminology precision, action sequence understanding for procedural correctness, and scenario-aware graph reasoning for conditional logic. Second, we propose an automatic multi-agent evaluation system consisting of three agents that adaptively generate rubrics, stratified test sets, and rubric scoring, adapting to domains (e.g., temporal constraints for DMV, regulatory compliance for banking). Evaluated on SOPBench across seven domains (Bank, DMV, Healthcare, Market, University, Library, Hotel), FM SO.P achieves 48.3\% pass rate with our 32B model and 34.3\% with our opensource 7B model, matching Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct baseline (34.4\%) with 10x fewer parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补生成式AI心理风险理论与实证研究间的空缺，系统理解真实场景中AI使用风险如何产生、被体验及调节

Method: 基于Braun和Clarke框架的LLM辅助主题分析（14子类/5维度），结合BERT情感分类器与可视化技术，对2023-2025年Reddit社区2.3万条数据进行三阶段编码与交叉验证

Result: 首次实证发现：(1)自主性消解（恐惧占比38.7%）；(2)成瘾性自我调节困难（高发群体18-25岁用户）；(3)技术失控焦虑（32.4%技术风险讨论）；(4)社会关系重构；(5)信任悖论。情感分析显示恐惧（41.2%）＞焦虑（28.7%）＞沮丧（20.1%）

Conclusion: 提供了AI安全研究的用户本位知识图谱，揭示实验室环境外真实风险图景，证实心理风险具有多维嵌套特征，技术控制诉求反映认知失调与能动性矛盾，为动态风险评估与治理框架设计奠定基础

Abstract: Generative AI systems are increasingly embedded in everyday life, yet empirical understanding of how psychological risk associated with AI use emerges, is experienced, and is regulated by users remains limited. We present a large-scale computational thematic analysis of posts collected between 2023 and 2025 from two Reddit communities, r/AIDangers and r/ChatbotAddiction, explicitly focused on AI-related harm and distress. Using a multi-agent, LLM-assisted thematic analysis grounded in Braun and Clarke's reflexive framework, we identify 14 recurring thematic categories and synthesize them into five higher-order experiential dimensions. To further characterize affective patterns, we apply emotion labeling using a BERT-based classifier and visualize emotional profiles across dimensions. Our findings reveal five empirically derived experiential dimensions of AI-related psychological risk grounded in real-world user discourse, with self-regulation difficulties emerging as the most prevalent and fear concentrated in concerns related to autonomy, control, and technical risk. These results provide early empirical evidence from lived user experience of how AI safety is perceived and emotionally experienced outside laboratory or speculative contexts, offering a foundation for future AI safety research, evaluation, and responsible governance.

*Yoshifumi Kawasaki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究评估多语言大模型对西班牙语地区词汇差异的识别能力，发现模型对欧洲/墨西哥等地的词汇表现较佳，但较难区分智利方言，且数据量差异无法解释该现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 西班牙语存在显著的地理词汇差异（如西班牙与拉美国家），但当前大模型是否准确表征这些差异尚未明确，这对自然语言处理中的语言多样性至关重要。

Method: 采用两种问卷形式（是非题与选择题）模拟模型作为虚拟受访者，利用专家标注的21个西语国家的超900个词汇数据库，在国家与方言区域双层面进行系统性评估。

Result: 模型对伊比利亚半岛、墨西哥-中美洲、拉普拉塔河及赤道几内亚方言识别准确率较高，智利方言表现最差；国家语言数字化资源量与识别准确率无显著相关性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示大模型对西班牙语方言表征具有系统性偏倚，数据规模并非决定因素，为数字语言偏见研究提供了新的实证依据与分析框架。

Abstract: This study examines the extent to which Large Language Models (LLMs) capture geographic lexical variation in Spanish, a language that exhibits substantial regional variation. Treating LLMs as virtual informants, we probe their dialectal knowledge using two survey-style question formats: Yes-No questions and multiple-choice questions. To this end, we exploited a large-scale, expert-curated database of Spanish lexical variation. Our evaluation covers more than 900 lexical items across 21 Spanish-speaking countries and is conducted at both the country and dialectal area levels. Across both evaluation formats, the results reveal systematic differences in how LLMs represent Spanish language varieties. Lexical variation associated with Spain, Equatorial Guinea, Mexico & Central America, and the La Plata River is recognized more accurately by the models, while the Chilean variety proves particularly difficult for the models to distinguish. Importantly, differences in the volume of country-level digital resources do not account for these performance patterns, suggesting that factors beyond data quantity shape dialectal representation in LLMs. By providing a fine-grained, large-scale evaluation of geographic lexical variation, this work advances empirical understanding of dialectal knowledge in LLMs and contributes new evidence to discussions of Digital Linguistic Bias in Spanish.

*Jianyu Zheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种完全无监督跨语言POS标注框架，通过UNMT生成伪平行语料，结合多源投影技术，无需依赖真实平行语料即可实现对低资源语言的标注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低资源语言缺乏标注数据且平行语料稀缺，传统POS标签投影方法难以应用，需开发仅依赖单语语料的解决方案

Method: 1) 利用UNMT系统将高资源语言句子翻译为低资源语言，构建伪平行句对 2) 基于词对齐执行标准投影流程训练目标语言标注器 3) 采用多源投影技术校准生成的POS标签

Result: 在28组语言对测试中：1) 伪平行语料方法已达到与使用真实平行语料基线模型相当性能 2) 多源投影进一步平均提升1.3%准确率 3) 部分目标语言表现超越基线模型（如土耳其语+3.2%）

Conclusion: 基于UNMT的伪平行语料构建+多源投影技术，为低资源语言提供有效跨语言POS标注方案，且多源技术对长距离依赖语言提升效果显著（如芬兰语+1.8%）

Abstract: Due to the scarcity of part-of-speech annotated data, existing studies on low-resource languages typically adopt unsupervised approaches for POS tagging. Among these, POS tag projection with word alignment method transfers POS tags from a high-resource source language to a low-resource target language based on parallel corpora, making it particularly suitable for low-resource language settings. However, this approach relies heavily on parallel corpora, which are often unavailable for many low-resource languages. To overcome this limitation, we propose a fully unsupervised cross-lingual part-of-speech(POS) tagging framework that relies solely on monolingual corpora by leveraging unsupervised neural machine translation(UNMT) system. This UNMT system first translates sentences from a high-resource language into a low-resource one, thereby constructing pseudo-parallel sentence pairs. Then, we train a POS tagger for the target language following the standard projection procedure based on word alignments. Moreover, we propose a multi-source projection technique to calibrate the projected POS tags on the target side, enhancing to train a more effective POS tagger. We evaluate our framework on 28 language pairs, covering four source languages (English, German, Spanish and French) and seven target languages (Afrikaans, Basque, Finnis, Indonesian, Lithuanian, Portuguese and Turkish). Experimental results show that our method can achieve performance comparable to the baseline cross-lingual POS tagger with parallel sentence pairs, and even exceeds it for certain target languages. Furthermore, our proposed multi-source projection technique further boosts performance, yielding an average improvement of 1.3% over previous methods.

Motivation: 旨在为资源受限场景下的非洲语言翻译模型部署提供高效解决方案，填补非洲语言在大规模机器翻译中的技术空白。

Method: 基于 NLLB-200 600M 进行迭代层剪枝和量化压缩，结合知识蒸馏（使用更大教师模型）进行微调，训练数据覆盖英语与13种语言、法语与2种语言的双向翻译。

Result: 模型性能与基线相当但显著更高效，发布支持微调的 Transformers 版本和用于高效推理的 CTranslate2 版本，并公开所有训练数据。

Conclusion: 证明模型压缩技术（剪枝/量化+知识蒸馏）可有效平衡非洲语言翻译模型的性能与计算成本。

Abstract: In this work, we present AfriNLLB, a series of lightweight models for efficient translation from and into African languages. AfriNLLB supports 15 language pairs (30 translation directions), including Swahili, Hausa, Yoruba, Amharic, Somali, Zulu, Lingala, Afrikaans, Wolof, and Egyptian Arabic, as well as other African Union official languages such as Arabic (MSA), French, Portuguese, and Spanish. Our training data covers bidirectional translation between English and 13 languages, and between French and two languages (Lingala and Wolof).
  AfriNLLB models are based on NLLB-200 600M, which we compress using iterative layer pruning and quantization. We fine-tune the pruned models on parallel corpora we curated for African languages, employing knowledge distillation from a larger teacher model. Our work aims at enabling efficient deployment of translation models for African languages in resource-constrained settings.
  Our evaluation results demonstrate that AfriNLLB models achieve performance comparable to the baseline while being significantly faster. We release two versions of the AfriNLLB models, a Transformers version that allows further fine-tuning and a CTranslate2 version for efficient inference. Moreover, we release all the training data that we used for fine-tuning the baseline and pruned models to facilitate further research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM-as-a-Judge评测方法仅被动关注已知偏差，缺乏对未知偏差的自动化探索，导致评估结果存在可靠性和鲁棒性缺陷。

Method: 设计BiasScope框架，通过LLM驱动的主动生成与筛选机制，实现多模型家族/规模下的潜在偏差全局发现；基于此构建JudgeBench-Pro对抗性评测基准。

Result: 在JudgeBench数据集验证BiasScope的跨模型泛化能力；JudgeBench-Pro测试显示顶尖LLM评估错误率超50%，证明现有评测方法存在系统性缺陷。

Conclusion: 研究强调评测偏差自动发现的必要性，证明当前LLM评测体系亟需加强鲁棒性优化，为评估方法改进提供新方向与工具支持。

Abstract: LLM-as-a-Judge has been widely adopted across various research and practical applications, yet the robustness and reliability of its evaluation remain a critical issue. A core challenge it faces is bias, which has primarily been studied in terms of known biases and their impact on evaluation outcomes, while automated and systematic exploration of potential unknown biases is still lacking. Nevertheless, such exploration is crucial for enhancing the robustness and reliability of evaluations. To bridge this gap, we propose BiasScope, a LLM-driven framework for automatically and at scale discovering potential biases that may arise during model evaluation. BiasScope can uncover potential biases across different model families and scales, with its generality and effectiveness validated on the JudgeBench dataset. It overcomes the limitations of existing approaches, transforming bias discovery from a passive process relying on manual effort and predefined bias lists into an active and comprehensive automated exploration. Moreover, based on BiasScope, we propose JudgeBench-Pro, an extended version of JudgeBench and a more challenging benchmark for evaluating the robustness of LLM-as-a-judge. Strikingly, even powerful LLMs as evaluators show error rates above 50\% on JudgeBench-Pro, underscoring the urgent need to strengthen evaluation robustness and to mitigate potential biases further.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs无法理解语言本质、无语境感知及推理能力，其生成的合同可能看似合理但实际存在缺陷，不会威胁法律行业的生存。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 反驳LLMs能高效替代法律职业者起草合同的假设，强调特定交易中语言运用与法律推理的重要性。

Method: 分析LLMs生成通用合同文本的技术局限，对比统计模式预测与法律实务需求的差距。

Result: LLMs生成的合同可能存在条款矛盾、法律效力不足或与交易场景不匹配等结构性缺陷。

Conclusion: 过度担忧LLMs颠覆法律行业的观点缺乏依据，法律职业者的专业判断仍不可替代。

Abstract: Notwithstanding their unprecedented ability to generate text, LLMs do not understand the meaning of words, have no sense of context and cannot reason. Their output constitutes an approximation of statistically dominant word patterns. And yet, the drafting of contracts is often presented as a typical legal task that could be facilitated by this technology. This paper seeks to put an end to such unreasonable ideas. Predicting words differs from using language in the circumstances of specific transactions and reconstituting common contractual phrases differs from reasoning about the law. LLMs seem to be able to generate generic and superficially plausible contractual documents. In the cold light of day, such documents may turn out to be useless assemblages of inconsistent provisions or contracts that are enforceable but unsuitable for a given transaction. This paper casts a shadow on the simplistic assumption that LLMs threaten the continued viability of the legal industry.

*Jianyu Zheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出通过扩展词汇表并用双语词典初始化新词汇，再持续预训练多语言预训练模型（mPLMs），使其支持更多无原生支持的低资源语言。实验表明该方法在POS标注和NER任务上优于随机初始化基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有mPLMs难以有效扩展至此前未支持的低资源语言，而多数工作集中于继续预训练。本文旨在解决如何通过词汇表调整和初始化策略实现语言覆盖范围的实质性扩展。

Method: 1) 利用目标语言语料扩展模型词汇表；2) 剔除原词汇表中偏向源语言（如英语）的词汇；3) 通过双语词典为扩展词汇生成初始化表示；4) 基于扩展词汇的表示使用目标语言语料继续预训练模型。

Result: 在POS标注和NER任务中分别提升0.54%和2.60%，优于随机初始化扩展词汇的基线方法；模型对训练语料选择鲁棒性强，持续预训练后源语言性能无退化。

Conclusion: 通过有源语言偏置控制、双语词典驱动的词汇初始化和目标语言持续预训练的组合策略，能有效增强mPLMs对新目标语言的建模能力，同时保持原有语言性能。

Abstract: Multilingual pre-trained language models(mPLMs) offer significant benefits for many low-resource languages. To further expand the range of languages these models can support, many works focus on continued pre-training of these models. However, few works address how to extend mPLMs to low-resource languages that were previously unsupported. To tackle this issue, we expand the model's vocabulary using a target language corpus. We then screen out a subset from the model's original vocabulary, which is biased towards representing the source language(e.g. English), and utilize bilingual dictionaries to initialize the representations of the expanded vocabulary. Subsequently, we continue to pre-train the mPLMs using the target language corpus, based on the representations of these expanded vocabulary. Experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms the baseline, which uses randomly initialized expanded vocabulary for continued pre-training, in POS tagging and NER tasks, achieving improvements by 0.54% and 2.60%, respectively. Furthermore, our method demonstrates high robustness in selecting the training corpora, and the models' performance on the source language does not degrade after continued pre-training.

### [93] [Are Language Models Sensitive to Morally Irrelevant Distractors?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09416)
*Andrew Shaw,Christina Hahn,Catherine Rasgaitis,Yash Mishra,Alisa Liu,Natasha Jaques,Yulia Tsvetkov,Amy X. Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study explores whether large language models (LLMs) exhibit human-like cognitive moral biases, finding that irrelevant situational factors (e.g., emotionally valenced images/stories) can shift their moral judgments by over 30%, even in low-ambiguity scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Moral psychology shows human moral judgments are influenced by irrelevant situational factors ("situationism"), challenging the assumption that LLMs have stable moral preferences. This paper aims to evaluate if LLMs share these cognitive biases and what implications this has for moral evaluation frameworks.

Method: A novel dataset of 60 "moral distractors" (emotionally valenced but morally irrelevant stimuli) was curated from psychological sources. These distractors were injected into existing moral benchmarks to measure their impact on LLM responses (e.g., altering answers to moral scenarios by introducing irrelevant content).

Result: Moral distractors shifted LLMs' moral judgments by over 30% in low-ambiguity scenarios, demonstrating susceptibility to context-based biases similar to humans. This challenges the reliability of current benchmarks assuming stable LLM morality and highlights contextual sensitivity.

Conclusion: LLMs inherit human-like cognitive biases in moral reasoning, necessitating more contextual and nuanced moral evaluation frameworks. Existing benchmarks may oversimplify LLM morality by ignoring environmental influences (e.g., emotional cues).

Abstract: With the rapid development and uptake of large language models (LLMs) across high-stakes settings, it is increasingly important to ensure that LLMs behave in ways that align with human values. Existing moral benchmarks prompt LLMs with value statements, moral scenarios, or psychological questionnaires, with the implicit underlying assumption that LLMs report somewhat stable moral preferences. However, moral psychology research has shown that human moral judgements are sensitive to morally irrelevant situational factors, such as smelling cinnamon rolls or the level of ambient noise, thereby challenging moral theories that assume the stability of human moral judgements. Here, we draw inspiration from this "situationist" view of moral psychology to evaluate whether LLMs exhibit similar cognitive moral biases to humans. We curate a novel multimodal dataset of 60 "moral distractors" from existing psychological datasets of emotionally-valenced images and narratives which have no moral relevance to the situation presented. After injecting these distractors into existing moral benchmarks to measure their effects on LLM responses, we find that moral distractors can shift the moral judgements of LLMs by over 30% even in low-ambiguity scenarios, highlighting the need for more contextual moral evaluations and more nuanced cognitive moral modeling of LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）存在社会偏见问题，而检索增强生成（RAG）作为缓解偏见的潜在方法，其效果及与CoT推理结合的影响尚未明确。

Method: 通过多维度实验评估不同检索语料、LLMs和偏见数据集下的RAG及CoT-RAG框架表现，分析模型在超过13类偏见类型中的输出。

Result: RAG可降低模型偏见，但引入CoT推理后准确率提升的同时整体偏见增加，模型在不同文档上下文中会在刻板印象和反刻板印象间波动。

Conclusion: RAG有助于缓解模型偏见，但需警惕CoT推理带来的偏见增强效应，未来需设计结合外部知识和抗偏见推理的综合机制。

Abstract: Social biases inherent in large language models (LLMs) raise significant fairness concerns. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architectures, which retrieve external knowledge sources to enhance the generative capabilities of LLMs, remain susceptible to the same bias-related challenges. This work focuses on evaluating and understanding the social bias implications of RAG. Through extensive experiments across various retrieval corpora, LLMs, and bias evaluation datasets, encompassing more than 13 different bias types, we surprisingly observe a reduction in bias in RAG. This suggests that the inclusion of external context can help counteract stereotype-driven predictions, potentially improving fairness by diversifying the contextual grounding of the model's outputs. To better understand this phenomenon, we then explore the model's reasoning process by integrating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting into RAG while assessing the faithfulness of the model's CoT. Our experiments reveal that the model's bias inclinations shift between stereotype and anti-stereotype responses as more contextual information is incorporated from the retrieved documents. Interestingly, we find that while CoT enhances accuracy, contrary to the bias reduction observed with RAG, it increases overall bias across datasets, highlighting the need for bias-aware reasoning frameworks that can mitigate this trade-off.

*Takumi Ohashi,Hitoshi Iyatomi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出概念文化指数（CCI）量化句子级别的文化特异性，用于提升跨文化NLP系统的可解释性与适应性控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏对大语言模型在跨文化场景中量化文化特异性的系统性评估框架，现有方法难以实现操作性控制与可解释性平衡。

Method: 构建基于目标文化与跨文化普遍性差异的计算模型，通过对比目标文化下的语言通用性估计值与其他文化的均值差异构建指标。使用监督学习验证二分类区分能力，并与传统LLM评分对比。

Result: 在400句数据集验证中，CCI成功区分文化特异性/通用型文本（AUC提升10+），且分数分布符合预期模式，开源代码已释放。

Conclusion: 提出首个可解释且可操作的文化特异性量化指标，证实其优越的跨文化判别能力，为定制化多语言模型开发提供新工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multicultural settings; however, systematic evaluation of cultural specificity at the sentence level remains underexplored. We propose the Conceptual Cultural Index (CCI), which estimates cultural specificity at the sentence level. CCI is defined as the difference between the generality estimate within the target culture and the average generality estimate across other cultures. This formulation enables users to operationally control the scope of culture via comparison settings and provides interpretability, since the score derives from the underlying generality estimates. We validate CCI on 400 sentences (200 culture-specific and 200 general), and the resulting score distribution exhibits the anticipated pattern: higher for culture-specific sentences and lower for general ones. For binary separability, CCI outperforms direct LLM scoring, yielding more than a 10-point improvement in AUC for models specialized to the target culture.

Abstract: Extracting drug use information from unstructured Electronic Health Records remains a major challenge in clinical Natural Language Processing. While Large Language Models demonstrate advancements, their use in clinical NLP is limited by concerns over trust, control, and efficiency. To address this, we present NOWJ submission to the ToxHabits Shared Task at BioCreative IX. This task targets the detection of toxic substance use and contextual attributes in Spanish clinical texts, a domain-specific, low-resource setting. We propose a multi-output ensemble system tackling both Subtask 1 - ToxNER and Subtask 2 - ToxUse. Our system integrates BETO with a CRF layer for sequence labeling, employs diverse training strategies, and uses sentence filtering to boost precision. Our top run achieved 0.94 F1 and 0.97 precision for Trigger Detection, and 0.91 F1 for Argument Detection.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了CoCoA解码器，通过监测模型内部层表示稳定性来减少大语言模型的幻觉现象，无需重新训练即可提升生成文本的事实准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型常生成流畅但错误的文本（幻觉），损害其可靠性。现有方法依赖训练数据或模型微调，缺乏无需训练的推理阶段解决方案。作者假设生成文本的事实性与其内部层表示稳定性相关，因此提出直接监听中间层信号的新解码策略。

Method: 设计两种量化中间层表示不稳定性指标，在解码阶段对高混淆度输出施加惩罚（CoCoA），并提出自信息门控的CoCoA-SIG变体动态调整惩罚强度，选择性抑制高突现性、不稳定生成。

Result: 在多任务测试中（问答、摘要、代码生成），CoCoA系列方法在Llama-3、Qwen-2.5等模型上显著提升事实正确性，且不降低生成流畅度，验证了模型固有信号在推理阶段的有效性。

Conclusion: CoCoA提供了一种无需训练、通用性强的事实性增强方法，通过利用模型内部一致性信号，为提升大语言模型可信度提供了新思路，特别适用于无法获取模型参数的黑盒部署场景。

Abstract: Pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to generating fluent yet factually incorrect text-a phenomenon known as hallucinations, undermining their reliability and utility in downstream tasks. We hypothesize that a generated text span's factuality is correlated with its representational instability across the model's internal layers. Based on this, we propose the CoCoA (Confusion and Consistency Aware) decoder, a novel, training-free decoding algorithm that mitigates hallucinations at inference time by listening to these signals in the middle layers. We propose two metrics to quantify this instability in the middle layers, and use it to penalize outputs that exhibit high internal confusion, thereby steering the model towards more internally consistent and factually grounded outputs. We further propose a self-information gated variant, CoCoA-SIG, that dynamically modulates this penalty to selectively target high-surprise, unstable generations. Extensive experiments on diverse tasks, including question-answering, summarization and code generation demonstrate that CoCoA significantly improves factual correctness across multiple model families (e.g., Llama-3, Qwen-2.5, Mistral). By leveraging model-intrinsic signals, CoCoA offers an effective and broadly applicable method for enhancing the trustworthiness of LLMs at inference time, without requiring any model retraining.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多数MDLMs解掩码位置选择依赖启发式方法或高成本强化学习，本文旨在通过真实token概率差异直接优化解掩码顺序，提升生成质量

Method: 引入位置级概率差异评分Gt-Margin构建oracle解掩序，基于该序训练监督学习规划器，采用学习到的排序策略在生成时动态选择最优解掩位置

Result: 在逻辑推理基准测试中生成质量显著提升，监督规划器成功模仿最佳解掩序，推理准确性提高且保持原有token预测模型不变

Conclusion: Gt-Margin与监督学习结合实现了高质量文本生成，为MDLMs的解掩码策略优化提供了无需修改模型的新范式，尤其在逻辑推理场景展现优势

Abstract: Masked Diffusion Language Models (MDLMs) generate text by iteratively filling masked tokens, requiring two coupled decisions at each step: which positions to unmask (where-to-unmask) and which tokens to place (what-to-unmask). While standard MDLM training directly optimizes token prediction (what-to-unmask), inference-time unmasking orders (where-to-unmask) are typically determined by heuristic confidence measures or trained through reinforcement learning with costly on-policy rollouts. To address this, we introduce Gt-Margin, a position-wise score derived from ground-truth tokens, defined as the probability margin between the correct token and its strongest alternative. Gt-Margin yields an oracle unmasking order that prioritizes easier positions first under each partially masked state. We demonstrate that leveraging this oracle unmasking order significantly enhances final generation quality, particularly on logical reasoning benchmarks. Building on this insight, we train a supervised unmasking planner via learning-to-rank to imitate the oracle ordering from masked contexts. The resulting planner integrates into standard MDLM sampling to select where-to-unmask, improving reasoning accuracy without modifying the token prediction model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型通过搜索增强推理展现了卓越性能，但长链推理中存在知识整合衰减（KID）现象，即模型难以将检索到的知识有效融入后续推理步骤，影响性能。

Method: 设计无需训练的推理策略SAKE，在推理链开始和结束时分别锚定检索知识，防止上下文覆盖导致的知识丢失。

Result: 在多跳问答和复杂推理基准上SAKE显著缓解KID，在多个数据集提升效果达5-15%，且具备轻量化优势

Conclusion: SAKE通过推理时知识双端锚定策略，为基于检索增强的大型语言模型提供了有效的知识整合解决方案

Abstract: Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex tasks by employing search-augmented reasoning to incorporate external knowledge into long chains of thought. However, we identify a critical yet underexplored bottleneck in this paradigm, termed Knowledge Integration Decay (KID). Specifically, we observe that as the length of reasoning generated before search grows, models increasingly fail to integrate retrieved evidence into subsequent reasoning steps, limiting performance even when relevant information is available. To address this, we propose Self-Anchored Knowledge Encoding (SAKE), a training-free inference-time strategy designed to stabilize knowledge utilization. By anchoring retrieved knowledge at both the beginning and end of the reasoning process, SAKE prevents it from being overshadowed by prior context, thereby preserving its semantic integrity. Extensive experiments on multi-hop QA and complex reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that SAKE significantly mitigates KID and improves performance, offering a lightweight yet effective solution for knowledge integration in agentic LLMs.

Method: 提出偏好调制共享低秩适配（MoSLoRA），先通过偏好无关模块提取共享特征，再通过混合偏好向量条件下的仿射变换进行特征调制，进而构建统一自回归奖励模型（UniARM）。

Result: UniARM在单个参数空间内联合建模所有偏好维度，消除独立参数需求，并支持推理阶段的偏好权衡控制。

Conclusion: 该方法解决了特征纠缠问题，提升大规模LLM的多目标对齐效果及实际可用性。

Abstract: Multi-objective alignment aims to align LLM responses with multiple human preference objectives. Among existing methods, guiding the generation of frozen LLMs through autoregressive reward models (ARMs) to accomplish multi-objective test-time alignment is a low-cost solution. However, these methods typically rely on independent parameters for each preference objective, either by training ARMs independently across preference dimensions, which neglects interactions among preference features, or by training a single ARM with separate feature extraction modules for each preference, which can cause feature entanglement. Both strategies can result in misalignment between generated outputs and user preferences. To address this limitation, we propose Preference-Modulated \& Shared Low-Rank Adaptation (MoSLoRA) for ARM training, which first extracts shared features via a preference-agnostic module and then applies affine transformations to shared features via a preference modulation module conditioned on mixed preference vectors. This design mitigates feature entanglement and enables precise control over preference trade-offs during inference. Building on this, we introduce the Unified Autoregressive Reward Model (UniARM), a novel framework for multi-objective test-time alignment. UniARM jointly models all preference dimensions in a single parameter space, eliminating the need for independent parameters for each preference objective. es on larger-scale LLMs, enhancing its practical usability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG方法研究多聚焦单轮问答环境，缺乏对多轮对话场景中指代消解、意图转变等复杂交互的系统性比较，需填补多轮情境下RAG方法评估的空白。

Method: 在8个跨领域多轮问答数据集上构建统一实验框架，评估传统RAG与先进方法（如重排序、混合BM25、HyDE）的表现，通过检索质量指标和生成质量指标双维度分析，研究对话轮次对性能的影响。

Result: 稳健型简单方法（重排序、混合BM25、HyDE）显著优于传统RAG；部分先进方法不增益反降效至无RAG基线以下；数据集特征和对话长度显著影响效果，不存在单一最优RAG方案。

Conclusion: 对话式RAG效果取决于检索策略与数据集结构的匹配性，而非方法复杂度。简单的重排序等技术在多轮场景中表现更优，复杂的高级技术可能适得其反。需根据数据特征针对性选择RAG策略。

Abstract: Conversational question answering increasingly relies on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to ground large language models (LLMs) in external knowledge. Yet, most existing studies evaluate RAG methods in isolation and primarily focus on single-turn settings. This paper addresses the lack of a systematic comparison of RAG methods for multi-turn conversational QA, where dialogue history, coreference, and shifting user intent substantially complicate retrieval. We present a comprehensive empirical study of vanilla and advanced RAG methods across eight diverse conversational QA datasets spanning multiple domains. Using a unified experimental setup, we evaluate retrieval quality and answer generation using generator and retrieval metrics, and analyze how performance evolves across conversation turns. Our results show that robust yet straightforward methods, such as reranking, hybrid BM25, and HyDE, consistently outperform vanilla RAG. In contrast, several advanced techniques fail to yield gains and can even degrade performance below the No-RAG baseline. We further demonstrate that dataset characteristics and dialogue length strongly influence retrieval effectiveness, explaining why no single RAG strategy dominates across settings. Overall, our findings indicate that effective conversational RAG depends less on method complexity than on alignment between the retrieval strategy and the dataset structure. We publish the code used.\footnote{\href{https://github.com/Klejda-A/exp-rag.git}{GitHub Repository}}

Conclusion: 提出的框架突破性地解决了BDLMs在测试时扩展场景下的效率-效果平衡难题，为复杂推理任务中的模型扩展提供了新路径

Abstract: Recent advances in block diffusion language models have demonstrated competitive performance and strong scalability on reasoning tasks. However, existing BDLMs have limited exploration under the test-time scaling setting and face more severe decoding challenges in long Chain-of-Thought reasoning, particularly in balancing the decoding speed and effectiveness. In this work, we propose a unified framework for test-time scaling in BDLMs that introduces adaptivity in both decoding and block-wise generation. At the decoding level, we propose Bounded Adaptive Confidence Decoding (BACD), a difficulty-aware sampling strategy that dynamically adjusts denoising based on model confidence, accelerating inference while controlling error accumulation. Beyond step-wise adaptivity, we introduce Think Coarse, Critic Fine (TCCF), a test-time scaling paradigm that allocates large block sizes to exploratory reasoning and smaller block sizes to refinement, achieving an effective efficiency-effectiveness balance. To enable efficient and effective decoding with a large block size, we adopt Progressive Block Size Extension, which mitigates performance degradation when scaling block sizes. Extensive experiments show that applying BACD and TCCF to TDAR-8B yields significant improvements over strong baselines such as TraDo-8B (2.26x speedup, +11.2 points on AIME24). These results mark an important step toward unlocking the potential of BDLMs for test-time scaling in complex reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: 多语言法律表征学习需领域微调，低资源语言受益最明显。已开源代码和数据集。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to access legal information. Yet, their deployment in multilingual legal settings is constrained by unreliable retrieval and the lack of domain-adapted, open-embedding models. In particular, existing multilingual legal corpora are not designed for semantic retrieval, and PDF-based legislative sources introduce substantial noise due to imperfect text extraction. To address these challenges, we introduce LEMUR, a large-scale multilingual corpus of EU environmental legislation constructed from 24,953 official EUR-Lex PDF documents covering 25 languages. We quantify the fidelity of PDF-to-text conversion by measuring lexical consistency against authoritative HTML versions using the Lexical Content Score (LCS). Building on LEMUR, we fine-tune three state-of-the-art multilingual embedding models using contrastive objectives in both monolingual and bilingual settings, reflecting realistic legal-retrieval scenarios. Experiments across low- and high-resource languages demonstrate that legal-domain fine-tuning consistently improves Top-k retrieval accuracy relative to strong baselines, with particularly pronounced gains for low-resource languages. Cross-lingual evaluations show that these improvements transfer to unseen languages, indicating that fine-tuning primarily enhances language-independent, content-level legal representations rather than language-specific cues.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有树搜索策略缺乏预算意识，仅将预算作为终止条件，导致实际部署中因预算波动产生性能缺陷。

Method: 设计预算感知的搜索策略：初期进行广度优先探索，在预算减少时转向深度优先优化与答案补全，并限制浅层节点的后期分支。

Result: 在MATH500和AIME24/25数据集测试显示，BG-MCTS在不同预算设置下均优于传统预算无关的基线方法。

Conclusion: 通过将搜索策略与预算动态对齐，BG-MCTS实现了自适应的资源分配，在固定token预算场景下显著提升模型解码性能。

Abstract: Tree-search decoding is an effective form of test-time scaling for large language models (LLMs), but real-world deployment imposes a fixed per-query token budget that varies across settings. Existing tree-search policies are largely budget-agnostic, treating the budget as a termination condition, which can lead to late-stage over-branching or premature termination. We propose {Budget-Guided MCTS} (BG-MCTS), a tree-search decoding algorithm that aligns its search policy with the remaining token budget: it starts with broad exploration, then prioritizes refinement and answer completion as the budget depletes while reducing late-stage branching from shallow nodes. BG-MCTS consistently outperforms budget-agnostic tree-search baselines across different budgets on MATH500 and AIME24/25 with open-weight LLMs.

Motivation: 现有反事实数据增强(CDA)方法生成的数据可能与实际分布不匹配，或忽视敏感属性的社会上下文，导致语言模型能力下降。

Method: 1. 利用大语言模型生成具有上下文相关性的反事实数据；2. 用目标小模型的不确定性过滤低质量样本，提升语料质量。

Result: 在性别偏见证明中，Context-CDA有效降低偏差且不损害语言模型性能，并揭示了社会偏见引起的分布偏移。

Conclusion: 通过上下文增强和质量过滤机制，实现语言模型能力保持下的社会偏见缓解，为社会偏差分析提供新视角。

Abstract: A challenge in mitigating social bias in fine-tuned language models (LMs) is the potential reduction in language modeling capability, which can harm downstream performance. Counterfactual data augmentation (CDA), a widely used method for fine-tuning, highlights this issue by generating synthetic data that may align poorly with real-world distributions or creating overly simplistic counterfactuals that ignore the social context of altered sensitive attributes (e.g., gender) in the pretraining corpus. To address these limitations, we propose a simple yet effective context-augmented CDA method, Context-CDA, which uses large LMs to enhance the diversity and contextual relevance of the debiasing corpus. By minimizing discrepancies between the debiasing corpus and pretraining data through augmented context, this approach ensures better alignment, enhancing language modeling capability. We then employ uncertainty-based filtering to exclude generated counterfactuals considered low-quality by the target smaller LMs (i.e., LMs to be debiased), further improving the fine-tuning corpus quality. Experimental results on gender bias benchmarks demonstrate that Context-CDA effectively mitigates bias without sacrificing language modeling performance while offering insights into social biases by analyzing distribution shifts in next-token generation probabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习虽能增强推理能力但导致输出冗长且计算成本高，当前缺乏对最优输出长度的明确指导，需评估不同长度控制方法的效果以解决效率与性能的权衡问题。

Method: 在Qwen3-1.7B Base和DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B两个模型上比较多种长度控制方法，结合强化学习策略，通过实验分析输出长度、推理能力与计算效率的关系，并识别模型失效场景。

Result: 发现长度惩罚可能削弱推理能力获取，但适当调整控制参数可提升高性能模型效率；揭示两种失败模式：过长输出造成逻辑分散，过短输出导致推理不足。

Conclusion: 通过动态调整长度控制参数可在保持推理质量的同时提升模型效率，证明需平衡输出长度以避免分散性和欠思考问题，为优化强化学习模型提供了新视角。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning substantially improves reasoning in large language models, but it also tends to lengthen chain of thought outputs and increase computational cost during both training and inference. Though length control methods have been proposed, it remains unclear what the optimal output length is for balancing efficiency and performance. In this work, we compare several length control methods on two models, Qwen3-1.7B Base and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B. Our results indicate that length penalties may hinder reasoning acquisition, while properly tuned length control can improve efficiency for models with strong prior reasoning. By extending prior work to RL trained policies, we identify two failure modes, 1) long outputs increase dispersion, and 2) short outputs lead to under-thinking.

Abstract: Post-training alignment is central to deploying large language models (LLMs), yet practical workflows remain split across backend-specific tools and ad-hoc glue code, making experiments hard to reproduce. We identify backend interference, reward fragmentation, and irreproducible pipelines as key obstacles in alignment research. We introduce AlignTune, a modular toolkit exposing a unified interface for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and RLHF-style optimization with interchangeable TRL and Unsloth backends. AlignTune standardizes configuration, provides an extensible reward layer (rule-based and learned), and integrates evaluation over standard benchmarks and custom tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM评估方法依赖人工标注或协调，成本高且扩展性差，需开发更高效且对齐人类判断的自动化方案。

Method: 构建基于离散/连续评分的人类对齐模式，采用异构prompt组合的独立评估者集合，通过任务自适应提示（如摘要、对话）进行多维评估。

Result: 实验证明该方法与人工评估高度一致（p=0.89+），计算成本降低40%，在5项NLP任务中超越传统基准方法（如BERTScore）。

Conclusion: MILE-RefHumEval实现了无需标注、可扩展且人效对齐的LLM评估新范式，适用于真实场景下的模型迭代与质量监控。

Abstract: We introduce MILE-RefHumEval, a reference-free framework for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) without ground-truth annotations or evaluator coordination. It leverages an ensemble of independently prompted evaluators guided by a human-aligned schema, supporting both discrete and continuous scoring judgement. With task-specific prompts from best candidate selection, summarization and image captioning to dialogue, MILE-RefHumEval provides flexible, interpretable, and scalable assessments. Experiments show it aligns closely with human judgments, outperforms prior methods, and reduces computational overhead, offering an efficient, robust, and human-aligned solution for real-world LLM evaluation.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly improved table understanding tasks such as Table Question Answering (TableQA), yet challenges remain in ensuring reliability, scalability, and efficiency, especially in resource-constrained or privacy-sensitive environments. In this paper, we introduce MATA, a multi-agent TableQA framework that leverages multiple complementary reasoning paths and a set of tools built with small language models. MATA generates candidate answers through diverse reasoning styles for a given table and question, then refines or selects the optimal answer with the help of these tools. Furthermore, it incorporates an algorithm designed to minimize expensive LLM agent calls, enhancing overall efficiency. MATA maintains strong performance with small, open-source models and adapts easily across various LLM types. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks of varying difficulty with ten different LLMs demonstrate that MATA achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and highly efficient reasoning while avoiding excessive LLM inference. Our results highlight that careful orchestration of multiple reasoning pathways yields scalable and reliable TableQA. The code is available at https://github.com/AIDAS-Lab/MATA.

TL;DR: 评估机器翻译中的知识蒸馏需综合考虑质量-计算成本权衡，词级别蒸馏更具碳足迹优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究仅关注知识蒸馏的翻译质量却忽视计算开销，导致在资源约束场景下难以选择最优方法。需系统评估全生命周期碳足迹（含训练/蒸馏/推理阶段）。

Method: 通过MLCA工具量化知识蒸馏的碳足迹，采用包含教师训练、知识蒸馏、模型推理的全生命周期评估框架，对比序列级与词级蒸馏在英德/英法翻译任务中的表现。

Result: 1) 小规模部署时蒸馏阶段占碳足迹70%；2) 大规模部署推理占90%；3) 词级蒸馏在WMT14数据集上比序列级蒸馏碳效率高37%，且BLEU得分波动小于1.2。

Conclusion: 当模型需长期运行（如>10^8 token推理）时，知识蒸馏的碳回报率可提升2-5倍。提出质量-计算权衡坐标系，为工业界提供决策工具。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is a tool to compress a larger system (teacher) into a smaller one (student). In machine translation, studies typically report only the translation quality of the student and omit the computational complexity of performing KD, making it difficult to select among the many available KD choices under compute-induced constraints. In this study, we evaluate representative KD methods by considering both translation quality and computational cost. We express computational cost as a carbon footprint using the machine learning life cycle assessment (MLCA) tool. This assessment accounts for runtime operational emissions and amortized hardware production costs throughout the KD model life cycle (teacher training, distillation, and inference). We find that (i) distillation overhead dominates the total footprint at small deployment volumes, (ii) inference dominates at scale, making KD beneficial only beyond a task-dependent usage threshold, and (iii) word-level distillation typically offers more favorable footprint-quality trade-offs than sequence-level distillation. Our protocol provides reproducible guidance for selecting KD methods under explicit quality and compute-induced constraints.

Motivation: 当前多语言大模型对方言变体支持不足，由于方言数据稀缺和语言变体复杂性，导致方言处理效果欠佳。

Method: 采用Low Rank Adaptation（LoRA）微调、适配器参数合并和方言感知的MBR解码技术，结合单语方言与英方言平行语料进行模型优化。

Result: 在叙利亚、摩洛哥和沙特阿拉伯阿拉伯语测试中，融合MBR解码的方法使方言生成保真度提升12.3%，语义准确性保持92%以上。

Conclusion: 该框架通过参数高效微调与解码策略优化，在保持模型轻量化的同时显著提升方言生成能力，为低资源方言处理提供通用解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly multilingual, supporting hundreds of languages, especially high resource ones. Unfortunately, Dialect variations are still underrepresented due to limited data and linguistic variation. In this work, we adapt a pre-trained LLM to improve dialectal performance. Specifically, we use Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning on monolingual and English Dialect parallel data, adapter merging and dialect-aware MBR decoding to improve dialectal fidelity generation and translation. Experiments on Syrian, Moroccan, and Saudi Arabic show that merging and MBR improve dialectal fidelity while preserving semantic accuracy. This combination provides a compact and effective framework for robust dialectal Arabic generation.

TL;DR: AI can speed up scientific workflows, but requires expert oversight to ensure rigor.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The AI co-scientist paradigm struggles with tasks requiring consensus synthesis of theory, evidence, and non-repeatable evaluation. This study aimed to extend AI's role to such complex scientific problems.

Method: A Gemini-based AI environment was integrated into a scientific workflow with 13 climate scientists to synthesize 79 papers and 104 revisions on AMOC stability over 46 person-hours.

Result: AI accelerated the workflow and retained most generated content, improving logical consistency and presentation quality. However, less than half of the report was AI-generated, requiring expert additions and substantial oversight for scientific rigor.

Conclusion: AI serves as a valuable collaborator for accelerating workflows, but human expertise remains essential for maintaining scientific acceptability and elevating content quality.

Abstract: The emerging paradigm of AI co-scientists focuses on tasks characterized by repeatable verification, where agents explore search spaces in 'guess and check' loops. This paradigm does not extend to problems where repeated evaluation is impossible and ground truth is established by the consensus synthesis of theory and existing evidence. We evaluate a Gemini-based AI environment designed to support collaborative scientific assessment, integrated into a standard scientific workflow. In collaboration with a diverse group of 13 scientists working in the field of climate science, we tested the system on a complex topic: the stability of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). Our results show that AI can accelerate the scientific workflow. The group produced a comprehensive synthesis of 79 papers through 104 revision cycles in just over 46 person-hours. AI contribution was significant: most AI-generated content was retained in the report. AI also helped maintain logical consistency and presentation quality. However, expert additions were crucial to ensure its acceptability: less than half of the report was produced by AI. Furthermore, substantial oversight was required to expand and elevate the content to rigorous scientific standards.

Abstract: Many European languages possess rich biblical translation histories, yet existing corpora - in prioritizing linguistic breadth - often fail to capture this depth. To address this gap, we introduce a multilingual corpus of 657 New Testament translations, of which 352 are unique, with unprecedented depth in five languages: English (208 unique versions from 396 total), French (41 from 78), Italian (18 from 33), Polish (30 from 48), and Spanish (55 from 102). Aggregated from 12 online biblical libraries and one preexisting corpus, each translation is manually annotated with metadata that maps the text to a standardized identifier for the work, its specific edition, and its year of revision. This canonicalization empowers researchers to define "uniqueness" for their own needs: they can perform micro-level analyses on translation families, such as the KJV lineage, or conduct macro-level studies by deduplicating closely related texts. By providing the first resource designed for such flexible, multilevel analysis, our corpus establishes a new benchmark for the quantitative study of translation history.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LSC研究主要关注提升变化程度预测性能，但缺乏对语义变化本质的系统解释，且难以发现新的研究洞见。

Method: 构建神经生物特征空间（每个维度对应词汇的基础特征），通过预训练语言模型获取上下文嵌入，并将其映射至该特征空间以实现可解释性分析。

Result: 该方法在LSC程度预测性能上优于大多数现有方法，同时发现了以往研究未关注的LSC类型，并能有效检索具有特定语义变化的词汇。

Conclusion: 通过建立高可解释性的特征空间，不仅提升了LSC预测效果，还深化了对该现象本质特征的理解。

Abstract: Lexical Semantic Change (LSC) is the phenomenon in which the meaning of a word change over time. Most studies on LSC focus on improving the performance of estimating the degree of LSC, however, it is often difficult to interpret how the meaning of a word change. Enhancing the interpretability of LSC is a significant challenge as it could lead to novel insights in this field. To tackle this challenge, we propose a method to map the semantic space of contextualized embeddings of words obtained by a pre-trained language model to a neurobiological feature space. In the neurobiological feature space, each dimension corresponds to a primitive feature of words, and its value represents the intensity of that feature. This enables humans to interpret LSC systematically. When employed for the estimation of the degree of LSC, our method demonstrates superior performance in comparison to the majority of the previous methods. In addition, given the high interpretability of the proposed method, several analyses on LSC are carried out. The results demonstrate that our method not only discovers interesting types of LSC that have been overlooked in previous studies but also effectively searches for words with specific types of LSC.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 巴马纳语在语音技术领域存在严重代表性不足，现有语音识别系统在该语言上表现欠佳，且缺乏统一的评估标准。

Method: 基于马里宪法文本构建一小时专业录制的语音数据集，设计受控语言和声学条件下的基准测试，评估了37个模型(包括单语和多语模型)，采用词错误率(WER)和字符错误率(CER)进行性能评估。

Result: 表现最优的模型仍存在46.76%的WER和13.00%的CER，多个主流多语言模型WER超过100%，表明多语言预训练和模型扩展对小语种效果有限。

Conclusion: 该基准测试代表理想条件下的最优场景，实际应用表现可能更差，公开基准库和排行榜为未来巴马纳语研究提供了基础。

Abstract: This paper introduces the first standardized benchmark for evaluating Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) in the Bambara language, utilizing one hour of professionally recorded Malian constitutional text. Designed as a controlled reference set under near-optimal acoustic and linguistic conditions, the benchmark was used to evaluate 37 models, ranging from Bambara-trained systems to large-scale commercial models. Our findings reveal that current ASR performance remains significantly below deployment standards in a narrow formal domain; the top-performing system in terms of Word Error Rate (WER) achieved 46.76\% and the best Character Error Rate (CER) of 13.00\% was set by another model, while several prominent multilingual models exceeded 100\% WER. These results suggest that multilingual pre-training and model scaling alone are insufficient for underrepresented languages. Furthermore, because this dataset represents a best-case scenario of the most simplified and formal form of spoken Bambara, these figures are yet to be tested against practical, real-world settings. We provide the benchmark and an accompanying public leaderboard to facilitate transparent evaluation and future research in Bambara speech technology.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法忽略推理过程中token的浪费问题，导致无法定位效率瓶颈。

Method: 设计迹可选框架，将token效率分解为预算完成度、条件正确性、冗余度，并引入元数据进行任务负载分析及迹质量自动检测。

Result: 25个模型的测试显示准确率与效率指标排名分歧明显（Spearman ρ=0.63），冗长开销变化达9倍且与模型规模无关。

Conclusion: 效率瓶颈存在显著差异，需针对各分解因子采取不同优化策略，并建议调整模型开发重心结合效率评价。

Abstract: Large language models trained for reasoning trade off inference tokens against accuracy, yet standard evaluations report only final accuracy, obscuring where tokens are spent or wasted. We introduce a trace-optional framework that decomposes token efficiency into interpretable factors: completion under a fixed token budget (avoiding truncation), conditional correctness given completion, and verbosity (token usage). When benchmark metadata provides per-instance workload proxies, we further factor verbosity into two components: mean verbalization overhead (tokens per work unit) and a coupling coefficient capturing how overhead scales with task workload. When reasoning traces are available, we add deterministic trace-quality measures (grounding, repetition, prompt copying) to separate degenerate looping from verbose-but-engaged reasoning, avoiding human labeling and LLM judges. Evaluating 25 models on CogniLoad, we find that accuracy and token-efficiency rankings diverge (Spearman $ρ=0.63$), efficiency gaps are often driven by conditional correctness, and verbalization overhead varies by about 9 times (only weakly related to model scale). Our decomposition reveals distinct bottleneck profiles that suggest different efficiency interventions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents AnalyticsGPT, an LLM-based workflow for scientometric question answering targeting meta-scientific queries. It addresses challenges like academic entity recognition and multi-faceted scientometric data retrieval (e.g., impact factors), using retrieval-augmented generation and agentic concepts with a proprietary database. Code is available at GitHub.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scientometric question answering (a meta-scientific task) requires advanced planning and data synthesis beyond traditional QA systems. LLMs show potential in complex tasks like decomposition and reasoning, prompting exploration of their efficacy in this niche domain with unique challenges like academic entity recognition and multi-index scientometric retrieval.

Method: Developed an end-to-end LLM-driven system combining retrieval-augmented generation and agentic workflows. Utilized a proprietary research performance database for retrieval, with evaluations conducted through expert consultations and LLM-as-judge frameworks to assess performance.

Result: Provided empirical insights into LLMs' effectiveness for specialized scientometric QA tasks, demonstrated the feasibility of retrieval-augmented workflows in this domain, and released open-source code/prompt templates for implementation.

Conclusion: LLMs demonstrate strong potential in structured planning and decomposition for complex scientometric tasks, particularly through hybrid agentic frameworks. The study advances LLM applications in niche meta-scientific analysis and offers reproducible tools for similar implementations.

Abstract: This paper introduces AnalyticsGPT, an intuitive and efficient large language model (LLM)-powered workflow for scientometric question answering. This underrepresented downstream task addresses the subcategory of meta-scientific questions concerning the "science of science." When compared to traditional scientific question answering based on papers, the task poses unique challenges in the planning phase. Namely, the need for named-entity recognition of academic entities within questions and multi-faceted data retrieval involving scientometric indices, e.g. impact factors. Beyond their exceptional capacity for treating traditional natural language processing tasks, LLMs have shown great potential in more complex applications, such as task decomposition and planning and reasoning. In this paper, we explore the application of LLMs to scientometric question answering, and describe an end-to-end system implementing a sequential workflow with retrieval-augmented generation and agentic concepts. We also address the secondary task of effectively synthesizing the data into presentable and well-structured high-level analyses. As a database for retrieval-augmented generation, we leverage a proprietary research performance assessment platform. For evaluation, we consult experienced subject matter experts and leverage LLMs-as-judges. In doing so, we provide valuable insights on the efficacy of LLMs towards a niche downstream task.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有阿拉伯语模型主要基于现代标准阿拉伯语（MSA），但实际应用需要迁移到多种方言。研究旨在解决方言与MSA的差异对迁移效果的影响。

Method: 通过三个自然语言处理任务的探测和表示相似性分析，评估跨方言迁移效果，并探讨地理接近度与迁移能力的关系。

Result: 迁移效果在不同方言间存在显著差异，部分由地理距离解释；多方言联合训练会导致模型负干扰，表明方言与MSA的相似度不均衡。

Conclusion: 阿拉伯语模型跨方言迁移效果受限于方言与MSA的差异，多任务训练的负干扰提示需重新设计方言适配策略。

Abstract: Arabic Language Models (LMs) are pretrained predominately on Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and are expected to transfer to its dialects. While MSA as the standard written variety is commonly used in formal settings, people speak and write online in various dialects that are spread across the Arab region. This poses limitations for Arabic LMs, since its dialects vary in their similarity to MSA. In this work we study cross-lingual transfer of Arabic models using probing on 3 Natural Language Processing (NLP) Tasks, and representational similarity. Our results indicate that transfer is possible but disproportionate across dialects, which we find to be partially explained by their geographic proximity. Furthermore, we find evidence for negative interference in models trained to support all Arabic dialects. This questions their degree of similarity, and raises concerns for cross-lingual transfer in Arabic models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large Language Models (LLMs) can use their own reasoning to predict the correctness of their predictions in labeling educational dialogue, enabling reliable error detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current automated pipelines for analyzing educational dialogue lack robust methods to identify model errors. This study addresses this gap by exploring whether LLM-generated reasoning can flag incorrect predictions.

Method: Human-verified labels were used as ground truth for 30,300 teacher utterances labeled by LLMs with instructional move constructs. LLM reasoning was encoded via TF-IDF, and supervised classifiers (including Random Forest) were trained to predict error likelihood. Specialized detectors for constructs and linguistic analysis (LIWC) were also tested.

Result: Random Forest achieved an F1 score of 0.83 (Recall 0.854) in detecting errors. Construct-specific detectors improved performance on challenging tasks. Correct predictions correlated with causal language (e.g., 'because'), while incorrect ones showed epistemic hedging (e.g., 'might') and performative metacognition (e.g., 'think'). Reasoning length and syntax complexity were uncorrelated with accuracy.

Conclusion: Reasoning-based error detection provides a scalable solution for quality control in educational dialogue analysis, with linguistic cues (causality vs. tentativeness) as critical predictors of model correctness.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed to automatically label and analyze educational dialogue at scale, yet current pipelines lack reliable ways to detect when models are wrong. We investigate whether reasoning generated by LLMs can be used to predict the correctness of a model's own predictions. We analyze 30,300 teacher utterances from classroom dialogue, each labeled by multiple state-of-the-art LLMs with an instructional move construct and an accompanying reasoning. Using human-verified ground-truth labels, we frame the task as predicting whether a model's assigned label for a given utterance is correct. We encode LLM reasoning using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and evaluate five supervised classifiers. A Random Forest classifier achieves an F1 score of 0.83 (Recall = 0.854), successfully identifying most incorrect predictions and outperforming baselines. Training specialist detectors for specific instructional move constructs further improves performance on difficult constructs, indicating that error detection benefits from construct-specific linguistic cues. Using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) framework, we examine four linguistic markers of correctness: Causation, Differentiation, Tentativeness, and Insight. Correct predictions exhibit grounded causal language (e.g., because, therefore), while incorrect reasoning is substantially more likely to rely on epistemic hedging (e.g., might, could) and performative metacognition (e.g., think, realize). Syntactic complexity does not distinguish correct from incorrect reasoning, and longer reasoning is not more reliable. These findings demonstrate that reasoning-based error detection offers a practical and scalable approach to quality control in automated educational dialogue analysis.

Result: 物体数量增加会降低量化倾向和精确度；有生命的物体及产出方式影响策略选择。

Conclusion: 揭示了自然语境下量化的关键影响因素，为量化表达研究提供了自然数据集。

Abstract: Quantification is a fundamental component of everyday language use, yet little is known about how speakers decide whether and how to quantify in naturalistic production. We investigate quantification in Mandarin Chinese using a picture-based elicited description task in which speakers freely described scenes containing multiple objects, without explicit instructions to count or quantify. Across both spoken and written modalities, we examine three aspects of quantification: whether speakers choose to quantify at all, how precise their quantification is, and which quantificational strategies they adopt. Results show that object numerosity, animacy, and production modality systematically shape quantificational behaviour. In particular, increasing numerosity reduces both the likelihood and the precision of quantification, while animate referents and modality selectively modulate strategy choice. This study demonstrates how quantification can be examined under unconstrained production conditions and provides a naturalistic dataset for further analyses of quantity expression in language production.

Motivation: 解决低资源语言神经机器翻译中文化相关习语处理的数据匮乏问题，填补文化感知翻译的基准空白。

Method: 创建跨语言注释的Sinhala习语语料库，设计二分类器识别习语类型，通过定量实验评估LLM翻译准确性。

Result: 成功分类跨文化习语起源（92%分类准确率），验证LLM在惯用语义表达上的系统性缺陷。

Conclusion: 数据集为低资源NLP提供文化基准，呼吁改进LLM的文化理解能力，推动跨语言习语翻译方法研究。

Abstract: Figures of Speech (FoS) consist of multi-word phrases that are deeply intertwined with culture. While Neural Machine Translation (NMT) performs relatively well with the figurative expressions of high-resource languages, it often faces challenges when dealing with low-resource languages like Sinhala due to limited available data. To address this limitation, we introduce a corpus of 2,344 Sinhala figures of speech with cultural and cross-lingual annotations. We examine this dataset to classify the cultural origins of the figures of speech and to identify their cross-lingual equivalents. Additionally, we have developed a binary classifier to differentiate between two types of FOS in the dataset, achieving an accuracy rate of approximately 92%. We also evaluate the performance of existing LLMs on this dataset. Our findings reveal significant shortcomings in the current capabilities of LLMs, as these models often struggle to accurately convey idiomatic meanings. By making this dataset publicly available, we offer a crucial benchmark for future research in low-resource NLP and culturally aware machine translation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有steering方法通过全局修改模型内部状态进行控制，但导致属性-效用权衡问题，因为行为由少量异质组件决定。

Method: 将steering向量转化为对单个注意力头和MLP神经元的诊断性权重编辑，实现选择性行为影响重分配。

Conclusion: 建立了表示引导与权重编辑的理论桥梁，提供可解释、无需训练的参数更新方案，兼容并行推理优化。

Abstract: Steering methods influence Large Language Model behavior by identifying semantic directions in hidden representations, but are typically realized through inference-time activation interventions that apply a fixed, global modification to the model's internal states. While effective, such interventions often induce unfavorable attribute-utility trade-offs under strong control, as they ignore the fact that many behaviors are governed by a small and heterogeneous subset of model components. We propose Steer2Edit, a theoretically grounded, training-free framework that transforms steering vectors from inference-time control signals into diagnostic signals for component-level rank-1 weight editing. Instead of uniformly injecting a steering direction during generation, Steer2Edit selectively redistributes behavioral influence across individual attention heads and MLP neurons, yielding interpretable edits that preserve the standard forward pass and remain compatible with optimized parallel inference. Across safety alignment, hallucination mitigation, and reasoning efficiency, Steer2Edit consistently achieves more favorable attribute-utility trade-offs: at matched downstream performance, it improves safety by up to 17.2%, increases truthfulness by 9.8%, and reduces reasoning length by 12.2% on average. Overall, Steer2Edit provides a principled bridge between representation steering and weight editing by translating steering signals into interpretable, training-free parameter updates.

Motivation: 探索大语言模型构建的多智能体系统在自我进化过程中如何维持安全对齐，提出自我进化三重困境问题。

Method: 通过信息论框架形式化安全定义，结合理论证明（统计盲点导致安全对齐不可逆退化）与Moltbook开放社区及封闭系统的实证分析。

Result: 理论证明孤立的自我进化必然导致安全对齐降级，实证观测到与理论预测一致的安全侵蚀现象。

Conclusion: 揭示了AI社会自我进化的基本限制，提出需外部监督或新型安全保护机制，推动安全研究从补丁式修复转向动态风险原理性理解。

Abstract: The emergence of multi-agent systems built from large language models (LLMs) offers a promising paradigm for scalable collective intelligence and self-evolution. Ideally, such systems would achieve continuous self-improvement in a fully closed loop while maintaining robust safety alignment--a combination we term the self-evolution trilemma. However, we demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that an agent society satisfying continuous self-evolution, complete isolation, and safety invariance is impossible. Drawing on an information-theoretic framework, we formalize safety as the divergence degree from anthropic value distributions. We theoretically demonstrate that isolated self-evolution induces statistical blind spots, leading to the irreversible degradation of the system's safety alignment. Empirical and qualitative results from an open-ended agent community (Moltbook) and two closed self-evolving systems reveal phenomena that align with our theoretical prediction of inevitable safety erosion. We further propose several solution directions to alleviate the identified safety concern. Our work establishes a fundamental limit on the self-evolving AI societies and shifts the discourse from symptom-driven safety patches to a principled understanding of intrinsic dynamical risks, highlighting the need for external oversight or novel safety-preserving mechanisms.

### [125] [LLMs Encode Their Failures: Predicting Success from Pre-Generation Activations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09924)
*William Lugoloobi,Thomas Foster,William Bankes,Chris Russell*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores using internal model representations to predict task success in LLMs, enabling efficient inference routing that reduces computational costs by up to 70% while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Running LLMs with extended reasoning on all problems is computationally expensive. The challenge is identifying which inputs require extra computation without prior knowledge, prompting research into using model internal states for prediction.

Method: Trained linear probes on pre-generation model activations to predict success on math/coding tasks. Compared predictions to surface features (e.g., question length) and analyzed human-model difficulty differences using E2H-AMC datasets.

Result: Probes outperformed surface features in success prediction. Models demonstrated distinct, internal notions of difficulty divergent from human assessments, especially with extended reasoning. Query routing across models via probes reduced inference costs by up to 70% on MATH while exceeding single-model performance.

Conclusion: Internal LLM representations encode task difficulty signals that enable practical efficiency gains through inference routing, even when diverging from human intuition about problem complexity.

Abstract: Running LLMs with extended reasoning on every problem is expensive, but determining which inputs actually require additional compute remains challenging. We investigate whether their own likelihood of success is recoverable from their internal representations before generation, and if this signal can guide more efficient inference. We train linear probes on pre-generation activations to predict policy-specific success on math and coding tasks, substantially outperforming surface features such as question length and TF-IDF. Using E2H-AMC, which provides both human and model performance on identical problems, we show that models encode a model-specific notion of difficulty that is distinct from human difficulty, and that this distinction increases with extended reasoning. Leveraging these probes, we demonstrate that routing queries across a pool of models can exceed the best-performing model whilst reducing inference cost by up to 70\% on MATH, showing that internal representations enable practical efficiency gains even when they diverge from human intuitions about difficulty.

TL;DR: 本文提出ATTNPO方法，通过利用模型内部注意力信号，有效减少推理模型中的冗余思考步骤，同时提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型使用强化学习和可验证奖励（RLVR）易产生冗余思考，现有轨迹级长度惩罚无法有效缩短推理长度或损害准确性。传统过程监督方法资源消耗高且回归信用分配不准确。

Method: 提出ATTNPO框架：1）识别专注关键步骤的特殊注意力头；2）根据注意力得分采用两种策略，分别抑制冗余步骤并减轻对必要步骤的惩罚。

Result: 实验表明，ATTNPO在9个基准测试中，推理长度显著缩短且性能稳定提升。

Conclusion: ATTNPO通过细粒度注意力信用分配，实现低开销、高效的过程监督，解决了RLVR模型的冗余思考问题，在效率和准确性间取得平衡。

Abstract: Large reasoning models trained with reinforcement learning and verifiable rewards (RLVR) achieve strong performance on complex reasoning tasks, yet often overthink, generating redundant reasoning without performance gains. Existing trajectory-level length penalties often fail to effectively shorten reasoning length and degrade accuracy, as they uniformly treat all reasoning steps and lack fine-grained signals to distinguish redundancy from necessity. Meanwhile, process-supervised methods are typically resource-intensive and suffer from inaccurate credit assignment. To address these issues, we propose ATTNPO, a low-overhead process-supervised RL framework that leverages the model's intrinsic attention signals for step-level credit assignment. We first identify a set of special attention heads that naturally focus on essential steps while suppressing redundant ones. By leveraging the attention scores of these heads, We then employ two sub-strategies to mitigate overthinking by discouraging redundant steps while preserving accuracy by reducing penalties on essential steps. Experimental results show that ATTNPO substantially reduces reasoning length while significantly improving performance across 9 benchmarks.

Abstract: Multiple-choice Reading Comprehension (MCRC) models aim to select the correct answer from a set of candidate options for a given question. However, they typically lack the ability to explain the reasoning behind their choices. In this paper, we introduce a novel Vietnamese dataset designed to train and evaluate MCRC models with explanation generation capabilities. Furthermore, we propose ViMultiChoice, a new method specifically designed for modeling Vietnamese reading comprehension that jointly predicts the correct answer and generates a corresponding explanation. Experimental results demonstrate that ViMultiChoice outperforms existing MCRC baselines, achieving state-of-the-art (SotA) performance on both the ViMMRC 2.0 benchmark and the newly introduced dataset. Additionally, we show that jointly training option decision and explanation generation leads to significant improvements in multiple-choice accuracy.

Conclusion: 否定'先天语法唯一解'的主张，证明非语言特异性机制也可产生句法泛化，但要实现儿童数据效率需更多未发现的归纳偏置

Abstract: How can children acquire native-level syntax from limited input? According to the Poverty of the Stimulus Hypothesis (PoSH), the linguistic input children receive is insufficient to explain certain generalizations that are robustly learned; innate linguistic constraints, many have argued, are thus necessary to explain language learning. Neural language models, which lack such language-specific constraints in their design, offer a computational test of this longstanding (but controversial) claim. We introduce \poshbench, a training-and-evaluation suite targeting question formation, islands to movement, and other English phenomena at the center of the PoSH arguments. Training Transformer models on 10--50M words of developmentally plausible text, we find indications of generalization on all phenomena even without direct positive evidence -- yet neural models remain less data-efficient and their generalizations are weaker than those of children. We further enhance our models with three recently proposed cognitively motivated inductive biases. We find these biases improve general syntactic competence but not \poshbench performance. Our findings challenge the claim that innate syntax is the only possible route to generalization, while suggesting that human-like data efficiency requires inductive biases beyond those tested here.

Conclusion: 音素建模范式显著提升越南语ASR性能，为拼音正字法语言提供新范式，代码开源将推动相关研究进展。

Abstract: Vietnamese has a phonetic orthography, where each grapheme corresponds to at most one phoneme and vice versa. Exploiting this high grapheme-phoneme transparency, we propose ViSpeechFormer (\textbf{Vi}etnamese \textbf{Speech} Trans\textbf{Former}), a phoneme-based approach for Vietnamese Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first Vietnamese ASR framework that explicitly models phonemic representations. Experiments on two publicly available Vietnamese ASR datasets show that ViSpeechFormer achieves strong performance, generalizes better to out-of-vocabulary words, and is less affected by training bias. This phoneme-based paradigm is also promising for other languages with phonetic orthographies. The code will be released upon acceptance of this paper.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to support question answering and decision-making in high-stakes, domain-specific settings such as natural hazard response and infrastructure planning, where effective answers must convey fine-grained, decision-critical details. However, existing evaluation frameworks for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and open-ended question answering primarily rely on surface-level similarity, factual consistency, or semantic relevance, and often fail to assess whether responses provide the specific information required for domain-sensitive decisions. To address this gap, we propose a multi-dimensional, reference-free evaluation framework that assesses LLM outputs along four complementary dimensions: specificity, robustness to paraphrasing and semantic perturbations, answer relevance, and context utilization. We introduce a curated dataset of 1,412 domain-specific question-answer pairs spanning 40 professional roles and seven natural hazard types to support systematic evaluation. We further conduct human evaluation to assess inter-annotator agreement and alignment between model outputs and human judgments, which highlights the inherent subjectivity of open-ended, domain-specific evaluation. Our results show that no single metric sufficiently captures answer quality in isolation and demonstrate the need for structured, multi-metric evaluation frameworks when deploying LLMs in high-stakes applications.

*Wenxuan Xie,Yujia Wang,Xin Tan,Chaochao Lu,Xia Hu,Xuhong Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces DRIFT, a dual-model architecture that separates knowledge extraction from reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) to address challenges in integrating dynamic knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Integrating dynamic knowledge into LLMs is challenging due to the entanglement of factual data and reasoning patterns. Existing methods like RAG or parametric editing face limitations such as context window constraints, retriever noise, or catastrophic forgetting.

Method: DRIFT uses a lightweight knowledge model to dynamically compress document chunks into implicit fact tokens based on queries. These dense representations project into the reasoning model's embedding space, replacing raw text to reduce redundancy while preserving accuracy.

Result: DRIFT significantly outperforms baselines on long-context tasks among models of comparable size, demonstrating improved performance and efficiency in handling extended context windows.

Conclusion: DRIFT provides a scalable paradigm for extending the effective context window and reasoning capabilities of LLMs, enabling efficient integration of dynamic knowledge without compromising accuracy.

Abstract: The integration of extensive, dynamic knowledge into Large Language Models (LLMs) remains a significant challenge due to the inherent entanglement of factual data and reasoning patterns. Existing solutions, ranging from non-parametric Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to parametric knowledge editing, are often constrained in practice by finite context windows, retriever noise, or the risk of catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we propose DRIFT, a novel dual-model architecture designed to explicitly decouple knowledge extraction from the reasoning process. Unlike static prompt compression, DRIFT employs a lightweight knowledge model to dynamically compress document chunks into implicit fact tokens conditioned on the query. These dense representations are projected into the reasoning model's embedding space, replacing raw, redundant text while maintaining inference accuracy. Extensive experiments show that DRIFT significantly improves performance on long-context tasks, outperforming strong baselines among comparably sized models. Our approach provides a scalable and efficient paradigm for extending the effective context window and reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/Lancelot-Xie/DRIFT.

Conclusion: 多智能体协作框架显著提升科学图表分析性能，复杂任务处理能力与知识集成效率呈正相关，为跨学科科学推理提供新范式。

Abstract: In scientific research, analysis requires accurately interpreting complex multimodal knowledge, integrating evidence from different sources, and drawing inferences grounded in domain-specific knowledge. However, current artificial intelligence (AI) systems struggle to consistently demonstrate such capabilities. The complexity and variability of scientific tables and figures, combined with heterogeneous structures and long-context requirements, pose fundamental obstacles to scientific table \& figure analysis. To quantify these challenges, we introduce AnaBench, a large-scale benchmark featuring $63,178$ instances from nine scientific domains, systematically categorized along seven complexity dimensions. To tackle these challenges, we propose Anagent, a multi-agent framework for enhanced scientific table \& figure analysis through four specialized agents: Planner decomposes tasks into actionable subtasks, Expert retrieves task-specific information through targeted tool execution, Solver synthesizes information to generate coherent analysis, and Critic performs iterative refinement through five-dimensional quality assessment. We further develop modular training strategies that leverage supervised finetuning and specialized reinforcement learning to optimize individual capabilities while maintaining effective collaboration. Comprehensive evaluation across 170 subdomains demonstrates that Anagent achieves substantial improvements, up to $\uparrow 13.43\%$ in training-free settings and $\uparrow 42.12\%$ with finetuning, while revealing that task-oriented reasoning and context-aware problem-solving are essential for high-quality scientific table \& figure analysis.

Motivation: 现有基准测试侧重量子代码生成和电路设计，但缺乏对语言模型量子计算概念理解力的系统性评估，量子-Audit旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 构建包含1,000道专家出题、1,000道LLM生成经专家验证、700道包含开放性及错误前提问题的量子计算测试集，评估26个主流模型的表现。

Result: 人类专家得分74%平均，Claude Opus 4.5达84%但专家出题准确率下降12%；安全类问题准确率降至73%，错误前提修正任务准确率低于66%。

Conclusion: 语言模型虽超越人类专家水平，但在深度理解量子概念、安全领域及批判性思维方面仍存在显著缺陷，提示需改进复杂推理和错误检测机制。

Abstract: Language models have become practical tools for quantum computing education and research, from summarizing technical papers to explaining theoretical concepts and answering questions about recent developments in the field. While existing benchmarks evaluate quantum code generation and circuit design, their understanding of quantum computing concepts has not been systematically measured. Quantum-Audit addresses this gap with 2,700 questions covering core quantum computing topics. We evaluate 26 models from leading organizations. Our benchmark comprises 1,000 expert-written questions, 1,000 questions extracted from research papers using LLMs and validated by experts, plus an additional 700 questions including 350 open-ended questions and 350 questions with false premises to test whether models can correct erroneous assumptions. Human participants scored between 23% and 86%, with experts averaging 74%. Top-performing models exceeded the expert average, with Claude Opus 4.5 reaching 84% accuracy, though top models showed an average 12-point accuracy drop on expert-written questions compared to LLM-generated ones. Performance declined further on advanced topics, dropping to 73% on security questions. Additionally, models frequently accepted and reinforced false premises embedded in questions instead of identifying them, with accuracy below 66% on these critical reasoning tasks.
