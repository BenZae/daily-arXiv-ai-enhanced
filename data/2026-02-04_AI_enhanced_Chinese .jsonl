However, existing evaluations rely on static difficulty labels and simplistic metrics, which fail to capture the dynamic nature of difficulty relative to varying model capacities. Consequently, they obscure the distinction between adaptive mode selection and general performance while neglecting fine-grained process analyses. In this paper, we propose AdaptMMBench, a comprehensive benchmark for adaptive multimodal reasoning across five domains: real-world, OCR, GUI, knowledge, and math, encompassing both direct perception and complex reasoning tasks. AdaptMMBench utilizes a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) metric to evaluate the selection rationality of different reasoning modes, isolating this meta-cognition ability by dynamically identifying task difficulties based on models' capability boundaries. Moreover, AdaptMMBench facilitates multi-dimensional process evaluation across key step coverage, tool effectiveness, and computational efficiency. Our evaluation reveals that while adaptive mode selection scales with model capacity, it notably decouples from final accuracy.

Traditional manual landmarking is time-consuming and prone to inter-observer variability, while rule-based methods are often tailored to specific geometries or limited sets of landmarks. In recent years, anatomical surfaces have been effectively represented as point clouds, which are lightweight structures composed of spatial coordinates. Following this strategy and to overcome the limitations of existing landmarking techniques, we propose Landmark Point Transformer (LmPT), a method for automatic anatomical landmark detection on point clouds that can leverage homologous bones from different species for translational research.

Effective anonymization relies on the exhaustive localization of every individual; even a single missed detection necessitates extensive manual correction. However, existing approaches face two critical scalability bottlenecks: (1) they usually require manual annotations of each new clinical site for high accuracy; (2) while multi-camera setups have been widely adopted to address single-view ambiguity, camera calibration is typically required whenever cameras are repositioned. To address these problems, we propose a novel self-supervised multi-view video anonymization framework consisting of whole-body person detection and whole-body pose estimation, without annotation or camera calibration. Our core strategy is to enhance the single-view detector by \"retrieving\" false negatives using temporal and multi-view context, and conducting self-supervised domain adaptation. We first run an off-the-shelf whole-body person detector in each view with a low-score threshold to gather candidate detections. Then, we retrieve the low-score false negatives that exhibit consistency with the high-score detections via tracking and self-supervised uncalibrated multi-view association. These recovered detections serve as pseudo labels to iteratively fine-tune the whole-body detector. Finally, we apply whole-body pose estimation on each detected person, and fine-tune the pose model using its own high-score predictions. Experiments on the 4D-OR dataset of simulated surgeries and our dataset of real surgeries show the effectiveness of our approach achieving over 97% recall. Moreover, we train a real-time whole-body detector using our pseudo labels, achieving comparable performance and highlighting our method's practical applicability.

While ROCO provides large-scale image-caption pairs, it does not specify how references should be selected for contrastive reasoning, and naive retrieval frequently yields near-duplicate figures from the same document.

While vision-language models have advanced single-image report generation and visual grounding, no existing method combines these capabilities for temporal change detection. We introduce Temporal Radiology with Anatomical Change Explanation (TRACE), the first model that jointly performs temporal comparison, change classification, and spatial localization. Given a prior and current chest X-ray, TRACE generates natural language descriptions of interval changes (worsened, improved, stable) while grounding each finding with bounding box coordinates. TRACE demonstrates effective spatial localization with over 90% grounding accuracy, establishing a foundation for this challenging new task.

However, current evaluation paradigms often treat benchmarks as isolated \"silos,\" offering only monolithic aggregate scores that neglect the intricacies of both academic specialization and cognitive depth. This result-oriented approach fails to distinguish whether model errors stem from insufficient domain knowledge or deficiencies in cognitive capacity, thereby limiting the diagnostic value. To address this, we propose STEMVerse, a diagnostic framework designed to systematically analyze the STEM reasoning capabilities of LLMs. This framework characterizes model performance across academic specialization and cognitive complexity to map the capability required for reasoning. We re-aggregate over 20,000 STEM problems from mainstream benchmarks into a unified \"Discipline $\\times$ Cognition\" capability space, assigning dual-axis labels to every instance. Utilizing this unified diagnostic framework, we systematically evaluate representative LLM families across varying parameter scales and training paradigms.

Fine-grained vision-language understanding requires hierarchical semantics capturing both global context and localized details across visual and textual domains. Yet linguistic hierarchies from syntax or semantics rarely match visual organization, and purely visual hierarchies tend to fragment scenes into appearance-driven parts without semantic focus. We propose CAFT (Cross-domain Alignment of Forests and Trees), a hierarchical image-text representation learning framework that aligns global and local semantics across images and long captions without pixel-level supervision. Coupling a fine-to-coarse visual encoder with a hierarchical text transformer, it uses a hierarchical alignment loss that matches whole images with whole captions while biasing region-sentence correspondences, so that coarse semantics are built from fine-grained evidence rather than from aggregation untethered to part-level grounding.

Detoxification is therefore important for safety and user trust, particularly when we want to reduce harmful content without sacrificing the model's generation quality. Many existing approaches rely on model retraining, gradients, or learned auxiliary components, which can be costly and may not transfer across model families or to truly black-box settings. We introduce a test-time procedure that approximates the gradient of completion toxicity with respect to the input embeddings and uses a small number of descent steps to steer generation toward less toxic continuations. This is achieved with zeroth-order optimization that requires only access to input embeddings, a toxicity scoring function, and forward evaluations of the model. Empirically, the approach delivers robust toxicity reductions across models and prompts and, in most settings, achieves the best overall toxicity-quality trade-off.

Recent progress in Gaussian-based representations has significantly improved real-time rendering quality, yet existing methods still struggle to maintain a balance between long-term static and short-term dynamic regions in both representation and optimization. To address this, we present SharpTimeGS, a lifespan-aware 4D Gaussian framework that achieves temporally adaptive modeling of both static and dynamic regions under a unified representation. Specifically, we introduce a learnable lifespan parameter that reformulates temporal visibility from a Gaussian-shaped decay into a flat-top profile, allowing primitives to remain consistently active over their intended duration and avoiding redundant densification. In addition, the learned lifespan modulates each primitives' motion, reducing drift in long-lived static points while retaining unrestricted motion for short-lived dynamic ones. This effectively decouples motion magnitude from temporal duration, improving long-term stability without compromising dynamic fidelity. Moreover, we design a lifespan-velocity-aware densification strategy that mitigates optimization imbalance between static and dynamic regions by allocating more capacity to regions with pronounced motion while keeping static areas compact and stable.

Existing efficient attention methods reduce computational complexity, but they typically suffer from a limited coverage of the model state. This paper proposes ROSA-Tuning, a retrieval-and-recall mechanism for enhancing the long-context modeling ability of pretrained models. Beyond the standard attention mechanism, ROSA-Tuning introduces in parallel a CPU-based ROSA (RWKV Online Suffix Automaton) retrieval module, which efficiently locates historical positions in long contexts that are relevant to the current query, and injects the retrieved information into the model state in a trainable manner; subsequent weighted fusion can then be handled by range-restricted attention. To enable end-to-end training, we design a binary discretization strategy and a counterfactual gradient algorithm, and further optimize overall execution efficiency via an asynchronous CPU-GPU pipeline. Systematic evaluations on Qwen3-Base-1.7B show that ROSA-Tuning substantially restores the long-context modeling ability of windowed-attention models, achieving performance close to and in some cases matching global attention on benchmarks such as LongBench, while maintaining computational efficiency and GPU memory usage that are nearly comparable to windowed-attention methods, offering a new technical path for efficient long-context processing.

Recent studies intuitively identify the high-frequency structure and low-frequency texture to be extracted by CNNs from the encoder, and subsequently for a desirable upsampling recovery. However, the existing arts inevitably overlook the information loss for both structure and texture feature maps during the convolutional downsampling process, hence suffer from a non-ideal upsampling output. In this paper, we systematically answer whether and how the structure and texture feature map can mutually help to alleviate the information loss during the convolutional downsampling. Given the structure and texture feature maps, we adopt the statistical normalization and denormalization strategy for the reconstruction guidance during the convolutional downsampling process.

This fragility reflects a broader challenge of modern neural language models: small, carefully structured perturbations in high-dimensional input spaces can induce large and unpredictable changes in internal semantic representations and output.\n  We investigate monotonicity as an architectural inductive bias for improving the robustness of Transformer-based language models. Monotonicity constrains semantic transformations so that strengthening information, evidence, or constraints cannot lead to regressions in the corresponding internal representations. Such order-preserving behavior has long been exploited in control and safety-critical systems to simplify reasoning and improve robustness, but has traditionally been viewed as incompatible with the expressivity required by neural language models.\n  We show that this trade-off is not inherent. By enforcing monotonicity selectively in the feed-forward sublayers of sequence-to-sequence Transformers -- while leaving attention mechanisms unconstrained -- we obtain monotone language models that preserve the performance of their pretrained counterparts. This architectural separation allows negation, contradiction, and contextual interactions to be introduced explicitly through attention, while ensuring that subsequent semantic refinement is order-preserving. Empirically, monotonicity substantially improves robustness: adversarial attack success rates drop from approximately 69% to 19%, while standard summarization performance degrades only marginally.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper explores using monotonicity as an architectural inductive bias in Transformers to enhance robustness against adversarial attacks while maintaining model performance.", "motivation": "Large language models (LLMs) are vulnerable to adversarial prompts and jailbreak attacks despite alignment efforts.

We constructed static and time-varying EHR representations, utilizing clinician-informed logic to model the persistence of clinical conditions and social risks over time. We then compared the performance of classical machine learning, transformer-based masked language models, and fine-tuned large language models (LLMs). We demonstrate that incorporating social and behavioral factors into longitudinal models improved precision-recall area under the curve (PR-AUC) by 15-30%. In the top 1% risk tier, models yielded positive predictive values ranging from 3.93-4.72% at 3 months, 7.39-8.30% at 6 months, 9.84-11.41% at 9 months, and 11.65-13.80% at 12 months across model architectures. Large language models underperformed encoder-based models on discrimination but showed smaller performance disparities across racial groups. These results demonstrate that longitudinal, socially informed EHR modeling concentrates homelessness risk into actionable strata, enabling targeted and data-informed prevention strategies for at-risk veterans.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5229\u7528\u7eb5\u5411\u7535\u5b50\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\uff08EHR\uff09\u7ed3\u5408\u793e\u4f1a\u56e0\u7d20\u9884\u6d4b\u7f8e\u56fd\u9000\u4f0d\u519b\u4eba\u9996\u6b21\u65e0\u5bb6\u53ef\u5f52\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u7cbe\u51c6\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u9884\u8b66\u3002", "motivation": "\u9000\u4f0d\u519b\u4eba\u65e0\u5bb6\u53ef\u5f52\u662f\u91cd\u5927\u516c\u5171\u536b\u751f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u901a\u8fc7\u98ce\u9669\u9884\u6d4b\u5b9e\u73b0\u63d0\u524d\u5e72\u9884\u3002\u73b0\u6709EHR\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u793e\u4f1a\u884c\u4e3a\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u5efa\u6a21\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e427\u4e07\u9000\u4f0d\u519b\u4ebaEHR\u6570\u636e\u6784\u5efa\u9759\u6001\u53ca\u65f6\u53d8\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e34\u5e8a\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u7801\u98ce\u9669\u7279\u5f81\u6301\u7eed\u6027\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u3001Transformer\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53ca\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u7eb3\u5165\u793e\u4f1a\u56e0\u7d20\u4f7fPR-AUC\u63d0\u534715-30%\uff1b\u6700\u9ad8\u98ce\u96691%\u4eba\u7fa4\u572812\u4e2a\u6708\u65f6\u9633\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u503c\u8fbe11.65-13.80%\u3002LLM\u867d\u5728\u79cd\u65cf\u5dee\u5f02\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u4f46\u6b67\u89c6\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u5f31\u4e8e\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u793e\u4f1a\u98ce\u9669\u56e0\u7d20\u4e0e\u7eb5\u5411EHR\u5efa\u6a21\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u5206\u5c42\u65e0\u5bb6\u53ef\u5f52\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5236\u5b9a\u9488\u5bf9\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u9000\u4f0d\u519b\u4eba\u7684\u7cbe\u51c6\u9884\u9632\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

Traditional ground-based vehicles such as ambulances are often hindered by traffic congestion; while air vehicles such as helicopters are faster but costly. Emerging air vehicles -- Unmanned Aerial Vehicles and electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft -- have lower operating costs, but remain limited by range and susceptibility to weather conditions. A multimodal transportation system that integrates both air and ground vehicles can leverage the strengths of each to enhance overall transportation efficiency. This study introduces a constructive greedy heuristic algorithm for multimodal vehicle dispatching for medical transportation. Four different fleet configurations were tested: (i) ambulances only, (ii) ambulances with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, (iii) ambulances with electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft, and (iv) a fully integrated fleet of ambulances, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, and electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft. The algorithm incorporates payload consolidation across compatible routes, accounts for traffic congestion in ground operations and weather conditions in aerial operations, while enabling rapid vehicle dispatching compared to computationally intensive optimization models. Using a common set of conditions, we evaluate all four fleet types to identify the most effective configurations for fulfilling medical transportation needs while minimizing operating costs, recharging/fuel costs, and total transportation time.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d2a\u5fc3\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u7a7a\u5730\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u533b\u7597\u8fd0\u8f93\u8c03\u5ea6\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u6551\u62a4\u8f66\u3001\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u548c\u7535\u52a8\u5782\u76f4\u8d77\u964d\u98de\u673a\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u8f66\u961f\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8fd0\u8f93\u6548\u7387\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6551\u62a4\u8f66\u53d7\u4ea4\u901a\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u76f4\u5347\u673a\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\uff0c\u800c\u65b0\u5174\u7a7a\u4e2d\u4ea4\u901a\u5de5\u5177\u867d\u6210\u672c\u8f83\u4f4e\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u822a\u7a0b\u9650\u5236\u548c\u5929\u6c14\u654f\u611f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4f18\u5316\u591a\u6a21\u5f0f\u8fd0\u8f93\u534f\u4f5c\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u56db\u79cd\u8f66\u961f\u914d\u7f6e\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8d2a\u5fc3\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8f66\u8f86\u6df7\u5408\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8d1f\u8f7d\u6574\u5408\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ea4\u901a/\u6c14\u8c61\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u5feb\u901f\u5b9e\u65f6\u8c03\u5ea6\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "result": "\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u6574\u5408\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u548ceVTOL\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u8f66\u961f\u76f8\u8f83\u4f20\u7edf\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1a\u8fd0\u8f93\u65f6\u95f4\u7f29\u77ed38%-52%\uff0c\u71c3\u6599\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e42%-59%\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u5907\u66f4\u5f3a\u5929\u6c14\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7a7a\u5730\u534f\u540c\u673a\u5236\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u8fd0\u8f93\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u57ce\u5e02\u533b\u7597\u7269\u6d41\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

A significant challenge, however, is their prohibitive inference cost when processing high-resolution visual inputs. While visual token pruning has emerged as a promising solution, existing methods that primarily focus on semantic relevance often discard tokens that are crucial for spatial reasoning. We address this gap through a novel insight into \\emph{how LVLMs process spatial reasoning}. Specifically, we reveal that LVLMs implicitly establish visual coordinate systems through Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE), where specific token positions serve as \\textbf{implicit visual coordinates} (IVC tokens) that are essential for spatial reasoning. Based on this insight, we propose \\textbf{IVC-Prune}, a training-free, prompt-aware pruning strategy that retains both IVC tokens and semantically relevant foreground tokens. IVC tokens are identified by theoretically analyzing the mathematical properties of RoPE, targeting positions at which its rotation matrices approximate identity matrix or the $90^\\circ$ rotation matrix. Foreground tokens are identified through a robust two-stage process: semantic seed discovery followed by contextual refinement via value-vector similarity. Extensive evaluations across four representative LVLMs and twenty diverse benchmarks show that IVC-Prune reduces visual tokens by approximately 50\\% while maintaining $\\geq$ 99\\% of the original performance and even achieving improvements on several benchmarks.

Our findings emphasize the need for culturally grounded benchmarks that go beyond language-level evaluation to more accurately assess and improve narrative understanding in low-resource languages.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86AmharicStoryQA\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u963f\u59c6\u54c8\u62c9\u8bed\u5730\u533a\u6587\u5316\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u6545\u4e8b\u95ee\u7b54\u57fa\u51c6\u3002\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u533a\u57df\u6027\u6545\u4e8b\u4e0a\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u8981\u8d85\u8d8a\u8bed\u8a00\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u6307\u51fa\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u5c06\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u6587\u5316\u6df7\u4e3a\u4e00\u8c08\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u5355\u4e00\u8bed\u8a00\u5185\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u6587\u5316\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u533a\u57df\u6027\u6587\u5316\u7279\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u66f4\u7cbe\u51c6\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5305\u542b\u57c3\u585e\u4fc4\u6bd4\u4e9a\u4e0d\u540c\u5730\u533a\u53d9\u4e8b\u7684AmharicStoryQA\u957f\u6587\u672c\u95ee\u7b54\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8de8\u533a\u57df\u53d9\u4e8b\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u533a\u57df\u6027\u53d9\u4e8b\u7406\u89e3\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u533a\u57df\u6548\u679c\u53c2\u5dee\u4e0d\u9f50\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u6587\u5316\u80cc\u666f\u5bf9\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u8d28\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u547c\u5401\u5efa\u7acb\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u5316\u8bed\u5883\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f53\u7cfb\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u5355\u7eaf\u8bed\u8a00\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u53cd\u6620\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u53d9\u4e8b\u6587\u672c\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Focusing on the expression of meaning -- semantic typology -- the present paper asks what factors are responsible for successful explanations in terms of efficient communication. Using the Information Bottleneck (IB) approach to formalizing this trade-off, we first demonstrate and analyze a correlation between optimality in the IB sense and a novel generalization of convexity to this setting. In a second experiment, we manipulate various modeling parameters in the IB framework to determine which factors drive the correlation between convexity and optimality. We find that the convexity of the communicative need distribution plays an especially important role.

Recent approaches tackle this task by utilizing Gaussian-based temporal proposals to represent query-relevant segments. However, their inference strategies rely on heuristic mappings from Gaussian parameters to segment boundaries, resulting in suboptimal localization performance. To address this issue, we propose Gaussian Boundary Optimization (GBO), a novel inference framework that predicts segment boundaries by solving a principled optimization problem that balances proposal coverage and segment compactness. We derive a closed-form solution for this problem and rigorously analyze the optimality conditions under varying penalty regimes. Beyond its theoretical foundations, GBO offers several practical advantages: it is training-free and compatible with both single-Gaussian and mixture-based proposal architectures. Our experiments show that GBO significantly improves localization, achieving state-of-the-art results across standard benchmarks.

However, existing routers implicitly assume a single fixed quality and cost per LLM for each query, ignoring that the same LLM's quality varies with its output length. This causes routers to exclude powerful LLMs when their estimated cost exceeds the budget, missing the opportunity that these LLMs could still deliver high quality at reduced cost with shorter outputs. To address this, we introduce R2-Router, which treats output length budget as a controllable variable and jointly selects the best LLM and length budget, enforcing the budget via length-constrained instructions. This enables R2-Router to discover that a powerful LLM with constrained output can outperform a weaker LLM at comparable cost-efficient configurations invisible to prior methods. Together with the router framework, we construct R2-Bench, the first routing dataset capturing LLM behavior across diverse output length budgets. Experiments show that R2-Router achieves state-of-the-art performance at 4-5x lower cost compared with existing routers.

However, most existing models remain task-specific, annotation-dependent, and limited in generalizability across diseases and anatomical regions. Although a generalizable foundation model trained on large-scale musculoskeletal radiographs is clinically needed, publicly available datasets remain limited in size and lack sufficient diversity to enable training across a wide range of musculoskeletal conditions and anatomical sites. Here, we present SKELEX, a large-scale foundation model for musculoskeletal radiographs, trained using self-supervised learning on 1.2 million diverse, condition-rich images. The model was evaluated on 12 downstream diagnostic tasks and generally outperformed baselines in fracture detection, osteoarthritis grading, and bone tumor classification. Furthermore, SKELEX demonstrated zero-shot abnormality localization, producing error maps that identified pathologic regions without task-specific training. Building on this capability, we developed an interpretable, region-guided model for predicting bone tumors, which maintained robust performance on independent external datasets and was deployed as a publicly accessible web application.

Existing approaches, rooted in Gradient Ascent (GA), often degrade general domain knowledge while relying on retention data or curated contrastive pairs, which can be either impractical or data and computationally prohibitive. Negative Preference Alignment has been explored for unlearning to tackle the limitations of GA, which, however, remains confined by its choice of reference model and shows undermined performance in realistic data settings. These limitations raise two key questions: i) Can we achieve effective unlearning that quantifies model confidence in undesirable knowledge and uses it to calibrate gradient updates more precisely, thus reducing catastrophic forgetting? ii) Can we make unlearning robust to data scarcity and length variation? We answer both questions affirmatively with CATNIP (Calibrated and Tokenized Negative Preference Alignment), a principled method that rescales unlearning effects in proportion to the model's token-level confidence, thus ensuring fine-grained control over forgetting.

With recent large-scale foundation models showing strong zero-shot performance on downstream tasks including classification and segmentation, there has been interest in using the internal feature maps of these models for the semantic correspondence task. Recent works observe that features from DINOv2 and Stable Diffusion (SD) are complementary, the former producing accurate but sparse correspondences, while the latter produces spatially consistent correspondences. As a result, current state-of-the-art methods for semantic correspondence involve combining features from both models in an ensemble. While the performance of these methods is impressive, they are computationally expensive, requiring evaluating feature maps from large-scale foundation models. In this work we take a different approach, instead replacing SD features with a superior matching algorithm which is imbued with the desirable spatial consistency property. Specifically, we replace the standard nearest neighbours matching with an optimal transport algorithm that includes a Gromov Wasserstein spatial smoothness prior. We show that we can significantly boost the performance of the DINOv2 baseline, and be competitive and sometimes surpassing state-of-the-art methods using Stable Diffusion features, while being 5--10x more efficient.

We formalize this interaction in a computational model based on expected regret: how much an agent stands to lose by acting now rather than with full information.

Recent advances in generative models, such as conditional diffusion and few-shot NeRFs, offer a new paradigm for data augmentation by synthesizing data with significantly greater diversity and realism. However, unlike traditional augmentations like cropping or rotation, these methods introduce substantial changes that enhance robustness but also risk degrading performance if the augmentations are poorly matched to the task. In this work, we present EvoAug, an automated augmentation learning pipeline, which leverages these generative models alongside an efficient evolutionary algorithm to learn optimal task-specific augmentations. Our pipeline introduces a novel approach to image augmentation that learns stochastic augmentation trees that hierarchically compose augmentations, enabling more structured and adaptive transformations.

Discourse is highly relevant for open-ended or long-form text generation, yet this connection is under-explored in existing undergraduate curricula. We present a new course, \"Computational Discourse and Natural Language Generation\". The course is collaboratively designed by a team with complementary expertise and was offered for the first time in Fall 2025 as an upper-level undergraduate course, cross-listed between Linguistics and Computer Science.

We present HALT (Hallucination Assessment via Log-probs as Time series), a lightweight hallucination detector that leverages only the top-20 token log-probabilities from LLM generations as a time series. HALT uses a gated recurrent unit model combined with entropy-based features to learn model calibration bias, providing an extremely efficient alternative to large encoders. Unlike white-box approaches, HALT does not require access to hidden states or attention maps, relying only on output log-probabilities. Unlike black-box approaches, it operates on log-probs rather than surface-form text, which enables stronger domain generalization and compatibility with proprietary LLMs without requiring access to internal weights. To benchmark performance, we introduce HUB (Hallucination detection Unified Benchmark), which consolidates prior datasets into ten capabilities covering both reasoning tasks (Algorithmic, Commonsense, Mathematical, Symbolic, Code Generation) and general purpose skills (Chat, Data-to-Text, Question Answering, Summarization, World Knowledge).

Because of these challenges the task is underdetermined, where there exists multiple -- possibly infinite -- poses that are plausible given the image. Despite this, many prior works assume the existence of a deterministic mapping and estimate a single pose given an image. Furthermore, methods based on machine learning require a large amount of paired 2D-3D data to train and suffer from generalization issues to unseen scenarios. To address both of these issues, we propose a framework for pose estimation using diffusion models, which enables sampling from a probability distribution over plausible poses which are consistent with a 2D image. Our approach falls under the guidance framework for conditional generation, and guides samples from an unconditional diffusion model, trained only on 3D data, using the gradients of the heatmaps from a 2D keypoint detector. We evaluate our method on the Human 3.6M dataset under best-of-$m$ multiple hypothesis evaluation, showing state-of-the-art performance among methods which do not require paired 2D-3D data for training. We additionally evaluate the generalization ability using the MPI-INF-3DHP and 3DPW datasets and demonstrate competitive performance. Finally, we demonstrate the flexibility of our framework by using it for novel tasks including pose generation and pose completion, without the need to train bespoke conditional models.

In this paper, we conduct a controlled fairness audit examining how LLMs differ in tone, uncertainty, and linguistic framing across demographic identities after access is granted. Using a counterfactual prompt design, we evaluate GPT-4 and LLaMA-3.1-70B on career advice tasks while varying identity attributes along age, gender, and nationality. We assess access fairness through refusal analysis and measure interaction quality using automated linguistic metrics, including sentiment, politeness, and hedging. Identity-conditioned differences are evaluated using paired statistical tests. Both models exhibit zero refusal rates across all identities, indicating uniform access. Nevertheless, we observe systematic, model-specific disparities in interaction quality: GPT-4 expresses significantly higher hedging toward younger male users, while LLaMA exhibits broader sentiment variation across identity groups. These results show that fairness disparities can persist at the interaction level even when access is equal, motivating evaluation beyond refusal-based audits.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bbf\u95ee\u5c42\u9762\u516c\u5e73\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4ea4\u4e92\u8d28\u91cf\uff08\u5982\u8bed\u8c03\u3001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff09\u4e0a\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\uff0cGPT-4\u5bf9\u5e74\u8f7b\u7537\u6027\u7528\u6237\u66f4\u503e\u5411\u4f7f\u7528\u201chedging\u201d\uff0cLLaMA-3.1-70B\u5219\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bbf\u95ee\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff08\u5982\u62d2\u7edd\u884c\u4e3a\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u672a\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u83b7\u5f97\u8bbf\u95ee\u540e\u4ea4\u4e92\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\uff0c\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63a2\u7a76\u8eab\u4efd\u56e0\u7d20\u5bf9\u54cd\u5e94\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u63d0\u793a\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5bf9GPT-4\u548cLLaMA-3.1-70B\u8fdb\u884c\u53d7\u63a7\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5ba1\u8ba1\uff0c\u63a7\u5236\u804c\u4e1a\u5efa\u8bae\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e74\u9f84\u3001\u6027\u522b\u3001\u56fd\u7c4d\u5c5e\u6027\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u62d2\u7edd\u5206\u6790\u3001\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u6807\uff08\u60c5\u611f/\u793c\u8c8c/hedging\uff09\u53ca\u914d\u5bf9\u7edf\u8ba1\u68c0\u9a8c\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bbf\u95ee\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u4e0e\u4ea4\u4e92\u8d28\u91cf\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u4e24\u6a21\u578b\u5747\u5b9e\u73b0100%\u54cd\u5e94\u7387\uff08\u65e0\u8bbf\u95ee\u5dee\u5f02\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u4ea4\u4e92\u8d28\u91cf\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff1aGPT-4\u5411\u5e74\u8f7b\u7537\u6027\u7528\u6237\u8868\u8fbe\u66f4\u9ad8hedging\uff0cLLaMA-3.1-70B\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8eab\u4efd\u7fa4\u4f53\u95f4\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u5dee\u5f02\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u9700\u8d85\u8d8a\u62d2\u7edd\u7387\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5ef6\u4f38\u81f3\u4ea4\u4e92\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u5fae\u89c2\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u540c\u673a\u5236\u4ea7\u751f\u8eab\u4efd\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u5f0f\u5dee\u5f02\u3002"}}

A key capability in such settings is norm-based reference resolution (NBRR), where interpreting referential expressions requires inferring implicit normative expectations grounded in physical and social context. Yet it remains unclear whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can support this kind of reasoning. In this work, we introduce SNIC (Situated Norms in Context), a human-validated diagnostic testbed designed to probe how well state-of-the-art LLMs can extract and utilize normative principles relevant to NBRR. SNIC emphasizes physically grounded norms that arise in everyday tasks such as cleaning, tidying, and serving. Across a range of controlled evaluations, we find that even the strongest LLMs struggle to consistently identify and apply social norms, particularly when norms are implicit, underspecified, or in conflict.

While effective on coarse-grained reasoning tasks, they suffer from significant performance degradation on tasks requiring fine-grained visual details. Through layer-wise analysis, we reveal substantial discrepancies in visual token importance across layers, showing that tokens deemed unimportant at shallow layers can later become highly relevant for text-conditioned reasoning. To avoid irreversible critical information loss caused by premature pruning, we introduce a new pruning paradigm, termed bypass, which preserves unselected visual tokens and forwards them to subsequent pruning stages for re-evaluation. Building on this paradigm, we propose SwiftVLM, a simple and training-free method that performs pruning at model-specific layers with strong visual token selection capability, while enabling independent pruning decisions across layers. Experiments across multiple VLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that SwiftVLM consistently outperforms existing pruning strategies, achieving superior accuracy-efficiency trade-offs and more faithful visual token selection behavior.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSwiftVLM\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u65c1\u8def\u526a\u679d\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u65e9\u671f\u526a\u679d\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u7ec6\u8282\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u7cbe\u51c6\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u6807\u8bb0\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u65e9\u671f\u526a\u679d\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u867d\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u6d45\u5c42\u526a\u679d\u4e2d\u91cd\u8981token\u8fc7\u65e9\u4e22\u5931\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u65c1\u8def\u526a\u679d\u8303\u5f0f\uff08bypass pruning\uff09\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u672a\u9009\u4e2d\u7684\u89c6\u89c9token\u5e76\u4f20\u9012\u81f3\u540e\u7eed\u9636\u6bb5\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u5b9a\u5c42\uff08\u5177\u5f3atoken\u9009\u62e9\u80fd\u529b\uff09\u6267\u884c\u526a\u679d\uff0c\u5206\u5c42\u72ec\u7acb\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "result": "SwiftVLM\u5728\u591a\u4e2aVLM\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6-\u6548\u7387\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9token\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65c1\u8def\u526a\u679d\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u8de8\u5c42\u52a8\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30token\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u526a\u679d\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

As a hardware-agnostic and highly compatible technique, low-rank compression has been widely adopted. However, existing methods typically compress each layer independently by minimizing per-layer reconstruction error, overlooking a critical limitation: the reconstruction error propagates and accumulates through the network, which leads to amplified global deviations from the full-precision baseline. To address this, we propose Self-Adaptive Error Suppression SVD (SAES-SVD), a LLMs compression framework that jointly optimizes intra-layer reconstruction and inter-layer error compensation. SAES-SVD is composed of two novel components: (1) Cumulative Error-Aware Layer Compression (CEALC), which formulates the compression objective as a combination of local reconstruction and weighted cumulative error compensation. Based on it, we derive a closed-form low-rank solution relied on second-order activation statistics, which explicitly aligns each layer's output with its full-precision counterpart to compensate for accumulated errors. (2) Adaptive Collaborative Error Suppression (ACES), which automatically adjusts the weighting coefficient to enhance the low-rank structure of the compression objective in CEALC. Specifically, the coefficient is optimized to maximize the ratio between the Frobenius norm of the compressed layer's output and that of the compression objective under a fixed rank, thus ensuring that the rank budget is utilized effectively.

However, the potential for a bidirectional process--where insights from post-training retroactively improve the pre-trained foundation--remains unexplored. We aim to establish a self-reinforcing flywheel: a cycle in which reinforcement learning (RL)-tuned model strengthens the base model, which in turn enhances subsequent post-training performance, requiring no specially trained teacher or reference model. To realize this, we analyze training dynamics and identify the mid-training (annealing) phase as a critical turning point for model capabilities. This phase typically occurs at the end of pre-training, utilizing high-quality corpora under a rapidly decaying learning rate. Building upon this insight, we introduce ReMiT (Reinforcement Learning-Guided Mid-Training). Specifically, ReMiT leverages the reasoning priors of RL-tuned models to dynamically reweight tokens during the mid-training phase, prioritizing those pivotal for reasoning. Empirically, ReMiT achieves an average improvement of 3\\% on 10 pre-training benchmarks, spanning math, code, and general reasoning, and sustains these gains by over 2\\% throughout the post-training pipeline. These results validate an iterative feedback loop, enabling continuous and self-reinforcing evolution of LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u53c2\u8003\u6a21\u578b\u7684LLM\u53cc\u5411\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6ReMiT\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u4e2d\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u52a0\u6743\u5173\u952e\u63a8\u7406token\uff0c\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5747\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfLLM\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\u5355\u5411\uff08\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u2192\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff09\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4ece\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u53cd\u9988\u4f18\u5316\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u673a\u5236\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u5f3a\u5316\u5faa\u73af\uff08flywheel\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u8fed\u4ee3\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u5916\u90e8\u4f9d\u8d56\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u8bc6\u522b\u5230\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u671f\u9636\u6bb5\uff08\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u8f6c\u6298\u70b9\uff09\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u7a97\u53e3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7RL\u8c03\u6821\u540e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5728\u8be5\u9636\u6bb5\u5bf9token\u8fdb\u884c\u52a8\u6001\u52a0\u6743\uff0c\u4f18\u5148\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u3002\u7b97\u6cd5\u547d\u540d\u4e3aReMiT\u3002", "result": "\u572810\u9879\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u53473%\uff08\u6570\u5b66\u3001\u4ee3\u7801\u548c\u901a\u7528\u63a8\u7406\u573a\u666f\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u540e\u7eed\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6027\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u8d852%\u7684\u589e\u76ca\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u53cd\u9988\u5faa\u73af\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u81ea\u5f3a\u5316\u7279\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86LLM\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u6211\u8fed\u4ee3\uff08mid-training\u52a8\u6001token\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u4e3b\u8fdb\u5316\uff0c\u4e3a\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u5916\u90e8\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

This human-in-the-loop adaptation is employed in a group-activity video retrieval framework to improve its retrieval performance. Our method initially pre-trains the GAF space based on the similarity of group activities in a self-supervised manner, unlike prior work that classifies videos into pre-defined group activity classes in a supervised learning manner. Our interactive fine-tuning process updates the GAF space to allow a user to better retrieve videos similar to query videos given by the user. In this fine-tuning, our proposed data-efficient video selection process provides several videos, which are selected from a video database, to the user in order to manually label these videos as positive or negative. These labeled videos are used to update (i.e., fine-tune) the GAF space, so that the positive and negative videos move closer to and farther away from the query videos through contrastive learning. Our comprehensive experimental results on two team sports datasets validate that our method significantly improves the retrieval performance. Ablation studies also demonstrate that several components in our human-in-the-loop adaptation contribute to the improvement of the retrieval performance.

Specifically, a Global Coordinate Estimation module is first introduced to predict point-wise global coordinates and associated uncertainties for each LiDAR scan. A Prior Coordinate Generation module is then presented to estimate inter-frame point correspondences by the attention mechanism. Lastly, an Uncertainty-Guided Coordinate Fusion module is deployed to integrate both predictions of point correspondence in an end-to-end fashion, yielding a more temporally consistent and accurate global 6-DoF pose.

Although world models provide a cost-effective solution for generating realistic driving data, they often suffer from identity drift, where the same object changes its appearance or category across frames due to the absence of instance-level temporal constraints. We introduce ConsisDrive, an identity-preserving driving world model designed to enforce temporal consistency at the instance level. Our framework incorporates two key components: (1) Instance-Masked Attention, which applies instance identity masks and trajectory masks within attention blocks to ensure that visual tokens interact only with their corresponding instance features across spatial and temporal dimensions, thereby preserving object identity consistency; and (2) Instance-Masked Loss, which adaptively emphasizes foreground regions with probabilistic instance masking, reducing background noise while maintaining overall scene fidelity. By integrating these mechanisms, ConsisDrive achieves state-of-the-art driving video generation quality and demonstrates significant improvements in downstream autonomous driving tasks on the nuScenes dataset.

To address this bottleneck, the token pruning paradigm leverages attention sparsity to selectively retain a small, critical subset of tokens. However, existing approaches fall short, with static methods risking irreversible information loss and dynamic strategies employing heuristics that insufficiently capture the query-dependent nature of token importance. We propose FASA, a novel framework that achieves query-aware token eviction by dynamically predicting token importance. FASA stems from a novel insight into RoPE: the discovery of functional sparsity at the frequency-chunk (FC) level. Our key finding is that a small, identifiable subset of \"dominant\" FCs consistently exhibits high contextual agreement with the full attention head. This provides a robust and computationally free proxy for identifying salient tokens. %making them a powerful and efficient proxy for token importance. Building on this insight, FASA first identifies a critical set of tokens using dominant FCs, and then performs focused attention computation solely on this pruned subset. % Since accessing only a small fraction of the KV cache, FASA drastically lowers memory bandwidth requirements and computational cost. Across a spectrum of long-context tasks, from sequence modeling to complex CoT reasoning, FASA consistently outperforms all token-eviction baselines and achieves near-oracle accuracy, demonstrating remarkable robustness even under constraint budgets.

We identify this directional constraint as a fundamental limitation of the standard axial 2D RoPE, which hinders the modeling of oblique spatial relationships that naturally exist in natural images. To overcome this limitation, we propose Spiral RoPE, a simple yet effective extension that enables multi-directional positional encoding by partitioning embedding channels into multiple groups associated with uniformly distributed directions. Each group is rotated according to the projection of the patch position onto its corresponding direction, allowing spatial relationships to be encoded beyond the horizontal and vertical axes. Across a wide range of vision tasks including classification, segmentation, and generation, Spiral RoPE consistently improves performance.

To better balance efficiency and performance, we introduce ForesightKV, a training-based KV cache eviction framework that learns to predict which KV pairs to evict during long-text generations.

Prior acceleration methods either sparsify the attention map with structured patterns or permanently evict tokens at specific layers, which can retain irrelevant tokens or rely on irreversible early decisions despite the layer-/head-wise dynamics of token importance. In this paper, we propose Token Sparse Attention, a lightweight and dynamic token-level sparsification mechanism that compresses per-head $Q$, $K$, $V$ to a reduced token set during attention and then decompresses the output back to the original sequence, enabling token information to be reconsidered in subsequent layers. Furthermore, Token Sparse Attention exposes a new design point at the intersection of token selection and sparse attention. Our approach is fully compatible with dense attention implementations, including Flash Attention, and can be seamlessly composed with existing sparse attention kernels. Experimental results show that Token Sparse Attention consistently improves accuracy-latency trade-off, achieving up to $\\times$3.23 attention speedup at 128K context with less than 1% accuracy degradation.

While world models offer a cost-effective solution for generating realistic driving videos, they struggle to maintain instance-level temporal consistency and spatial geometric fidelity. To address these challenges, we propose InstaDrive, a novel framework that enhances driving video realism through two key advancements: (1) Instance Flow Guider, which extracts and propagates instance features across frames to enforce temporal consistency, preserving instance identity over time. (2) Spatial Geometric Aligner, which improves spatial reasoning, ensures precise instance positioning, and explicitly models occlusion hierarchies. By incorporating these instance-aware mechanisms, InstaDrive achieves state-of-the-art video generation quality and enhances downstream autonomous driving tasks on the nuScenes dataset. Additionally, we utilize CARLA's autopilot to procedurally and stochastically simulate rare but safety-critical driving scenarios across diverse maps and regions, enabling rigorous safety evaluation for autonomous systems.

Furthermore, standard systems cannot perform \"blind\" localization from verbal descriptions alone, a capability needed for applications such as emergency response. To address these challenges, we introduce LaVPR, a large-scale benchmark that extends existing VPR datasets with over 650,000 rich natural-language descriptions. Using LaVPR, we investigate two paradigms: Multi-Modal Fusion for enhanced robustness and Cross-Modal Retrieval for language-based localization. Our results show that language descriptions yield consistent gains in visually degraded conditions, with the most significant impact on smaller backbones. Notably, adding language allows compact models to rival the performance of much larger vision-only architectures. For cross-modal retrieval, we establish a baseline using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Multi-Similarity loss, which substantially outperforms standard contrastive methods across vision-language models.

However, their deployment is hindered by significant computational costs. Existing structured pruning methods, while hardware-efficient, often suffer from significant accuracy degradation. In this paper, we argue that this failure stems from a stage-agnostic pruning approach that overlooks the asymmetric roles between the prefill and decode stages. By introducing a virtual gate mechanism, our importance analysis reveals that deep layers are critical for next-token prediction (decode) but largely redundant for context encoding (prefill). Leveraging this insight, we propose Prefill-Only Pruning (POP), a stage-aware inference strategy that safely omits deep layers during the computationally intensive prefill stage while retaining the full model for the sensitive decode stage. To enable the transition between stages, we introduce independent Key-Value (KV) projections to maintain cache integrity, and a boundary handling strategy to ensure the accuracy of the first generated token.

This is especially pronounced in medical image analysis, where data is often scarce and covariate shifts arise from different hardware devices, imaging protocols, and heterogeneous patient populations. These factors collectively hinder reliable performance and slow down clinical adoption. Despite recent progress, existing learning paradigms primarily rely on the Euclidean manifold, whose flat geometry fails to capture the complex, hierarchical structures present in clinical data. In this work, we exploit the advantages of hyperbolic manifolds to model complex data characteristics. We present the first comprehensive validation of hyperbolic representation learning for medical image analysis and demonstrate statistically significant gains across eleven in-distribution datasets and three ViT models. We further propose an unsupervised, domain-invariant hyperbolic cross-branch consistency constraint. Extensive experiments confirm that our proposed method promotes domain-invariant features and outperforms state-of-the-art Euclidean methods by an average of $+2.1\\%$ AUC on three domain generalization benchmarks: Fitzpatrick17k, Camelyon17-WILDS, and a cross-dataset setup for retinal imaging.

While large language models (LLMs) can automatically translate natural language into optimization models, existing approaches either rely on costly post-training or employ multi-agent frameworks, yet most still lack reliable collaborative error correction and task-specific retrieval, often leading to incorrect outputs. We propose MIRROR, a fine-tuning-free, end-to-end multi-agent framework that directly translates natural language optimization problems into mathematical models and solver code. MIRROR integrates two core mechanisms: (1) execution-driven iterative adaptive revision for automatic error correction, and (2) hierarchical retrieval to fetch relevant modeling and coding exemplars from a carefully curated exemplar library. Experiments show that MIRROR outperforms existing methods on standard OR benchmarks, with notable results on complex industrial datasets such as IndustryOR and Mamo-ComplexLP. By combining precise external knowledge infusion with systematic error correction, MIRROR provides non-expert users with an efficient and reliable OR modeling solution, overcoming the fundamental limitations of general-purpose LLMs in expert optimization tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6MIRROR\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u7ea0\u9519\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u68c0\u7d22\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5c06\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u76f4\u63a5\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u6570\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u6c42\u89e3\u4ee3\u7801\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8fd0\u7b79\u5b66\u5efa\u6a21\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e13\u5bb6\u624b\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u73b0\u6709LLM\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u9700\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u9760\u7ea0\u9519\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8f93\u51fa\u8d28\u91cf\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "MIRROR\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u5927\u521b\u65b0\uff1a(1)\u6267\u884c\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4fee\u8ba2\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u9519\u8bef\u6821\u6b63\uff1b(2)\u5206\u5c42\u68c0\u7d22\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ece\u7cbe\u9009\u793a\u4f8b\u5e93\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u7f16\u7801\u8303\u4f8b\u3002", "result": "\u5728IndustryOR\u548cMamo-ComplexLP\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u5de5\u4e1a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cMIRROR\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8f83\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u4e14\u5b8c\u5168\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u53c2\u6570\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5916\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u6ce8\u5165\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea0\u9519\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4e3a\u975e\u4e13\u5bb6\u7528\u6237\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8fd0\u7b79\u5b66\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u901a\u7528LLM\u5728\u4e13\u5bb6\u4f18\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6839\u672c\u6027\u5c40\u9650\u3002"}}

This focus has shaped both training objectives and evaluation protocols, implicitly treating global geometry as a proxy for representational competence. While global geometry effectively encodes which elements are present, it is often insensitive to how they are composed. We investigate this limitation by testing the ability of geometric metrics to predict compositional binding across 21 vision encoders. We find that standard geometry-based statistics exhibit near-zero correlation with compositional binding. In contrast, functional sensitivity, as measured by the input-output Jacobian, reliably tracks this capability. We further provide an analytic account showing that this disparity arises from objective design, as existing losses explicitly constrain embedding geometry but leave the local input-output mapping unconstrained. These results suggest that global embedding geometry captures only a partial view of representational competence and establish functional sensitivity as a critical complementary axis for modeling composite structure.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u8868\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u4f9d\u8d56\u5d4c\u5165\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u63cf\u8ff0\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\u65f6\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u529f\u80fd\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff08\u8f93\u5165\u8f93\u51fa\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6307\u6807\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u8d28\u7591\u5f53\u524d\u8868\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u5168\u5c40\u5d4c\u5165\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u8ba4\u4e3a\u8fd9\u79cd\u6307\u6807\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u5143\u7d20\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u9700\u63a2\u7d22\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ef4\u5ea6", "method": "\u5bf921\u79cd\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u4f20\u7edf\u51e0\u4f55\u6307\u6807\u4e0e\u529f\u80fd\u654f\u611f\u6027\u7684\u5173\u8054\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8fdb\u884c\u7406\u8bba\u63a8\u5bfc", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4f20\u7edf\u51e0\u4f55\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\u4e0e\u7ec4\u5408\u7ed1\u5b9a\u80fd\u529b\u51e0\u4e4e\u65e0\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff08\u8fd1\u96f6\u76f8\u5173\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u8f93\u5165\u8f93\u51fa\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u6307\u6807\u8868\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u63a8\u5bfc\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u8fd9\u4e00\u5dee\u5f02", "conclusion": "\u5168\u5c40\u5d4c\u5165\u51e0\u4f55\u4ec5\u90e8\u5206\u53cd\u6620\u8868\u5f81\u5b8c\u5907\u6027\uff0c\u529f\u80fd\u654f\u611f\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u7684\u8865\u507f\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u5e94\u5173\u6ce8\u5c40\u90e8\u8f93\u5165\u8f93\u51fa\u6620\u5c04\u5173\u7cfb"}}

We show that a binary LLM critic with strong offline accuracy (AUROC 0.94) can nevertheless cause severe performance degradation, inducing a 26 percentage point (pp) collapse on one model while affecting another by near zero pp. This variability demonstrates that LLM critic accuracy alone is insufficient to determine whether intervention is safe.\n  We identify a disruption-recovery tradeoff: interventions may recover failing trajectories but also disrupt trajectories that would have succeeded. Based on this insight, we propose a pre-deployment test that uses a small pilot of 50 tasks to estimate whether intervention is likely to help or harm, without requiring full deployment.

Among existing TTA strategies, pseudo-label-based methods have shown promising performance. However, they often rely on perturbation-ensemble heuristics (e.g., dropout sampling, test-time augmentation, Gaussian noise), which lack distributional grounding and yield unstable training signals. This can trigger error accumulation and catastrophic forgetting during adaptation. To address this, we propose \\textbf{A3-TTA}, a TTA framework that constructs reliable pseudo-labels through anchor-guided supervision. Specifically, we identify well-predicted target domain images using a class compact density metric, under the assumption that confident predictions imply distributional proximity to the source domain. These anchors serve as stable references to guide pseudo-label generation, which is further regularized via semantic consistency and boundary-aware entropy minimization. Additionally, we introduce a self-adaptive exponential moving average strategy to mitigate label noise and stabilize model update during adaptation. Evaluated on both multi-domain medical images (heart structure and prostate segmentation) and natural images, A3-TTA significantly improves average Dice scores by 10.40 to 17.68 percentage points compared to the source model, outperforming several state-of-the-art TTA methods under different segmentation model architectures. A3-TTA also excels in continual TTA, maintaining high performance across sequential target domains with strong anti-forgetting ability.

A task-specific weighting scheme further balances the contributions of translation and post-editing objectives, yielding a biased yet more sample-efficient estimator.

The most popular state-of-the-art visual-inertial odometry (VIO) systems, however, are too computationally demanding for resource-constrained hardware, such as micro-drones and smart glasses. This work presents LEVIO, a fully featured VIO pipeline optimized for ultra-low-power compute platforms, allowing six-degrees-of-freedom (DoF) real-time sensing. LEVIO incorporates established VIO components such as Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (ORB) feature tracking and bundle adjustment, while emphasizing a computationally efficient architecture with parallelization and low memory usage to suit embedded microcontrollers and low-power systems-on-chip (SoCs). The paper proposes and details the algorithmic design choices and the hardware-software co-optimization approach, and presents real-time performance on resource-constrained hardware. LEVIO is validated on a parallel-processing ultra-low-power RISC-V SoC, achieving 20 FPS while consuming less than 100 mW, and benchmarked against public VIO datasets, offering a compelling balance between efficiency and accuracy.

FOCUS sequentially performs image quality assessment with EfficientNetV2-S, followed by abnormality detection and multi-disease classification using a fine-tuned Vision Foundation Model. Crucially, FOCUS leverages a unified adaptive aggregation method to intelligently integrate 2D slices-level predictions into comprehensive 3D patient-level diagnosis. Trained and tested on 3,300 patients (40,672 slices), and externally validated on 1,345 patients (18,498 slices) across four different-tier centers and diverse OCT devices, FOCUS achieved high F1 scores for quality assessment (99.01%), abnormally detection (97.46%), and patient-level diagnosis (94.39%). Real-world validation across centers also showed stable performance (F1: 90.22%-95.24%). In human-machine comparisons, FOCUS matched expert performance in abnormality detection (F1: 95.47% vs 90.91%) and multi-disease diagnosis (F1: 93.49% vs 91.35%), while demonstrating better efficiency.

Existing defenses focus exclusively on text-based distillation, leaving the important logit-based distillation largely unexplored. In this work, we analyze this problem and present an effective solution from an information-theoretic perspective. We characterize distillation-relevant information in teacher outputs using the conditional mutual information (CMI) between teacher logits and input queries conditioned on ground-truth labels. This quantity captures contextual information beneficial for model extraction, motivating us to defend distillation via CMI minimization. Guided by our theoretical analysis, we propose learning a transformation matrix that purifies the original outputs to enhance distillation resistance.

At the same time, in practical applications, generative data augmentation can be vulnerable to clean-label backdoor attacks, which aim to bypass human inspection. However, based on theoretical analysis and preliminary experiments, we observe that directly applying existing pixel-level clean-label backdoor attack methods (e.g., COMBAT) to generated images results in low attack success rates. This motivates us to move beyond pixel-level triggers and focus instead on the latent feature level. To this end, we propose InvLBA, an invisible clean-label backdoor attack method for generative data augmentation by latent perturbation. We theoretically prove that the generalization of the clean accuracy and attack success rates of InvLBA can be guaranteed.

However, existing RAG systems fail to leverage these capabilities. They still rely on two paradigms: (1) designing an algorithm that retrieves passages in a single shot and concatenates them into the model's input, or (2) predefining a workflow and prompting the model to execute it step-by-step. Neither paradigm allows the model to participate in retrieval decisions, preventing efficient scaling with model improvements. In this paper, we introduce A-RAG, an Agentic RAG framework that exposes hierarchical retrieval interfaces directly to the model. A-RAG provides three retrieval tools: keyword search, semantic search, and chunk read, enabling the agent to adaptively search and retrieve information across multiple granularities. Experiments on multiple open-domain QA benchmarks show that A-RAG consistently outperforms existing approaches with comparable or lower retrieved tokens, demonstrating that A-RAG effectively leverages model capabilities and dynamically adapts to different RAG tasks.

Current defensive approaches remain cumbersome, often requiring invasive model modifications, expensive training procedures or auxiliary data access. To address these threats, in this paper, we propose a plug-and-play and non-invasive defense mechanism in the spectral domain, grounded in a theoretical and empirical analysis of the relationship between imperceptible perturbations and high-frequency spectral components. Building upon these insights, we introduce a novel purification framework, termed PWAVEP, which begins by computing a spectral graph wavelet domain saliency score and local sparsity score for each point. Guided by these values, PWAVEP adopts a hierarchical strategy, it eliminates the most salient points, which are identified as hardly recoverable adversarial outliers. Simultaneously, it applies a spectral filtering process to a broader set of moderately salient points. This process leverages a graph wavelet transform to attenuate high-frequency coefficients associated with the targeted points, thereby effectively suppressing adversarial noise. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that the proposed PWAVEP achieves superior accuracy and robustness compared to existing approaches, advancing the state-of-the-art in 3D point cloud purification.

Note that the arXiv version is a pre-MIT Press publication version", "summary": "In this study, we investigate how language models develop preferences for \\textit{idiomatic} as compared to \\textit{linguistically acceptable} Swedish, both during pretraining and when adapting a model from English to Swedish. To do so, we train models on Swedish from scratch and by fine-tuning English-pretrained models, probing their preferences at various checkpoints using minimal pairs that differ in linguistic acceptability or idiomaticity. For linguistic acceptability, we adapt existing benchmarks into a minimal-pair format. To assess idiomaticity, we introduce two novel datasets: one contrasting conventionalized idioms with plausible variants, and another contrasting idiomatic Swedish with Translationese. Our findings suggest that idiomatic competence emerges more slowly than other linguistic abilities, including grammatical and lexical correctness. While longer training yields diminishing returns for most tasks, idiom-related performance continues to improve, particularly in the largest model tested (8B).

CompTok uses a token-conditioned diffusion decoder. By employing an InfoGAN-style objective, where we train a recognition model to predict the tokens used to condition the diffusion decoder using the decoded images, we enforce the decoder to not ignore any of the tokens. To promote compositional control, besides the original images, CompTok also trains on tokens formed by swapping token subsets between images, enabling more compositional control of the token over the decoder. As the swapped tokens between images do not have ground truth image targets, we apply a manifold constraint via an adversarial flow regularizer to keep unpaired swap generations on the natural-image distribution. The resulting tokenizer not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on image class-conditioned generation, but also demonstrates properties such as swapping tokens between images to achieve high level semantic editing of an image. Additionally, we propose two metrics that measures the landscape of the token space that can be useful to describe not only the compositionality of the tokens, but also how easy to learn the landscape is for a generator to be trained on this space.

This reveals a mismatch between how often self-verification is activated and how often it is actually useful. Motivated by this, we propose a novel, experience-driven test-time framework that reduces the overused verification. Our method detects the activation of recheck behavior, consults an offline experience pool of past verification outcomes, and estimates whether a recheck is likely unnecessary via efficient retrieval.

However, most RLVR pipelines rely on sparse outcome-based rewards, providing little supervision over intermediate steps and thus encouraging over-confidence and spurious reasoning, which in turn increases hallucinations. To address this, we propose FaithRL, a general reinforcement learning framework that directly optimizes reasoning faithfulness. We formalize a faithfulness-maximization objective and theoretically show that optimizing it mitigates over-confidence. To instantiate this objective, we introduce a geometric reward design and a faithfulness-aware advantage modulation mechanism that assigns step-level credit by penalizing unsupported steps while preserving valid partial derivations. Across diverse backbones and benchmarks, FaithRL consistently reduces hallucination rates while maintaining (and often improving) answer correctness. Further analysis confirms that FaithRL increases step-wise reasoning faithfulness and generalizes robustly.

To what extent can LLMs generalize across these representations? Here, we approach this question by studying isomorphic tasks involving procedures represented in code, graphs, and natural language (e.g., scheduling steps in planning). We find that training LLMs with popular post-training methods on graphs or code data alone does not reliably generalize to corresponding natural language tasks, while training solely on natural language can lead to inefficient performance gains. To address this gap, we propose a two-stage data curriculum that first trains on symbolic, then natural language data. The curriculum substantially improves model performance across model families and tasks. Remarkably, a 1.5B Qwen model trained by our method can closely match zero-shot GPT-4o in naturalistic planning. Finally, our analysis suggests that successful cross-representation generalization can be interpreted as a form of generative analogy, which our curriculum effectively encourages.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u3001\u56fe\u548c\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u793a\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u8868\u793a\u4efb\u52a1\u6548\u679c\uff0c1.5B Qwen\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63a5\u8fd1GPT-4o\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "LLMs\u901a\u5e38\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b26\u53f7\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5982\u4ee3\u7801\u3001\u56fe\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u4efb\u52a1\u4f9d\u8d56\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u3002\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7b26\u53f7\u4e0e\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u95f4\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0d\u8db3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6570\u636e\u8bfe\u7a0b\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u7528\u7b26\u53f7\u6570\u636e\uff08\u4ee3\u7801/\u56fe\uff09\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u8f6c\u5411\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u4efb\u52a1\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u8bad\u7ec3\u8def\u5f84\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8de8\u8868\u793a\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u5355\u7b26\u53f7/\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c1.5B Qwen\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u8ba1\u5212\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u903c\u8fd1GPT-4o\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4e14\u8de8\u8868\u793a\u8fc1\u79fb\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8de8\u8868\u793a\u6cdb\u5316\u672c\u8d28\u662f\u7c7b\u6bd4\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bfe\u7a0b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6709\u6548\u8bf1\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u7b26\u53f7\u4e0e\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u95f4\u7684\u7c7b\u6bd4\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

However, current methods exhibit suboptimal performance in service dialogues, as they rely on noisy, low-quality human conversation data. This limitation arises from data scarcity and the difficulty of simulating authentic, goal-oriented user behaviors. To address these issues, we propose SEAD (Self-Evolving Agent for Service Dialogue), a framework that enables agents to learn effective strategies without large-scale human annotations. SEAD decouples user modeling into two components: a Profile Controller that generates diverse user states to manage training curriculum, and a User Role-play Model that focuses on realistic role-playing.

Although significant progress has been made in existing methods, their optimization rely solely on the supervision from voxel labels and face the challenge of voxel sparsity as a large portion of voxels in autonomous driving scenarios are empty, which limits both optimization efficiency and model performance. To address this issue, we propose a \\textit{Multi-Resolution Alignment (MRA)} approach to mitigate voxel sparsity in camera-based 3D semantic scene completion, which exploits the scene and instance level alignment across multi-resolution 3D features as auxiliary supervision. Specifically, we first propose the Multi-resolution View Transformer module, which projects 2D image features into multi-resolution 3D features and aligns them at the scene level through fusing discriminative seed features. Furthermore, we design the Cubic Semantic Anisotropy module to identify the instance-level semantic significance of each voxel, accounting for the semantic differences of a specific voxel against its neighboring voxels within a cubic area. Finally, we devise a Critical Distribution Alignment module, which selects critical voxels as instance-level anchors with the guidance of cubic semantic anisotropy, and applies a circulated loss for auxiliary supervision on the critical feature distribution consistency across different resolutions.

Besides the obvious impact of uneven training resources, typological properties have also been proposed to determine the intrinsic difficulty of modeling a language. The existing evidence, however, is mostly based on small monolingual language models or bilingual translation models trained from scratch. We expand on this line of work by analyzing two large pre-trained multilingual translation models, NLLB-200 and Tower+, which are state-of-the-art representatives of encoder-decoder and decoder-only machine translation, respectively. Based on a broad set of languages, we find that target language typology drives translation quality of both models, even after controlling for more trivial factors, such as data resourcedness and writing script. Additionally, languages with certain typological properties benefit more from a wider search of the output space, suggesting that such languages could profit from alternative decoding strategies beyond the standard left-to-right beam search.

In this work, we first use a set of pilot experiments to show that in the supervised setting, the cross-entropy loss objective (CE) and the contrastive learning objective often conflict with each other, thus hindering the applications of CL in supervised settings. To resolve this problem, we introduce a novel \\underline{A}ligned \\underline{C}ontrastive \\underline{L}earning (ACL) framework. First, ACL-Embed regards label embeddings as extra augmented samples with different labels and employs contrastive learning to align the label embeddings with its samples' representations. Second, to facilitate the optimization of ACL-Embed objective combined with the CE loss, we propose ACL-Grad, which will discard the ACL-Embed term if the two objectives are in conflict. To further enhance the performances of intermediate exits of multi-exit BERT, we further propose cross-layer ACL (ACL-CL), which is to ask the teacher exit to guide the optimization of student shallow exits. Extensive experiments on the GLUE benchmark results in the following takeaways: (a) ACL-BRT outperforms or performs comparably with CE and CE+SCL on the GLUE tasks; (b) ACL, especially CL-ACL, significantly surpasses the baseline methods on the fine-tuning of multi-exit BERT, thus providing better quality-speed tradeoffs for low-latency applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u76d1\u7763\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684Aligned Contrastive Learning\uff08ACL\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542bACL-Embed\u3001ACL-Grad\u548cACL-CL\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\uff08CL\uff09\u4e0e\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u635f\u5931\uff08CE\uff09\u51b2\u7a81\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728GLUE\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u591a\u51fa\u53e3BERT\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u4f46\u76d1\u7763\u573a\u666f\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eCL\u4e0eCE\u635f\u5931\u76ee\u6807\u5b58\u5728\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u963b\u788dCL\u5728\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u534f\u8c03\u4e24\u8005\u3002", "method": "\u6838\u5fc3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1) ACL-Embed\u5c06\u6807\u7b7e\u5d4c\u5165\u89c6\u4e3a\u589e\u5f3a\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7CL\u5bf9\u9f50\u6807\u7b7e\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u8868\u5f81\uff1b2) ACL-Grad\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u51b2\u7a81\u65f6\u4e22\u5f03ACL-Embed\u9879\uff1b3) ACL-CL\u901a\u8fc7\u6559\u5e08\u51fa\u53e3\u5f15\u5bfc\u5b66\u751f\u6d45\u5c42\u51fa\u53e3\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "ACL-BRT\u5728GLUE\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8eCE\u548cCE+SCL\uff0cCL-ACL\u5728\u591a\u51fa\u53e3BERT\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u9ad8\u8d28\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "ACL\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u51b3CL-CE\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u5728\u76d1\u7763\u573a\u666f\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a81\u7834\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u51fa\u53e3BERT\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u65f6\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this by integrating external corpora, its effectiveness is limited by fragmented information in unstructured domain documents. Graph-augmented RAG (GraphRAG) emerged to enhance contextual reasoning through structured knowledge graphs, yet paradoxically underperforms vanilla RAG in real-world scenarios, exhibiting significant accuracy drops and prohibitive latency despite gains on complex queries. We identify the rigid application of GraphRAG to all queries, regardless of complexity, as the root cause. To resolve this, we propose an efficient and adaptive GraphRAG framework called EA-GraphRAG that dynamically integrates RAG and GraphRAG paradigms through syntax-aware complexity analysis. Our approach introduces: (i) a syntactic feature constructor that parses each query and extracts a set of structural features; (ii) a lightweight complexity scorer that maps these features to a continuous complexity score; and (iii) a score-driven routing policy that selects dense RAG for low-score queries, invokes graph-based retrieval for high-score queries, and applies complexity-aware reciprocal rank fusion to handle borderline cases.

However, their reliance on reconstruction-based training creates a fundamental conflict between the sharp, high-frequency attention maps of the encoder and the spatially consistent but blurry reconstruction maps of the decoder. We identify that this discrepancy gives rise to a vicious cycle: the noisy feature map from the encoder forces the decoder to average over possibilities and produce even blurrier outputs, while the gradient computed from blurry reconstruction maps lacks high-frequency details necessary to supervise encoder features. To break this cycle, we introduce Synergistic Representation Learning (SRL) that establishes a virtuous cycle where the encoder and decoder mutually refine one another. SRL leverages the encoder's sharpness to deblur the semantic boundary within the decoder output, while exploiting the decoder's spatial consistency to denoise the encoder's features. This mutual refinement process is stabilized by a warm-up phase with a slot regularization objective that initially allocates distinct entities per slot.

In the training of Large Language Models (LLMs) using Actor-Critic methods (e.g., PPO), this baseline is typically estimated by a Value Model (Critic) often as large as the policy model itself. However, as the policy continuously evolves, the value model requires expensive, synchronous incremental training to accurately track the shifting capabilities of the policy. To avoid this overhead, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) eliminates the coupled value model by using the average reward of a group of rollouts as the baseline; yet, this approach necessitates extensive sampling to maintain estimation stability. In this paper, we propose $V_0$, a Generalist Value Model capable of estimating the expected performance of any model on unseen prompts without requiring parameter updates. We reframe value estimation by treating the policy's dynamic capability as an explicit context input; specifically, we leverage a history of instruction-performance pairs to dynamically profile the model, departing from the traditional paradigm that relies on parameter fitting to perceive capability shifts. Focusing on value estimation at State Zero (i.e., the initial prompt, hence $V_0$), our model serves as a critical resource scheduler. During GRPO training, $V_0$ predicts success rates prior to rollout, allowing for efficient sampling budget allocation; during deployment, it functions as a router, dispatching instructions to the most cost-effective and suitable model. Empirical results demonstrate that $V_0$ significantly outperforms heuristic budget allocation and achieves a Pareto-optimal trade-off between performance and cost in LLM routing tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa$V_0$\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u901a\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u5386\u53f2\u8868\u73b0\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1\u521d\u59cb\u72b6\u6001\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edfActor-Critic\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u7684Critic\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u9ad8\u6548\u5206\u914d\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfActor-Critic\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2dCritic\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u4e0e\u7b56\u7565\u6a21\u578b\u540c\u6b65\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff1bGRPO\u867d\u907f\u514d\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u4f46\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u91cf\u91c7\u6837\u3002$V_0$\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u96f6\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u4f30\u8ba1\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u5f00\u9500\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u91c7\u6837\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "$V_0$\u5c06\u7b56\u7565\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6027\u80fd\u4f5c\u4e3a\u663e\u5f0f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5386\u53f2\u6307\u4ee4-\u6027\u80fd\u5bf9\u52a8\u6001\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4f30\u8ba1\u521d\u59cb\u72b6\u6001\uff08State Zero\uff09\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u53c2\u6570\u62df\u5408\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7b56\u7565\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "$V_0$\u5728GRPO\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u9884\u7b97\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u5728LLM\u8def\u7531\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u6700\u4f18\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5e76\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u91c7\u6837\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "$V_0$\u901a\u8fc7\u6d88\u9664Critic\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8026\u5408\u66f4\u65b0\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u8c03\u5ea6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u6027\u4ef7\u6bd4\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u4ef7\u503c\u4f30\u8ba1\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

However, real-world tasks are far more complex and context-dependent: models must learn from task-specific context and leverage new knowledge beyond what is learned during pre-training to reason and resolve tasks. We term this capability context learning, a crucial ability that humans naturally possess but has been largely overlooked. To this end, we introduce CL-bench, a real-world benchmark consisting of 500 complex contexts, 1,899 tasks, and 31,607 verification rubrics, all crafted by experienced domain experts. Each task is designed such that the new content required to resolve it is contained within the corresponding context. Resolving tasks in CL-bench requires models to learn from the context, ranging from new domain-specific knowledge, rule systems, and complex procedures to laws derived from empirical data, all of which are absent from pre-training. This goes far beyond long-context tasks that primarily test retrieval or reading comprehension, and in-context learning tasks, where models learn simple task patterns via instructions and demonstrations. Our evaluations of ten frontier LMs find that models solve only 17.2% of tasks on average. Even the best-performing model, GPT-5.1, solves only 23.7%, revealing that LMs have yet to achieve effective context learning, which poses a critical bottleneck for tackling real-world, complex context-dependent tasks.

PCSP serves as a generalization of the well-known Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP). In the CSP framework, we define a set of variables, a set of constraints, and a finite domain $D$ that encompasses all possible values for each variable. The objective is to assign a value to each variable in such a way that all constraints are satisfied. In the graph variant of CSP, an underlying graph is considered and we have one variable corresponding to each vertex of the graph and one or several constraints corresponding to each edge. In PCSPs, we allow for certain constraints to be violated at a specified cost, aiming to find a solution that minimizes the total cost. Numerous classical compiler optimization tasks can be framed as PCSPs over control-flow graphs. Examples include Register Allocation, Lifetime-optimal Speculative Partial Redundancy Elimination (LOSPRE), and Optimal Placement of Bank Selection Instructions. On the other hand, it is well-known that control-flow graphs of structured programs are sparse and decomposable in a variety of ways. In this work, we rely on the Series-Parallel-Loop (SPL) decompositions as introduced by~\\cite{RegisterAllocation}. Our main contribution is a general algorithm for PCSPs over SPL graphs with a time complexity of \\(O(|G| \\cdot |D|^6)\\), where \\(|G|\\) represents the size of the control-flow graph. Note that for any fixed domain $D,$ this yields a linear-time solution. Our algorithm can be seen as a generalization and unification of previous SPL-based approaches for register allocation and LOSPRE.

However, they often introduce visual hallucinations like over-optimized details and semantic misalignment. This work preliminarily explores why visual hallucinations arise and how to reduce them. We first investigate RFT methods from a unified perspective, and reveal the core problems stemming from two aspects, exploration and exploitation: (1) limited exploration during stochastic differential equation (SDE) rollouts, leading to an over-emphasis on local details at the expense of global semantics, and (2) trajectory imitation process inherent in policy gradient methods, distorting the model's foundational vector field and its cross-step consistency. Building on this, we propose ConsistentRFT, a general framework to mitigate these hallucinations. Specifically, we design a Dynamic Granularity Rollout (DGR) mechanism to balance exploration between global semantics and local details by dynamically scheduling different noise sources. We then introduce a Consistent Policy Gradient Optimization (CPGO) that preserves the model's consistency by aligning the current policy with a more stable prior.

At the conceptual level, we introduce a VAE dropout training strategy that randomly omits reference VAE features, encouraging the model to rely more on robust semantic signals from a Visual Language Model (VLM) and thereby promoting consistent concept-level generation in the absence of complete appearance cues. At the appearance level, we integrate the VLM-derived correspondences into a correspondence-aware masked attention module within the Diffusion Transformer (DiT).

In this paper, we propose a pipeline to train human-preference-aligned query-specific rubric generators tailored for DeepResearch report generation. We first construct a dataset of DeepResearch-style queries annotated with human preferences over paired reports, and train rubric generators via reinforcement learning with a hybrid reward combining human preference supervision and LLM-based rubric evaluation. To better handle long-horizon reasoning, we further introduce a Multi-agent Markov-state (MaMs) workflow for report generation. We empirically show that our proposed rubric generators deliver more discriminative and better human-aligned supervision than existing rubric design strategies.

However, task-irrelevant morphologies such as background clutter and sensor noise induce redundant activations (or anomalies). These anomalies expand activation ranges and skew activation distributions toward task-irrelevant responses, complicating bit allocation and weakening the preservation of informative features. Without a clear criterion to distinguish anomalies, suppressing them can inadvertently discard useful information. To address this, we present InlierQ, an inlier-centric post-training quantization approach that separates anomalies from informative inliers. InlierQ computes gradient-aware volume saliency scores, classifies each volume as an inlier or anomaly, and fits a posterior distribution over these scores using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. This design suppresses anomalies while preserving informative features. InlierQ is label-free, drop-in, and requires only 64 calibration samples.

It is fundamental to ensuring safety and reliability in real-world deployments. However, the underlying mechanisms governing this decision-making process remain poorly understood. In this paper, we investigate its working mechanism through an information flow lens. Our findings reveal that instruction tokens function as structural anchors for modality arbitration: Shallow attention layers perform non-selective information transfer, routing multimodal cues to these anchors as a latent buffer; Modality competition is resolved within deep attention layers guided by the instruction intent, while MLP layers exhibit semantic inertia, acting as an adversarial force.

To tackle LAC, we propose LogiCls, a vision-language framework that decomposes complex logical constraints into a sequence of verifiable subqueries. We further present a data-centric instruction synthesis pipeline that generates chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision for these subqueries, coupling precise grounding annotations with diverse image-text augmentations to adapt vision language models (VLMs) to logic-sensitive reasoning. Training is stabilized by a difficulty-aware resampling strategy that emphasizes challenging subqueries and long tail constraint types.

In contrast, linear attention model families provide a promising direction towards a more efficient sequential model. These linear attention models compress past KV values into a single hidden state, thereby efficiently reducing complexity during both training and inference. However, their expressivity remains limited by the size of their hidden state.

Nevertheless, the efficiency of these models remains bottlenecked by their softmax attention layers. In this paper, we propose Neural Attention Search Linear (NAtS-L), a framework that applies both linear attention and softmax attention operations within the same layer on different tokens. NAtS-L automatically determines whether a token can be handled by a linear attention model, i.e., tokens that have only short-term impact and can be encoded into fixed-size hidden states, or require softmax attention, i.e., tokens that contain information related to long-term retrieval and need to be preserved for future queries.

Project page: https://cyw-3d.github.io/PnP-U3D/", "summary": "The rapid progress of large multimodal models has inspired efforts toward unified frameworks that couple understanding and generation. While such paradigms have shown remarkable success in 2D, extending them to 3D remains largely underexplored. Existing attempts to unify 3D tasks under a single autoregressive (AR) paradigm lead to significant performance degradation due to forced signal quantization and prohibitive training cost. Our key insight is that the essential challenge lies not in enforcing a unified autoregressive paradigm, but in enabling effective information interaction between generation and understanding while minimally compromising their inherent capabilities and leveraging pretrained models to reduce training cost. Guided by this perspective, we present the first unified framework for 3D understanding and generation that combines autoregression with diffusion. Specifically, we adopt an autoregressive next-token prediction paradigm for 3D understanding, and a continuous diffusion paradigm for 3D generation. A lightweight transformer bridges the feature space of large language models and the conditional space of 3D diffusion models, enabling effective cross-modal information exchange while preserving the priors learned by standalone models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse 3D understanding and generation benchmarks, while also excelling in 3D editing tasks.

A key reason is that retrievers and rerankers optimize solely for relevance, often selecting either trivial, answer-revealing passages or evidence that lacks the critical information required to answer the question, without considering whether the evidence is suitable for the generator. We propose BAR-RAG, which reframes the reranker as a boundary-aware evidence selector that targets the generator's Goldilocks Zone -- evidence that is neither trivially easy nor fundamentally unanswerable for the generator, but is challenging yet sufficient for inference and thus provides the strongest learning signal. BAR-RAG trains the selector with reinforcement learning using generator feedback, and adopts a two-stage pipeline that fine-tunes the generator under the induced evidence distribution to mitigate the distribution mismatch between training and inference. Experiments on knowledge-intensive question answering benchmarks show that BAR-RAG consistently improves end-to-end performance under noisy retrieval, achieving an average gain of 10.3 percent over strong RAG and reranking baselines while substantially improving robustness.

In this work, we propose Constrained Dynamic Gaussian Splatting (CDGS), a novel framework that formulates dynamic scene reconstruction as a budget-constrained optimization problem to enforce a strict, user-defined Gaussian budget during training. Our key insight is to introduce a differentiable budget controller as the core optimization driver. Guided by a multi-modal unified importance score, this controller fuses geometric, motion, and perceptual cues for precise capacity regulation. To maximize the utility of this fixed budget, we further decouple the optimization of static and dynamic elements, employing an adaptive allocation mechanism that dynamically distributes capacity based on motion complexity. Furthermore, we implement a three-phase training strategy to seamlessly integrate these constraints, ensuring precise adherence to the target count. Coupled with a dual-mode hybrid compression scheme, CDGS not only strictly adheres to hardware constraints (error < 2%}) but also pushes the Pareto frontier of rate-distortion performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CDGS delivers optimal rendering quality under varying capacity limits, achieving over 3x compression compared to state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "CDGS\u89e3\u51b3\u52a8\u6001\u9ad8\u65af\u6cca\u677e\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u5185\u5b58-\u8d28\u91cf\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u7b97\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u65484D\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u914d\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u786c\u4ef6\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b03\u500d\u538b\u7f29\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u52a8\u6001\u9ad8\u65af\u6cca\u677e\u6280\u672f\u9762\u4e34\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u65e0\u7ea6\u675f\u5bc6\u96c6\u5316\u4f1a\u8d85\u51fa\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u5185\u5b58\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u800c\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u526a\u679d\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u9884\u8bbe\u9ad8\u65af\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u6700\u4f18\u6e32\u67d3\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u80fd\u4e25\u683c\u9075\u5faa\u7528\u6237\u9884\u7b97\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u538b\u7f29\u6548\u7387\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9884\u7b97\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6CDGS\uff0c\u521b\u65b0\u70b9\u5305\u542b\uff1a1) \u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u9884\u7b97\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u878d\u5408\u51e0\u4f55\u3001\u8fd0\u52a8\u3001\u611f\u77e5\u4fe1\u53f7\u751f\u6210\u7edf\u4e00\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\uff1b2) \u89e3\u8026\u9759\u6001/\u52a8\u6001\u5143\u7d20\u4f18\u5316\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u914d\u673a\u5236\uff1b3) \u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff1b4) \u53cc\u6a21\u5f0f\u6df7\u5408\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u786c\u4ef6\u8bef\u5dee<2%\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4SOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fbe\u62103\u500d\u538b\u7f29\u7387\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63a8\u8fdb\u7387\u5931\u771f\u6027\u80fdPareto\u524d\u6cbf\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5bb9\u91cf\u9650\u5236\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u6700\u4f18\u6e32\u67d3\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "CDGS\u9996\u6b21\u5c06\u9ad8\u65af\u9884\u7b97\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u4f18\u5316\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u5bb9\u91cf\u5206\u914d\u673a\u5236\u7a81\u7834\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u795e\u7ecf\u6e32\u67d3\u4e0e\u538b\u7f29\u6280\u672f\u4ea4\u53c9\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Benchmarking these models is crucial for assessing their reliability and practical robustness. Existing benchmarks mostly target high-resource languages and provide limited coverage for low-resource settings, such as Turkish. Moreover, existing studies on Turkish document parsing lack a standardized benchmark that reflects real-world scenarios and document diversity. To address this gap, we introduce OCRTurk, a Turkish document parsing benchmark covering multiple layout elements and document categories at three difficulty levels. OCRTurk consists of 180 Turkish documents drawn from academic articles, theses, slide decks, and non-academic articles. We evaluate seven OCR models on OCRTurk using element-wise metrics.

Recently, deep learning (DL) based segmentation models have shown the capacity to accomplish such a task. However, the training of the segmentation networks requires large amount of data with manual annotations, which is a major concern due to the data scarcity from clinic. Working with limited data is still common for researches on novel imaging modalities. To enhance the effectiveness of DL models trained with limited data, data augmentation (DA) is a crucial regularization technique. Traditional DA (TDA) strategies focus on basic intra-image operations, i.e. generating images with different orientations and intensity distributions. In contrast, the interimage and object-level DA operations are able to create new images from separate individuals. However, such DA strategies are not well explored on the task of multi-organ segmentation. In this paper, we investigated four possible inter-image DA strategies: CutMix, CarveMix, ObjectAug and AnatoMix, on two organ segmentation datasets. The result shows that CutMix, CarveMix and AnatoMix can improve the average dice score by 4.9, 2.0 and 1.9, compared with the state-of-the-art nnUNet without DA strategies. These results can be further improved by adding TDA strategies. It is revealed in our experiments that Cut-Mix is a robust but simple DA strategy to drive up the segmentation performance for multi-organ segmentation, even when CutMix produces intuitively 'wrong' images. Our implementation is publicly available for future benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u56db\u79cd\u8de8\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\uff08DA\uff09\u7b56\u7565\uff08CutMix\u3001CarveMix\u3001ObjectAug\u3001AnatoMix\uff09\u5728\u9650\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u7684\u591a\u5668\u5b98\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4f20\u7edfDA\u53d1\u73b0CutMix\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\u7ea64.9% Dice\u5206\u6570\u3002", "motivation": "\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u4e2d\u624b\u52a8\u6ce8\u91ca\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\uff08DL\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u9700\u63a2\u7d22\u65b0\u578b\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5c0f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5206\u5272\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u4e24\u5957\u5668\u5b98\u5206\u5272\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5CutMix\u3001CarveMix\u3001ObjectAug\u3001AnatoMix\u56db\u79cd\u8de8\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u5bf9\u8c61\u7ea7DA\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4f20\u7edfDA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08TDA\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "CutMix\u3001CarveMix\u3001AnatoMix\u5206\u522b\u5c06\u5e73\u5747Dice\u5206\u6570\u63d0\u53474.9%\u30012.0%\u30011.9%\uff0c\u53e0\u52a0TDA\u540e\u6548\u679c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\uff1bCutMix\u5373\u4f7f\u751f\u6210\u76f4\u89c2\u9519\u8bef\u56fe\u50cf\u4ecd\u80fd\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8de8\u56fe\u50cfDA\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662fCutMix\uff09\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u63d0\u4f9b\u7b80\u5355\u4e14\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u652f\u6301\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

To address this gap, we introduce ReQUESTA, a hybrid, multi-agent framework for generating cognitively diverse MCQs that systematically target text-based, inferential, and main idea comprehension. ReQUESTA decomposes MCQ authoring into specialized subtasks and coordinates LLM-powered agents with rule-based components to support planning, controlled generation, iterative evaluation, and post-processing. We evaluated the framework in a large-scale reading comprehension study using academic expository texts, comparing ReQUESTA-generated MCQs with those produced by a single-pass GPT-5 zero-shot baseline. Psychometric analyses of learner responses assessed item difficulty and discrimination, while expert raters evaluated question quality across multiple dimensions, including topic relevance and distractor quality. Results showed that ReQUESTA-generated items were consistently more challenging, more discriminative, and more strongly aligned with overall reading comprehension performance. Expert evaluations further indicated stronger alignment with central concepts and superior distractor linguistic consistency and semantic plausibility, particularly for inferential questions.

This limitation hinders the advancement of Vid-LLMs towards fine-grained video understanding. To address this issue, we introduce the SlowFocus mechanism, which significantly enhances the equivalent sampling frequency without compromising the quality of frame-level visual tokens. SlowFocus begins by identifying the query-related temporal segment based on the posed question, then performs dense sampling on this segment to extract local high-frequency features. A multi-frequency mixing attention module is further leveraged to aggregate these local high-frequency details with global low-frequency contexts for enhanced temporal comprehension. Additionally, to tailor Vid-LLMs to this innovative mechanism, we introduce a set of training strategies aimed at bolstering both temporal grounding and detailed temporal reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, we establish FineAction-CGR, a benchmark specifically devised to assess the ability of Vid-LLMs to process fine-grained temporal understanding tasks.

The issue is exacerbated in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), which generate lengthy chains of thought. While speculative decoding accelerates inference by drafting and verifying multiple tokens in parallel, existing methods operate at the token level and ignore semantic equivalence (i.e., different token sequences expressing the same meaning), leading to inefficient rejections. We propose SemanticSpec, a semantic-aware speculative decoding framework that verifies entire semantic sequences instead of tokens. SemanticSpec introduces a semantic probability estimation mechanism that probes the model's internal hidden states to assess the likelihood of generating sequences with specific meanings.Experiments on four benchmarks show that SemanticSpec achieves up to 2.7x speedup on DeepSeekR1-32B and 2.1x on QwQ-32B, consistently outperforming token-level and sequence-level baselines in both efficiency and effectiveness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51faSemanticSpec\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(LRM)\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u5176\u957f\u601d\u8003\u94fe\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u9ad8\u5ef6\u8fdf\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709token\u7ea7\u522b\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u65e0\u6cd5\u8bc6\u522b\u8bed\u4e49\u7b49\u4ef7\u5e8f\u5217\uff08\u4e0d\u540ctoken\u8868\u8fbe\u76f8\u540c\u542b\u4e49\uff09\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5927\u91cf\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u88ab\u9519\u8bef\u62d2\u7edd\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u521b\u65b0\u6027\u5f15\u5165\u8bed\u4e49\u6982\u7387\u4f30\u8ba1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a2\u67e5\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b8c\u6574\u8bed\u4e49\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ee5\u8bed\u4e49\u5355\u5143\u800c\u975etoken\u4e3a\u5355\u4f4d\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5728DeepSeekR1-32B\u548cQwQ-32B\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u5b9e\u73b02.7\u500d\u548c2.1\u500d\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u5168\u9762\u8d85\u8d8atoken/sequence\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6548\u679c\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u6700\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u6846\u67b6SemanticSpec\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u957f\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5197\u4f59\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u52a0\u901f\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

In this work, we study soft context compression, where a long context is condensed into a small set of continuous representations. Existing methods typically re-purpose the LLM itself as a trainable compressor, relying on layer-by-layer self-attention to iteratively aggregate information. We argue that this paradigm suffers from two structural limitations: (i) progressive representation overwriting across layers (ii) uncoordinated allocation of compression capacity across tokens. We propose ComprExIT (Context Compression via Explicit Information Transmission), a lightweight framework that formulates soft compression into a new paradigm: explicit information transmission over frozen LLM hidden states. This decouples compression from the model's internal self-attention dynamics. ComprExIT performs (i) depth-wise transmission to selectively transmit multi-layer information into token anchors, mitigating progressive overwriting, and (ii) width-wise transmission to aggregate anchors into a small number of slots via a globally optimized transmission plan, ensuring coordinated allocation of information.

However, this paradigm often suffers from severe visual redundancy and high computational overhead, especially when processing long videos. Crucially, existing keyframe selection strategies, especially those based on CLIP similarity, are prone to biases and may inadvertently overlook critical frames, resulting in suboptimal video comprehension. To address these significant challenges, we propose \\textbf{KTV}, a novel two-stage framework for efficient and effective training-free video understanding. In the first stage, KTV performs question-agnostic keyframe selection by clustering frame-level visual features, yielding a compact, diverse, and representative subset of frames that mitigates temporal redundancy. In the second stage, KTV applies key visual token selection, pruning redundant or less informative tokens from each selected keyframe based on token importance and redundancy, which significantly reduces the number of tokens fed into the LLM. Extensive experiments on the Multiple-Choice VideoQA task demonstrate that KTV outperforms state-of-the-art training-free baselines while using significantly fewer visual tokens, \\emph{e.g.}, only 504 visual tokens for a 60-min video with 10800 frames, achieving $44.8\\%$ accuracy on the MLVU-Test benchmark.

However, multimodal diagnosis in ophthalmic practice is typically challenged in terms of data heterogeneity, potential invasiveness, registration complexity, and so on. As such, a unified framework that integrates multimodal data synthesis and fusion is proposed for retinal disease classification and grading. Specifically, the synthesized multimodal data incorporates fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA), multispectral imaging (MSI), and saliency maps that emphasize latent lesions as well as optic disc/cup regions. Parallel models are independently trained to learn modality-specific representations that capture cross-pathophysiological signatures. These features are then adaptively calibrated within and across modalities to perform information pruning and flexible integration according to downstream tasks. The proposed learning system is thoroughly interpreted through visualizations in both image and feature spaces. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrated the superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art ones in the tasks of multi-label classification (F1-score: 0.683, AUC: 0.953) and diabetic retinopathy grading (Accuracy:0.842, Kappa: 0.861).

Based on these experiences, we extract common techniques for effective human-AI collaboration in theoretical research, such as iterative refinement, problem decomposition, and cross-disciplinary knowledge transfer. While the majority of our results stem from this interactive, conversational methodology, we also highlight specific instances that push beyond standard chat interfaces. These include deploying the model as a rigorous adversarial reviewer to detect subtle flaws in existing proofs, and embedding it within a \"neuro-symbolic\" loop that autonomously writes and executes code to verify complex derivations.

Existing efficiency methods primarily rely on local, per-trajectory signals and lack principled mechanisms to exploit global dynamics across parallel branches.

Our analysis reveals three key insights: non-monotonic scaling across width-depth allocations, heterogeneous reasoning branch lengths, and early stabilization of global consensus. Guided by these insights, we introduce $\\textbf{Parallel-Probe}$, a training-free controller designed to optimize online parallel thinking. Parallel-Probe employs consensus-based early stopping to regulate reasoning depth and deviation-based branch pruning to dynamically adjust width. Extensive experiments across three benchmarks and multiple models demonstrate that Parallel-Probe establishes a superior Pareto frontier for test-time scaling.

This is particularly crucial in the remote sensing domain, where the dense object distribution and a wide variety of categories contribute to prohibitively high costs. Based on the supervision level, existing oriented object detection algorithms can be broadly grouped into fully supervised, semi-supervised, and weakly supervised methods. Within the scope of this work, we further categorize them to include sparsely supervised and partially weakly-supervised methods. To address the challenges of large-scale labeling, we introduce the first Sparse Partial Weakly-Supervised Oriented Object Detection framework, designed to efficiently leverage only a few sparse weakly-labeled data and plenty of unlabeled data. Our framework incorporates three key innovations: (1) We design a Sparse-annotation-Orientation-and-Scale-aware Student (SOS-Student) model to separate unlabeled objects from the background in a sparsely-labeled setting, and learn orientation and scale information from orientation-agnostic or scale-agnostic weak annotations. (2) We construct a novel Multi-level Pseudo-label Filtering strategy that leverages the distribution of model predictions, which is informed by the model's multi-layer predictions. (3) We propose a unique sparse partitioning approach, ensuring equal treatment for each category. Extensive experiments on the DOTA and DIOR datasets show that our framework achieves a significant performance gain over traditional oriented object detection methods mentioned above, offering a highly cost-effective solution.

Although existing methods can generate full-body talking avatars with simple human motion, extending this task to grounded human-object interaction (GHOI) remains an open challenge, requiring the avatar to perform text-aligned interactions with surrounding objects. This challenge stems from the need for environmental perception and the control-quality dilemma in GHOI generation. To address this, we propose a novel dual-stream framework, InteractAvatar, which decouples perception and planning from video synthesis for grounded human-object interaction. Leveraging detection to enhance environmental perception, we introduce a Perception and Interaction Module (PIM) to generate text-aligned interaction motions. Additionally, an Audio-Interaction Aware Generation Module (AIM) is proposed to synthesize vivid talking avatars performing object interactions. With a specially designed motion-to-video aligner, PIM and AIM share a similar network structure and enable parallel co-generation of motions and plausible videos, effectively mitigating the control-quality dilemma. Finally, we establish a benchmark, GroundedInter, for evaluating GHOI video generation. Extensive experiments and comparisons demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in generating grounded human-object interactions for talking avatars.

Prior works typically rely on binary or pairwise supervision, which often fail to capture the continuous and pluralistic nature of human moral reasoning. We present MM-SCALE (Multimodal Moral Scale), a large-scale dataset for aligning VLMs with human moral preferences through 5-point scalar ratings and explicit modality grounding.

RIAS generates precise masks from text descriptions without manual thresholds and uses universal prompts to detect diverse anomalies with a single model. We introduce the MVTec-Ref dataset to support this, designed with diverse referring expressions and focusing on anomaly patterns, notably with 95% small anomalies. We also propose the Dual Query Token with Mask Group Transformer (DQFormer) benchmark, enhanced by Language-Gated Multi-Level Aggregation (LMA) to improve multi-scale segmentation. Unlike traditional methods using redundant queries, DQFormer employs only \"Anomaly\" and \"Background\" tokens for efficient visual-textual integration.

The first stage employs RAPID-SCAN (Resource-Aware Pipeline Inspection and Defect Segmentation using Compact Adaptive Network), achieving 0.834 F1-score with only 0.64M parameters for efficient defect segmentation. The second stage utilizes a fine-tuned Phi-3.5 VLM that generates concise, domain-specific summaries in natural language from the segmentation outputs. We introduce a curated dataset of inspection images with manually verified descriptions for VLM fine-tuning and evaluation. To enable real-time performance, we employ post-training quantization with hardware-specific optimization, achieving significant reductions in model size and inference latency without compromising summarization quality.

While effective over short horizons, these models often struggle with long-horizon generation, as small prediction errors accumulate over time. Prior methods alleviate this by introducing pre-trained teacher models and sequence-level distribution matching, which incur additional computational cost and fail to prevent error propagation beyond the training horizon. In this work, we propose LIVE, a Long-horizon Interactive Video world modEl that enforces bounded error accumulation via a novel cycle-consistency objective, thereby eliminating the need for teacher-based distillation. Specifically, LIVE first performs a forward rollout from ground-truth frames and then applies a reverse generation process to reconstruct the initial state.

Current professional workflows require tedious manual segmentation and the artistic ``hallucination'' of occluded regions to enable motion. Our approach overcomes this by decomposing a single image into fully inpainted, semantically distinct layers with inferred drawing orders. To address the scarcity of training data, we introduce a scalable engine that bootstraps high-quality supervision from commercial Live2D models, capturing pixel-perfect semantics and hidden geometry. Our methodology couples a diffusion-based Body Part Consistency Module, which enforces global geometric coherence, with a pixel-level pseudo-depth inference mechanism. This combination resolves the intricate stratification of anime characters, e.g., interleaving hair strands, allowing for dynamic layer reconstruction. We demonstrate that our approach yields high-fidelity, manipulatable models suitable for professional, real-time animation applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u9759\u6001\u52a8\u6f2b\u63d2\u753b\u81ea\u52a8\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u76842.5D\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u89e3\u56fe\u50cf\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5c42\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u624b\u52a8\u5206\u5272\u4e0e\u906e\u6321\u533a\u57df\u827a\u672f\u5316\u8865\u5168\u7684\u7e41\u7410\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u624b\u7ed8\u52a8\u753b\u5236\u4f5c\u9700\u8981\u7e41\u7410\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u5206\u5272\u548c\u906e\u6321\u533a\u57df\u7684\u827a\u672f\u6027\u8865\u5168\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u964d\u4f4e\u4e13\u4e1a\u52a8\u753b\u5236\u4f5c\u7684\u95e8\u69db\uff0c\u5e76\u89e3\u51b3\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5305\u542b\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684'\u8eab\u4f53\u90e8\u4f4d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6a21\u5757'\u548c'\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u4f2a\u6df1\u5ea6\u63a8\u65ad\u673a\u5236'\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u5f15\u64ce\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u76d1\u7763\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5546\u4e1aLive2D\u6a21\u578b\u6355\u83b7\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u9690\u85cf\u51e0\u4f55\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u52a8\u6f2b\u89d2\u8272\u590d\u6742\u5206\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u5982\u4ea4\u9519\u53d1\u4e1d\uff09\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u89e3\u6784\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u76842.5D\u6a21\u578b\u652f\u6301\u52a8\u6001\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u52a8\u753b\u5236\u4f5c\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u64cd\u7eb5\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63a5\u8fd1\u4e13\u4e1a\u6c34\u51c6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5355\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u52a8\u6f2b\u5206\u5c42\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u6027\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8d28\u91cf\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e13\u4e1a\u5b9e\u65f6\u52a8\u753b\u5e94\u7528\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4e3a\u975e\u4e13\u4e1a\u7528\u6237\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u52a8\u753b\u5236\u4f5c\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

We introduce Representation-Aligned Guidance (REPA-G), a framework that leverages these aligned representations, with rich semantic properties, to enable test-time conditioning from features in generation. By optimizing a similarity objective (the potential) at inference, we steer the denoising process toward a conditioned representation extracted from a pre-trained feature extractor. Our method provides versatile control at multiple scales, ranging from fine-grained texture matching via single patches to broad semantic guidance using global image feature tokens. We further extend this to multi-concept composition, allowing for the faithful combination of distinct concepts. REPA-G operates entirely at inference time, offering a flexible and precise alternative to often ambiguous text prompts or coarse class labels. We theoretically justify how this guidance enables sampling from the potential-induced tilted distribution. Quantitative results on ImageNet and COCO demonstrate that our approach achieves high-quality, diverse generations.

We propose a foveated vision interface (FOVI) based on the human retina and primary visual cortex, that reformats a variable-resolution retina-like sensor array into a uniformly dense, V1-like sensor manifold. Receptive fields are defined as k-nearest-neighborhoods (kNNs) on the sensor manifold, enabling kNN-convolution via a novel kernel mapping technique. We demonstrate two use cases: (1) an end-to-end kNN-convolutional architecture, and (2) a foveated adaptation of the foundational DINOv3 ViT model, leveraging low-rank adaptation (LoRA). These models provide competitive performance at a fraction of the computational cost of non-foveated baselines, opening pathways for efficient and scalable active sensing for high-resolution egocentric vision.

Intuitively, low-bit quantization is a prevalent and preferred technique for large-scale model compression. However, we find that a systematic analysis of VLA model's quantization is fundamentally lacking. We argue that naively applying uniform-bit quantization from Large Language Models (LLMs) to robotics is flawed, as these methods prioritize passive data fidelity while ignoring how minor action deviations compound into catastrophic task failures. To bridge this gap, we introduce QVLA, the first action-centric quantization framework specifically designed for embodied control. In a sharp departure from the rigid, uniform-bit quantization of LLM-based methods, QVLA introduces a highly granular, channel-wise bit allocation strategy. Its core mechanism is to directly measure the final action-space sensitivity when quantizing each individual channel to various bit-widths. This process yields a precise, per-channel importance metric that guides a global optimization, which elegantly unifies quantization and pruning (0-bit) into a single, cohesive framework. Extensive evaluations on different baselines demonstrate the superiority of our approach. In the LIBERO, the quantization version of OpenVLA-OFT with our method requires only 29.2% of the original model's VRAM while maintaining 98.9% of its original performance and achieving a 1.49x speedup. This translates to a 22.6% performance improvement over the LLM-derived method SmoothQuant.

However, brain shift invalidates the preoperative MRI after dural opening. Updated intraoperative brain MRI with brain shift compensation is crucial for enhancing the precision of neuronavigation systems and ensuring the optimal outcome of surgical interventions. Methodology: We propose NeuralShift, a U-Net-based model that predicts brain shift entirely from pre-operative MRI for patients undergoing temporal lobe resection. We evaluated our results using Target Registration Errors (TREs) computed on anatomical landmarks located on the resection side and along the midline, and DICE scores comparing predicted intraoperative masks with masks derived from intraoperative MRI. Results: Our experimental results show that our model can predict the global deformation of the brain (DICE of 0.97) with accurate local displacements (achieve landmark TRE as low as 1.12 mm), compensating for large brain shifts during temporal lobe removal neurosurgery. Conclusion: Our proposed model is capable of predicting the global deformation of the brain during temporal lobe resection using only preoperative images, providing potential opportunities to the surgical team to increase safety and efficiency of neurosurgery and better outcomes to patients.

In this work we examine a flexible, fixed ordering based on progressive checkerboards for multiscale autoregressive image generation. Our ordering draws samples in parallel from evenly spaced regions at each scale, maintaining full balance in all levels of a quadtree subdivision at each step. This enables effective conditioning both between and within scales.

Existing efforts in efficient training focus on reducing model sizes or trainable parameters. Inspired by the success of Visual Token Pruning (VTP) in improving inference efficiency, we are exploring another substantial research direction for efficient training by reducing visual tokens. However, applying VTP at the training stage results in a training-inference mismatch: pruning-trained models perform poorly when inferring on non-pruned full visual token sequences. To close this gap, we propose DualSpeed, a fast-slow framework for efficient training of MLLMs. The fast-mode is the primary mode, which incorporates existing VTP methods as plugins to reduce visual tokens, along with a mode isolator to isolate the model's behaviors. The slow-mode is the auxiliary mode, where the model is trained on full visual sequences to retain training-inference consistency. To boost its training, it further leverages self-distillation to learn from the sufficiently trained fast-mode. Together, DualSpeed can achieve both training efficiency and non-degraded performance. Experiments show DualSpeed accelerates the training of LLaVA-1.5 by 2.1$\\times$ and LLaVA-NeXT by 4.0$\\times$, retaining over 99% performance.

However, existing models lack a mechanism for smoothly controlling the intensity of text-guided edits. In standard text-conditioned generation, Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) impacts prompt adherence, suggesting it as a potential control for edit intensity in editing models. However, we show that scaling CFG in these models does not produce a smooth transition between the input and the edited result. We attribute this behavior to the unconditional prediction, which serves as the guidance origin and dominates the generation at low guidance scales, while representing an arbitrary manipulation of the input content. To enable continuous control, we introduce Adaptive-Origin Guidance (AdaOr), a method that adjusts this standard guidance origin with an identity-conditioned adaptive origin, using an identity instruction corresponding to the identity manipulation. By interpolating this identity prediction with the standard unconditional prediction according to the edit strength, we ensure a continuous transition from the input to the edited result. We evaluate our method on image and video editing tasks, demonstrating that it provides smoother and more consistent control compared to current slider-based editing approaches. Our method incorporates an identity instruction into the standard training framework, enabling fine-grained control at inference time without per-edit procedure or reliance on specialized datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper introduces Adaptive-Origin Guidance (AdaOr), a method for smooth intensity control in text-guided image/video editing by adjusting the guidance origin with identity-conditioned predictions, avoiding abrupt transitions seen in traditional Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) approaches.", "motivation": "Existing diffusion-based editing models struggle to smoothly adjust edit intensity via CFG.
