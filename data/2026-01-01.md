Abstract: Accurate Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) is critical for robotic surgery but remains fragile in specular, fluid-filled endoscopic environments. Existing self-supervised methods, typically relying on foundation models trained with noisy real-world pseudo-labels, often suffer from boundary collapse on thin surgical tools and transparent surfaces. In this work, we address this by leveraging the high-fidelity synthetic priors of the Depth Anything V2 architecture, which inherently captures precise geometric details of thin structures. We efficiently adapt these priors to the medical domain using Dynamic Vector Low-Rank Adaptation (DV-LORA), minimizing the parameter budget while bridging the synthetic-to-real gap. Additionally, we introduce a physically-stratified evaluation protocol on the SCARED dataset to rigorously quantify performance in high-specularity regimes often masked by aggregate metrics. Our approach establishes a new state-of-the-art, achieving an accuracy (< 1.25) of 98.1% and reducing Squared Relative Error by over 17% compared to established baselines, demonstrating superior robustness in adverse surgical lighting.

Conclusion: 该方法为军事训练提供低成本、实时、多维度的评估解决方案，显著提升评估客观性和可扩展性。未来将融合3D视频分析、改进遮挡处理算法，并探索在医疗手术培训等领域的迁移应用。

Abstract: Effective urban warfare training requires situational awareness and muscle memory, developed through repeated practice in realistic yet controlled environments. A key drill, Enter and Clear the Room (ECR), demands threat assessment, coordination, and securing confined spaces. The military uses Synthetic Training Environments that offer scalable, controlled settings for repeated exercises. However, automatic performance assessment remains challenging, particularly when aiming for objective evaluation of cognitive, psychomotor, and teamwork skills. Traditional methods often rely on costly, intrusive sensors or subjective human observation, limiting scalability and accuracy. This paper introduces a video-based assessment pipeline that derives performance analytics from training videos without requiring additional hardware. By utilizing computer vision models, the system extracts 2D skeletons, gaze vectors, and movement trajectories. From these data, we develop task-specific metrics that measure psychomotor fluency, situational awareness, and team coordination. These metrics feed into an extended Cognitive Task Analysis (CTA) hierarchy, which employs a weighted combination to generate overall performance scores for teamwork and cognition. We demonstrate the approach with a case study of real-world ECR drills, providing actionable, domain specific metrics that capture individual and team performance. We also discuss how these insights can support After Action Reviews with interactive dashboards within Gamemaster and the Generalized Intelligent Framework for Tutoring (GIFT), providing intuitive and understandable feedback. We conclude by addressing limitations, including tracking difficulties, ground-truth validation, and the broader applicability of our approach. Future work includes expanding analysis to 3D video data and leveraging video analysis to enable scalable evaluation within STEs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PFP is a neural network that compresses long videos into short contexts while preserving fine details in individual frames, enabling efficient memory storage for video models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of efficiently handling long video sequences by compressing them into manageable contexts without losing critical visual details.

Method: Introducing the PFP architecture with a pretraining objective focused on retaining high-frequency spatial details in frames at any temporal position.

Result: Compressed a 20-second video into a ~5k-length context, allowing retrieval of perceptually accurate frames and enabling low-cost, low-fidelity-loss memory encoding.

Conclusion: PFP achieves effective video compression with preserved frame quality, offering a practical trade-off between memory efficiency and fidelity in autoregressive video models.

Abstract: We present PFP, a neural network structure to compress long videos into short contexts, with an explicit pretraining objective to preserve the high-frequency details of single frames at arbitrary temporal positions. The baseline model can compress a 20-second video into a context at about 5k length, where random frames can be retrieved with perceptually preserved appearances. Such pretrained models can be directly fine-tuned as memory encoders for autoregressive video models, enabling long history memory with low context cost and relatively low fidelity loss. We evaluate the framework with ablative settings and discuss the trade-offs of possible neural architecture designs.

*Krithika Iyer,Austin Tapp,Athelia Paulli,Gabrielle Dickerson,Syed Muhammad Anwar,Natasha Lepore,Marius George Linguraru*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于深度学习的影像转换方法，利用儿童T1加权MRI生成合成CT（sCT），可精确分割颅骨和骨缝，为减少儿童辐射暴露提供了新方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CT存在辐射风险，儿科患者需避免；而MRI虽无辐射但无法显示颅骨骨缝细节。研究旨在通过影像合成技术解决这一矛盾，实现非侵入性颅骨发育评估。

Method: 构建深度学习流水线，包含特异性变分自编码器（VAE），将MRI转化为sCT，通过概率热力图预测骨缝分割，并使用等效性验证（TOST）评估结果。

Result: sCT图像与真实CT结构相似度达99%（Frechet距离1.01），颅骨分割Dice系数85%、骨缝分割80%，TOST验证显示两者等效性（p<0.05）。

Conclusion: 该框架首次实现基于MRI的儿科骨缝分割，填补了无创颅骨评估的技术空白，为临床替代CT检查提供了可能。

Abstract: Quantifying normative pediatric cranial development and suture ossification is crucial for diagnosing and treating growth-related cephalic disorders. Computed tomography (CT) is widely used to evaluate cranial and sutural deformities; however, its ionizing radiation is contraindicated in children without significant abnormalities. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers radiation free scans with superior soft tissue contrast, but unlike CT, MRI cannot elucidate cranial sutures, estimate skull bone density, or assess cranial vault growth. This study proposes a deep learning driven pipeline for transforming T1 weighted MRIs of children aged 0.2 to 2 years into synthetic CTs (sCTs), predicting detailed cranial bone segmentation, generating suture probability heatmaps, and deriving direct suture segmentation from the heatmaps. With our in-house pediatric data, sCTs achieved 99% structural similarity and a Frechet inception distance of 1.01 relative to real CTs. Skull segmentation attained an average Dice coefficient of 85% across seven cranial bones, and sutures achieved 80% Dice. Equivalence of skull and suture segmentation between sCTs and real CTs was confirmed using two one sided tests (TOST p < 0.05). To our knowledge, this is the first pediatric cranial CT synthesis framework to enable suture segmentation on sCTs derived from MRI, despite MRI's limited depiction of bone and sutures. By combining robust, domain specific variational autoencoders, our method generates perceptually indistinguishable cranial sCTs from routine pediatric MRIs, bridging critical gaps in non invasive cranial evaluation.

### [5] [Learning to learn skill assessment for fetal ultrasound scanning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23920)

Conclusion: 該框架提供了一種客觀、自動化的超音波技能評估方法，以任務表現指標替代傳統主觀評分，並能適應不同技能層級的複雜性。

Abstract: Traditionally, ultrasound skill assessment has relied on expert supervision and feedback, a process known for its subjectivity and time-intensive nature. Previous works on quantitative and automated skill assessment have predominantly employed supervised learning methods, often limiting the analysis to predetermined or assumed factors considered influential in determining skill levels. In this work, we propose a novel bi-level optimisation framework that assesses fetal ultrasound skills by how well a task is performed on the acquired fetal ultrasound images, without using manually predefined skill ratings. The framework consists of a clinical task predictor and a skill predictor, which are optimised jointly by refining the two networks simultaneously. We validate the proposed method on real-world clinical ultrasound videos of scanning the fetal head. The results demonstrate the feasibility of predicting ultrasound skills by the proposed framework, which quantifies optimised task performance as a skill indicator.

Conclusion: 该框架无需修改模型结构即可有效整合缺失模态信息，在保持分割精度的同时增强了临床适用性，代码已开源。

Abstract: Leveraging multimodal information from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) plays a vital role in lesion segmentation, especially for brain tumors. However, in clinical practice, multimodal MRI data are often incomplete, making it challenging to fully utilize the available information. Therefore, maximizing the utilization of this incomplete multimodal information presents a crucial research challenge. We present a novel meta-guided multi-modal learning (MGML) framework that comprises two components: meta-parameterized adaptive modality fusion and consistency regularization module. The meta-parameterized adaptive modality fusion (Meta-AMF) enables the model to effectively integrate information from multiple modalities under varying input conditions. By generating adaptive soft-label supervision signals based on the available modalities, Meta-AMF explicitly promotes more coherent multimodal fusion. In addition, the consistency regularization module enhances segmentation performance and implicitly reinforces the robustness and generalization of the overall framework. Notably, our approach does not alter the original model architecture and can be conveniently integrated into the training pipeline for end-to-end model optimization. We conducted extensive experiments on the public BraTS2020 and BraTS2023 datasets. Compared to multiple state-of-the-art methods from previous years, our method achieved superior performance. On BraTS2020, for the average Dice scores across fifteen missing modality combinations, building upon the baseline, our method obtained scores of 87.55, 79.36, and 62.67 for the whole tumor (WT), the tumor core (TC), and the enhancing tumor (ET), respectively. We have made our source code publicly available at https://github.com/worldlikerr/MGML.

### [7] [Kinematic-Based Assessment of Surgical Actions in Microanastomosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23942)
*Yan Meng,Daniel Donoho,Marcelle Altshuler,Omar Arnaout*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于AI的微血管吻合术技能自动化评估系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统人工评估存在主观性强、耗时长等局限，亟需客观且省时的自动化评估方案。

Method: 构建三层系统：1)YOLO+DeepSORT器械追踪 2)自相似矩阵动作分割 3)监督分类模型评估技能等级。

Result: 在58例手术视频验证中，动作分割准确率达92.4%，技能分类准确率85.5%。

Conclusion: 该AI系统能为显微外科培训提供实时客观反馈，推动标准化数据驱动教学。

Abstract: Proficiency in microanastomosis is a critical surgical skill in neurosurgery, where the ability to precisely manipulate fine instruments is crucial to successful outcomes. These procedures require sustained attention, coordinated hand movements, and highly refined motor skills, underscoring the need for objective and systematic methods to evaluate and enhance microsurgical training. Conventional assessment approaches typically rely on expert raters supervising the procedures or reviewing surgical videos, which is an inherently subjective process prone to inter-rater variability, inconsistency, and significant time investment. These limitations highlight the necessity for automated and scalable solutions. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel AI-driven framework for automated action segmentation and performance assessment in microanastomosis procedures, designed to operate efficiently on edge computing platforms. The proposed system comprises three main components: (1) an object tip tracking and localization module based on YOLO and DeepSORT; (2) an action segmentation module leveraging self-similarity matrix for action boundary detection and unsupervised clustering; and (3) a supervised classification module designed to evaluate surgical gesture proficiency. Experimental validation on a dataset of 58 expert-rated microanastomosis videos demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach, achieving a frame-level action segmentation accuracy of 92.4% and an overall skill classification accuracy of 85.5% in replicating expert evaluations. These findings demonstrate the potential of the proposed method to provide objective, real-time feedback in microsurgical education, thereby enabling more standardized, data-driven training protocols and advancing competency assessment in high-stakes surgical environments.

Method: 设计T2VAttack-S（同义词贪婪替换）和T2VAttack-I（最优词迭代插入）两种攻击方法，结合语义对齐与时间动态目标，在ModelScope等4个前沿模型上测试。

Result: 单个词语替换或添加即可使语义保真度和时序连贯性大幅下降，证明当前模型存在关键漏洞。

Conclusion: 文本到视频生成模型对对抗攻击敏感，需加强语义和时序鲁棒性设计以提升安全性。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Text-to-Video (T2V) diffusion models has driven remarkable advancements in generating high-quality, temporally coherent videos from natural language descriptions. Despite these achievements, their vulnerability to adversarial attacks remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce T2VAttack, a comprehensive study of adversarial attacks on T2V diffusion models from both semantic and temporal perspectives. Considering the inherently dynamic nature of video data, we propose two distinct attack objectives: a semantic objective to evaluate video-text alignment and a temporal objective to assess the temporal dynamics. To achieve an effective and efficient attack process, we propose two adversarial attack methods: (i) T2VAttack-S, which identifies semantically or temporally critical words in prompts and replaces them with synonyms via greedy search, and (ii) T2VAttack-I, which iteratively inserts optimized words with minimal perturbation to the prompt. By combining these objectives and strategies, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation on the adversarial robustness of several state-of-the-art T2V models, including ModelScope, CogVideoX, Open-Sora, and HunyuanVideo. Our experiments reveal that even minor prompt modifications, such as the substitution or insertion of a single word, can cause substantial degradation in semantic fidelity and temporal dynamics, highlighting critical vulnerabilities in current T2V diffusion models.

Conclusion: 提出了一种仅需图像输入的自动驾驶场景视图外推新框架，通过扩散模型与4D高斯的协同训练，有效克服了传统方法的数据依赖性，在降低成本的同时保证生成质量。

Abstract: This paper presents an effective solution for view extrapolation in autonomous driving scenarios. Recent approaches focus on generating shifted novel view images from given viewpoints using diffusion models. However, these methods heavily rely on priors such as LiDAR point clouds, 3D bounding boxes, and lane annotations, which demand expensive sensors or labor-intensive labeling, limiting applicability in real-world deployment. In this work, with only images and optional camera poses, we first estimate a global static point cloud and per-frame dynamic point clouds, fusing them into a unified representation. We then employ a deformable 4D Gaussian framework to reconstruct the scene. The initially trained 4D Gaussian model renders degraded and pseudo-images to train a video diffusion model. Subsequently, progressively shifted Gaussian renderings are iteratively refined by the diffusion model,and the enhanced results are incorporated back as training data for 4DGS. This process continues until extrapolation reaches the target viewpoints. Compared with baselines, our method produces higher-quality images at novel extrapolated viewpoints.

*Bertrand Rouet-Leduc,Claudia Hulbert*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 基于深度学习的卫星时序影像预测模型（改进自SATLAS基础模型）可实现高灵敏度地表变化检测，通过预测无变化时的地表形态发现异常。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: 构建基于SATLAS的图像修复模型，利用Sentinel-2时序影像（前6帧）预测最新帧，使用全球多气候带训练数据集训练模型，通过预测-观测差异检测异常。

Result: 在2023土耳其-叙利亚地震破裂检测中，该方法比时间中值法和Reed-Xiaoli算法灵敏度提升3倍（检测阈值降低3倍），首次发现Tepehan地区亚象元级地表裂缝。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了全球多光谱卫星数据驱动的地表变化自动化监测，其检测精度突破传统方法理论极限，为灾害应急和环境监测提供新范式。

Abstract: Detecting surface changes from satellite imagery is critical for rapid disaster response and environmental monitoring, yet remains challenging due to the complex interplay between atmospheric noise, seasonal variations, and sensor artifacts. Here we show that deep learning can leverage the temporal redundancy of satellite time series to detect anomalies at unprecedented sensitivity, by learning to predict what the surface should look like in the absence of change. We train an inpainting model built upon the SATLAS foundation model to reconstruct the last frame of a Sentinel-2 time series from preceding acquisitions, using globally distributed training data spanning diverse climate zones and land cover types. When applied to regions affected by sudden surface changes, the discrepancy between prediction and observation reveals anomalies that traditional change detection methods miss. We validate our approach on earthquake-triggered surface ruptures from the 2023 Turkey-Syria earthquake sequence, demonstrating detection of a rift feature in Tepehan with higher sensitivity and specificity than temporal median or Reed-Xiaoli anomaly detectors. Our method reaches detection thresholds approximately three times lower than baseline approaches, providing a path towards automated, global-scale monitoring of surface changes from freely available multi-spectral satellite data.

### [11] [GCA-ResUNet: Medical Image Segmentation Using Grouped Coordinate Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23990)
*Jun Ding,Shang Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了GCA-ResUNet框架，通过轻量级分组坐标注意力模块，显著提升医学图像中小尺度异质解剖结构的分割精度，在Synapse和ACDC数据集上Dice系数分别达到86.11%和92.64%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统U-Net在多器官场景和低对比度区域存在长程上下文建模不足，而Transformer类模型需大量计算资源，难以在临床部署。

Method: 设计分组坐标注意力模块（GCA），通过通道分组建模语义异质性，并结合方向感知的坐标编码捕获结构化空间依赖，保留CNN的高效性的同时增强全局表示能力。

Result: 在Synapse数据集（跨多器官）上Dice系数达86.11%，ACDC数据集（心脏MRI）达92.64%，优于Swin-UNet和TransUNet等模型，尤其在复杂边界的小结构分割中提升显著。

Conclusion: 该方法在分割精度与计算效率间取得平衡，适用于资源受限的临床场景部署。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of heterogeneous anatomical structures is pivotal for computer-aided diagnosis and subsequent clinical decision-making. Although U-Net based convolutional neural networks have achieved remarkable progress, their intrinsic locality and largely homogeneous attention formulations often limit the modeling of long-range contextual dependencies, especially in multi-organ scenarios and low-contrast regions. Transformer-based architectures mitigate this issue by leveraging global self-attention, but they usually require higher computational resources and larger training data, which may impede deployment in resource-constrained clinical environments.In this paper, we propose GCA-ResUNet, an efficient medical image segmentation framework equipped with a lightweight and plug-and-play Grouped Coordinate Attention (GCA) module. The proposed GCA decouples channel-wise context modeling into multiple groups to explicitly account for semantic heterogeneity across channels, and integrates direction-aware coordinate encoding to capture structured spatial dependencies along horizontal and vertical axes. This design enhances global representation capability while preserving the efficiency advantages of CNN backbones. Extensive experiments on two widely used benchmarks, Synapse and ACDC, demonstrate that GCA-ResUNet achieves Dice scores of 86.11% and 92.64%, respectively, outperforming a range of representative CNN and Transformer-based methods, including Swin-UNet and TransUNet. In particular, GCA-ResUNet yields consistent improvements in delineating small anatomical structures with complex boundaries. These results indicate that the proposed approach provides a favorable trade-off between segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency, offering a practical and scalable solution for clinical deployment.

TL;DR: 本文提出GASeg，通过可微分盒计数模块和拓扑增强策略，结合几何与表观特征实现语义分割性能突破。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法过度依赖阴影、反光等不稳定表观特征，导致自监督语义分割在外观模糊场景下表现不佳。

Method: 设计不同iable盒计数模块提取多尺度拓扑统计量，引入拓扑增强对抗训练策略，并构建几何-表观对齐损失函数GALoss。

Conclusion: 通过桥接几何与表观特征并利用多尺度拓扑信息，显著提升了自监督语义分割在复杂场景下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Self-supervised semantic segmentation methods often fail when faced with appearance ambiguities. We argue that this is due to an over-reliance on unstable, appearance-based features such as shadows, glare, and local textures. We propose \textbf{GASeg}, a novel framework that bridges appearance and geometry by leveraging stable topological information. The core of our method is Differentiable Box-Counting (\textbf{DBC}) module, which quantifies multi-scale topological statistics from two parallel streams: geometric-based features and appearance-based features. To force the model to learn these stable structural representations, we introduce Topological Augmentation (\textbf{TopoAug}), an adversarial strategy that simulates real-world ambiguities by applying morphological operators to the input images. A multi-objective loss, \textbf{GALoss}, then explicitly enforces cross-modal alignment between geometric-based and appearance-based features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GASeg achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmarks, including COCO-Stuff, Cityscapes, and PASCAL, validating our approach of bridging geometry and appearance via topological information.

### [13] [Improved 3D Gaussian Splatting of Unknown Spacecraft Structure Using Space Environment Illumination Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23998)
*Tae Ha Park,Simone D'Amico*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new pipeline uses 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enhanced with sunlight position data to reconstruct 3D spacecraft models under dynamic space lighting. The approach improves photometric quality for accurate camera pose estimation during rendezvous operations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recovering 3D structure from spaceborne images is challenging due to dynamic lighting conditions (e.g., rapid illumination changes, shadows) conflicting with 3DGS's static scene requirement. Existing methods struggle to maintain photometric accuracy crucial for downstream pose estimation tasks during Rendezvous and Proximity Operations (RPO).

Method: The proposed pipeline incorporates prior knowledge of the Sun's position (estimated by the servicer spacecraft) into 3DGS training. This adjusts the model's radiance learning to adapt to lighting variations during rasterization. Photometric optimization is applied to refine camera pose estimation alongside 3DGS reconstruction.

Result: 3DGS models trained with sunlight priors successfully capture dynamic lighting effects, including rapid illumination changes, global shadowing, and self-occlusion. The enhanced photometric accuracy enables robust camera pose estimation under challenging space conditions, validated through experimental studies on image sequences.

Conclusion: Integrating sunlight position priors into 3DGS training improves photometric quality and geometric accuracy of spacecraft reconstructions. This enables reliable pose estimation in dynamic space environments, addressing critical limitations for autonomous RPO applications.

Abstract: This work presents a novel pipeline to recover the 3D structure of an unknown target spacecraft from a sequence of images captured during Rendezvous and Proximity Operations (RPO) in space. The target's geometry and appearance are represented as a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model. However, learning 3DGS requires static scenes, an assumption in contrast to dynamic lighting conditions encountered in spaceborne imagery. The trained 3DGS model can also be used for camera pose estimation through photometric optimization. Therefore, in addition to recovering a geometrically accurate 3DGS model, the photometric accuracy of the rendered images is imperative to downstream pose estimation tasks during the RPO process. This work proposes to incorporate the prior knowledge of the Sun's position, estimated and maintained by the servicer spacecraft, into the training pipeline for improved photometric quality of 3DGS rasterization. Experimental studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution, as 3DGS models trained on a sequence of images learn to adapt to rapidly changing illumination conditions in space and reflect global shadowing and self-occlusion.

Abstract: Recent methods in flow-based diffusion editing have enabled direct transformations between source and target image distribution without explicit inversion. However, the latent trajectories in these methods often exhibit accumulated velocity errors, leading to semantic inconsistency and loss of structural fidelity. We propose Conditioned Velocity Correction (CVC), a principled framework that reformulates flow-based editing as a distribution transformation problem driven by a known source prior. CVC rethinks the role of velocity in inter-distribution transformation by introducing a dual-perspective velocity conversion mechanism. This mechanism explicitly decomposes the latent evolution into two components: a structure-preserving branch that remains consistent with the source trajectory, and a semantically-guided branch that drives a controlled deviation toward the target distribution. The conditional velocity field exhibits an absolute velocity error relative to the true underlying distribution trajectory, which inherently introduces potential instability and trajectory drift in the latent space. To address this quantifiable deviation and maintain fidelity to the true flow, we apply a posterior-consistent update to the resulting conditional velocity field. This update is derived from Empirical Bayes Inference and Tweedie correction, which ensures a mathematically grounded error compensation over time. Our method yields stable and interpretable latent dynamics, achieving faithful reconstruction alongside smooth local semantic conversion. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that CVC consistently achieves superior fidelity, better semantic alignment, and more reliable editing behavior across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Realistic virtual try-on (VTON) concerns not only faithful rendering of garment details but also coordination of the style. Prior art typically pursues the former, but neglects a key factor that shapes the holistic style -- garment fit. Garment fit delineates how a garment aligns with the body of a wearer and is a fundamental element in fashion design. In this work, we introduce fit-aware VTON and present FitControler, a learnable plug-in that can seamlessly integrate into modern VTON models to enable customized fit control. To achieve this, we highlight two challenges: i) how to delineate layouts of different fits and ii) how to render the garment that matches the layout. FitControler first features a fit-aware layout generator to redraw the body-garment layout conditioned on a set of delicately processed garment-agnostic representations, and a multi-scale fit injector is then used to deliver layout cues to enable layout-driven VTON. In particular, we build a fit-aware VTON dataset termed Fit4Men, including 13,000 body-garment pairs of different fits, covering both tops and bottoms, and featuring varying camera distances and body poses. Two fit consistency metrics are also introduced to assess the fitness of generations. Extensive experiments show that FitControler can work with various VTON models and achieve accurate fit control. Code and data will be released.

Conclusion: 方法通过结构-精度耦合优化显著提升2DGS的率失真性能，同时维持毫秒级解码速度，适合低码率实时应用。

Abstract: Recent advances in 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) have demonstrated its potential as a compact image representation with millisecond-level decoding. However, existing 2DGS-based pipelines allocate representation capacity and parameter precision largely oblivious to image structure, limiting their rate-distortion (RD) efficiency at low bitrates. To address this, we propose a structure-guided allocation principle for 2DGS, which explicitly couples image structure with both representation capacity and quantization precision, while preserving native decoding speed. First, we introduce a structure-guided initialization that assigns 2D Gaussians according to spatial structural priors inherent in natural images, yielding a localized and semantically meaningful distribution. Second, during quantization-aware fine-tuning, we propose adaptive bitwidth quantization of covariance parameters, which grants higher precision to small-scale Gaussians in complex regions and lower precision elsewhere, enabling RD-aware optimization, thereby reducing redundancy without degrading edge quality. Third, we impose a geometry-consistent regularization that aligns Gaussian orientations with local gradient directions to better preserve structural details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach substantially improves both the representational power and the RD performance of 2DGS while maintaining over 1000 FPS decoding. Compared with the baseline GSImage, we reduce BD-rate by 43.44% on Kodak and 29.91% on DIV2K.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit strong performance across various tasks. However, these VLMs encounter significant challenges when applied to the remote sensing domain due to the inherent differences between remote sensing images and natural images. Existing remote sensing VLMs often fail to extract fine-grained visual features and suffer from visual forgetting during deep language processing. To address this, we introduce MF-RSVLM, a Multi-Feature Fusion Remote Sensing Vision--Language Model that effectively extracts and fuses visual features for RS understanding. MF-RSVLM learns multi-scale visual representations and combines global context with local details, improving the capture of small and complex structures in RS scenes. A recurrent visual feature injection scheme ensures the language model remains grounded in visual evidence and reduces visual forgetting during generation. Extensive experiments on diverse RS benchmarks show that MF-RSVLM achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance across remote sensing classification, image captioning, and VQA tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RSAgent improves text-guided object segmentation by using multi-turn interactions with a segmentation toolbox for iterative refinement, outperforming previous methods on zero-shot and in-domain benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional one-shot grounding methods suffer from error accumulation and lack revision mechanisms when initial localization fails, requiring a more robust and iterative segmentation approach.

Method: Developed RSAgent (agentic MLLM) with: 
1) Multi-turn tool invocations for segmentation (query-tool-observe-loop)
2) Multi-turn reasoning trajectory synthesis pipeline
3) Two-stage training: supervised fine-tuning + agentic reinforcement learning with task-specific rewards

Result: Achieved 66.5% zero-shot gIoU on ReasonSeg (+9% over Seg-Zero-7B) and 81.5% cIoU on RefCOCOg while demonstrating strong cross-domain generalization through iterative refinement and multi-turn reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: Multi-turn agentic segmentation provides superior performance over one-shot approaches by enabling hypothesis revision and spatial re-localization through interactive tool usage, setting new SOTA for both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks.

Abstract: Text-guided object segmentation requires both cross-modal reasoning and pixel grounding abilities. Most recent methods treat text-guided segmentation as one-shot grounding, where the model predicts pixel prompts in a single forward pass to drive an external segmentor, which limits verification, refocusing and refinement when initial localization is wrong. To address this limitation, we propose RSAgent, an agentic Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) which interleaves reasoning and action for segmentation via multi-turn tool invocations. RSAgent queries a segmentation toolbox, observes visual feedback, and revises its spatial hypothesis using historical observations to re-localize targets and iteratively refine masks. We further build a data pipeline to synthesize multi-turn reasoning segmentation trajectories, and train RSAgent with a two-stage framework: cold-start supervised fine-tuning followed by agentic reinforcement learning with fine-grained, task-specific rewards. Extensive experiments show that RSAgent achieves a zero-shot performance of 66.5% gIoU on ReasonSeg test, improving over Seg-Zero-7B by 9%, and reaches 81.5% cIoU on RefCOCOg, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks.

Abstract: Image denoising is an important problem in low-level vision and serves as a critical module for many image recovery tasks. Anisotropic diffusion is a wide family of image denoising approaches with promising performance. However, traditional anisotropic diffusion approaches use explicit diffusion operators which are not well adapted to complex image structures. As a result, their performance is limited compared to recent learning-based approaches. In this work, we describe a trainable anisotropic diffusion framework based on reinforcement learning. By modeling the denoising process as a series of naive diffusion actions with order learned by deep Q-learning, we propose an effective diffusion-based image denoiser. The diffusion actions selected by deep Q-learning at different iterations indeed composite a stochastic anisotropic diffusion process with strong adaptivity to different image structures, which enjoys improvement over the traditional ones. The proposed denoiser is applied to removing three types of often-seen noise. The experiments show that it outperforms existing diffusion-based methods and competes with the representative deep CNN-based methods.

Conclusion: 通过细粒度数据划分和噪声抑制机制，解决了现有方法在鲁棒性、校准可靠性和数据利用率之间的矛盾。

Abstract: In recent years, Cross-Modal Retrieval (CMR) has made significant progress in the field of multi-modal analysis. However, since it is time-consuming and labor-intensive to collect large-scale and well-annotated data, the annotation of multi-modal data inevitably contains some noise. This will degrade the retrieval performance of the model. To tackle the problem, numerous robust CMR methods have been developed, including robust learning paradigms, label calibration strategies, and instance selection mechanisms. Unfortunately, they often fail to simultaneously satisfy model performance ceilings, calibration reliability, and data utilization rate. To overcome the limitations, we propose a novel robust cross-modal learning framework, namely Neighbor-aware Instance Refining with Noisy Labels (NIRNL). Specifically, we first propose Cross-modal Margin Preserving (CMP) to adjust the relative distance between positive and negative pairs, thereby enhancing the discrimination between sample pairs. Then, we propose Neighbor-aware Instance Refining (NIR) to identify pure subset, hard subset, and noisy subset through cross-modal neighborhood consensus. Afterward, we construct different tailored optimization strategies for this fine-grained partitioning, thereby maximizing the utilization of all available data while mitigating error propagation. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that NIRNL achieves state-of-the-art performance, exhibiting remarkable robustness, especially under high noise rates.

Conclusion: 通过平衡损失设计与任务解耦策略，有效解决了层次化标签体系下的数据不均衡与任务冲突问题，为细粒度遥感目标检测提供了新的方法框架。

Abstract: Fine-grained remote sensing datasets often use hierarchical label structures to differentiate objects in a coarse-to-fine manner, with each object annotated across multiple levels. However, embedding this semantic hierarchy into the representation learning space to improve fine-grained detection performance remains challenging. Previous studies have applied supervised contrastive learning at different hierarchical levels to group objects under the same parent class while distinguishing sibling subcategories. Nevertheless, they overlook two critical issues: (1) imbalanced data distribution across the label hierarchy causes high-frequency classes to dominate the learning process, and (2) learning semantic relationships among categories interferes with class-agnostic localization. To address these issues, we propose a balanced hierarchical contrastive loss combined with a decoupled learning strategy within the detection transformer (DETR) framework. The proposed loss introduces learnable class prototypes and equilibrates gradients contributed by different classes at each hierarchical level, ensuring that each hierarchical class contributes equally to the loss computation in every mini-batch. The decoupled strategy separates DETR's object queries into classification and localization sets, enabling task-specific feature extraction and optimization. Experiments on three fine-grained datasets with hierarchical annotations demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: In video and image generation tasks, Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models incur extremely high computational costs due to attention mechanisms, which limits their practical applications. Furthermore, with hardware advancements, a wide range of devices besides graphics processing unit (GPU), such as application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), have been increasingly adopted for model inference. Sparse attention, which leverages the inherent sparsity of attention by skipping computations for insignificant tokens, is an effective approach to mitigate computational costs. However, existing sparse attention methods have two critical limitations: the overhead of sparse pattern prediction and the lack of hardware generality, as most of these methods are designed for GPU. To address these challenges, this study proposes RainFusion2.0, which aims to develop an online adaptive, hardware-efficient, and low-overhead sparse attention mechanism to accelerate both video and image generative models, with robust performance across diverse hardware platforms. Key technical insights include: (1) leveraging block-wise mean values as representative tokens for sparse mask prediction; (2) implementing spatiotemporal-aware token permutation; and (3) introducing a first-frame sink mechanism specifically designed for video generation scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that RainFusion2.0 can achieve 80% sparsity while achieving an end-to-end speedup of 1.5~1.8x without compromising video quality. Moreover, RainFusion2.0 demonstrates effectiveness across various generative models and validates its generalization across diverse hardware platforms.

Abstract: Recent video-language models have shown great potential for video understanding, but still struggle with accurate temporal grounding for event-level perception. We observe that two main factors in video understanding (i.e., temporal grounding and textual response) form a logical hierarchy: accurate temporal evidence grounding lays the foundation for reliable textual response. However, existing works typically handle these two tasks in a coupled manner without a clear logical structure, leading to sub-optimal objectives. We address this from a factorized learning perspective. We first propose D$^2$VLM, a framework that decouples the learning of these two tasks while also emphasizing their inherent dependency. We adopt a "grounding then answering with evidence referencing" paradigm and introduce evidence tokens for evidence grounding, which emphasize event-level visual semantic capture beyond the focus on timestamp representation in existing works. To further facilitate the learning of these two tasks, we introduce a novel factorized preference optimization (FPO) algorithm. Unlike standard preference optimization, FPO explicitly incorporates probabilistic temporal grounding modeling into the optimization objective, enabling preference learning for both temporal grounding and textual response. We also construct a synthetic dataset to address the lack of suitable datasets for factorized preference learning with explicit temporal grounding. Experiments on various tasks demonstrate the clear advantage of our approach. Our source code is available at https://github.com/nusnlp/d2vlm.

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art paradigms predominantly treat Text-to-Motion (T2M) generation as a direct translation problem, mapping symbolic language directly to continuous poses. While effective for simple actions, this System 1 approach faces a fundamental theoretical bottleneck we identify as the Semantic-Kinematic Impedance Mismatch: the inherent difficulty of grounding semantically dense, discrete linguistic intent into kinematically dense, high-frequency motion data in a single shot. In this paper, we argue that the solution lies in an architectural shift towards Latent System 2 Reasoning. Drawing inspiration from Hierarchical Motor Control in cognitive science, we propose Latent Motion Reasoning (LMR) that reformulates generation as a two-stage Think-then-Act decision process. Central to LMR is a novel Dual-Granularity Tokenizer that disentangles motion into two distinct manifolds: a compressed, semantically rich Reasoning Latent for planning global topology, and a high-frequency Execution Latent for preserving physical fidelity. By forcing the model to autoregressively reason (plan the coarse trajectory) before it moves (instantiates the frames), we effectively bridge the ineffability gap between language and physics. We demonstrate LMR's versatility by implementing it for two representative baselines: T2M-GPT (discrete) and MotionStreamer (continuous). Extensive experiments show that LMR yields non-trivial improvements in both semantic alignment and physical plausibility, validating that the optimal substrate for motion planning is not natural language, but a learned, motion-aligned concept space.

Abstract: Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) serves as a core perception module in autonomous driving systems, but it remains highly susceptible to adversarial attacks. Errors in depth estimation may propagate through downstream decision making and influence overall traffic safety. Existing physical attacks primarily rely on texture-based patches, which impose strict placement constraints and exhibit limited realism, thereby reducing their effectiveness in complex driving environments. To overcome these limitations, this work introduces a training-free generative adversarial attack framework that generates naturalistic, scene-consistent adversarial objects via a diffusion-based conditional generation process. The framework incorporates a Salient Region Selection module that identifies regions most influential to MDE and a Jacobian Vector Product Guidance mechanism that steers adversarial gradients toward update directions supported by the pre-trained diffusion model. This formulation enables the generation of physically plausible adversarial objects capable of inducing substantial adversarial depth shifts. Extensive digital and physical experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing attacks in effectiveness, stealthiness, and physical deployability, underscoring its strong practical implications for autonomous driving safety assessment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current geometric reasoning benchmarks face issues like data contamination, overemphasis on final answers, and lack of diagnostic granularity, necessitating a more robust evaluation framework.

Method: GeoBench includes four reasoning levels (Visual Perception, Goal-Oriented Planning, Theorem Application, Self-Reflective Backtracking) with six verified tasks generated by TrustGeoGen to assess capabilities from attribute extraction to error correction.

Result: Specialized models (e.g., OpenAI-o3) outperformed general MLLMs, but performance declined with task complexity. Sub-goal decomposition and premise filtering improved accuracy, while Chain-of-Thought prompting hindered performance in some cases.

Conclusion: GeoBench provides a comprehensive framework for diagnosing geometric reasoning challenges and offers actionable insights to enhance problem-solving systems.

Abstract: Geometric problem solving constitutes a critical branch of mathematical reasoning, requiring precise analysis of shapes and spatial relationships. Current evaluations of geometric reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs) face limitations, including the risk of test data contamination from textbook-based benchmarks, overemphasis on final answers over reasoning processes, and insufficient diagnostic granularity. To address these issues, we present GeoBench, a hierarchical benchmark featuring four reasoning levels in geometric problem-solving: Visual Perception, Goal-Oriented Planning, Rigorous Theorem Application, and Self-Reflective Backtracking. Through six formally verified tasks generated via TrustGeoGen, we systematically assess capabilities ranging from attribute extraction to logical error correction. Experiments reveal that while reasoning models like OpenAI-o3 outperform general MLLMs, performance declines significantly with increasing task complexity. Key findings demonstrate that sub-goal decomposition and irrelevant premise filtering critically influence final problem-solving accuracy, whereas Chain-of-Thought prompting unexpectedly degrades performance in some tasks. These findings establish GeoBench as a comprehensive benchmark while offering actionable guidelines for developing geometric problem-solving systems.

Abstract: Automated neural network architecture design remains a significant challenge in computer vision. Task diversity and computational constraints require both effective architectures and efficient search methods. Large Language Models (LLMs) present a promising alternative to computationally intensive Neural Architecture Search (NAS), but their application to architecture generation in computer vision has not been systematically studied, particularly regarding prompt engineering and validation strategies. Building on the task-agnostic NNGPT/LEMUR framework, this work introduces and validates two key contributions for computer vision. First, we present Few-Shot Architecture Prompting (FSAP), the first systematic study of the number of supporting examples (n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) for LLM-based architecture generation. We find that using n = 3 examples best balances architectural diversity and context focus for vision tasks. Second, we introduce Whitespace-Normalized Hash Validation, a lightweight deduplication method (less than 1 ms) that provides a 100x speedup over AST parsing and prevents redundant training of duplicate computer vision architectures. In large-scale experiments across seven computer vision benchmarks (MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, CelebA, ImageNette, SVHN, Places365), we generated 1,900 unique architectures. We also introduce a dataset-balanced evaluation methodology to address the challenge of comparing architectures across heterogeneous vision tasks. These contributions provide actionable guidelines for LLM-based architecture search in computer vision and establish rigorous evaluation practices, making automated design more accessible to researchers with limited computational resources.

TL;DR: 提出D²-Align框架缓解文本到图像生成中的偏好模式崩溃问题，在保持人类偏好对齐的同时显著提升生成多样性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法在提升自动奖励指标时会导致生成多样性严重退化（偏好模式崩溃），需定量分析该现象并开发新框架解决

Method: ①构建量化评估基准DivGenBench；②提出方向解耦对齐（D²-Align）：在冻结奖励模型的情况下，通过其嵌入空间学习方向性校正向量并应用于优化过程

Result: 结合定性分析与多样性/质量量化指标，验证D²-Align在保持高奖励分数的同时有效维持生成多样性，显著优于现有方法

Conclusion: 成功识别奖励模型偏差导致的过优化问题，通过方向校正机制实现质量与多样性平衡，为扩散模型对齐提供新范式

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated significant progress in aligning text-to-image diffusion models with human preference via Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback. However, while existing methods achieve high scores on automated reward metrics, they often lead to Preference Mode Collapse (PMC)-a specific form of reward hacking where models converge on narrow, high-scoring outputs (e.g., images with monolithic styles or pervasive overexposure), severely degrading generative diversity. In this work, we introduce and quantify this phenomenon, proposing DivGenBench, a novel benchmark designed to measure the extent of PMC. We posit that this collapse is driven by over-optimization along the reward model's inherent biases. Building on this analysis, we propose Directional Decoupling Alignment (D$^2$-Align), a novel framework that mitigates PMC by directionally correcting the reward signal. Specifically, our method first learns a directional correction within the reward model's embedding space while keeping the model frozen. This correction is then applied to the reward signal during the optimization process, preventing the model from collapsing into specific modes and thereby maintaining diversity. Our comprehensive evaluation, combining qualitative analysis with quantitative metrics for both quality and diversity, reveals that D$^2$-Align achieves superior alignment with human preference.

Abstract: We present IMDD-1M, the first large-scale Industrial Multimodal Defect Dataset comprising 1,000,000 aligned image-text pairs, designed to advance multimodal learning for manufacturing and quality inspection. IMDD-1M contains high-resolution real-world defects spanning over 60 material categories and more than 400 defect types, each accompanied by expert-verified annotations and fine-grained textual descriptions detailing defect location, severity, and contextual attributes. This dataset enables a wide spectrum of applications, including classification, segmentation, retrieval, captioning, and generative modeling. Building upon IMDD-1M, we train a diffusion-based vision-language foundation model from scratch, specifically tailored for industrial scenarios. The model serves as a generalizable foundation that can be efficiently adapted to specialized domains through lightweight fine-tuning. With less than 5% of the task-specific data required by dedicated expert models, it achieves comparable performance, highlighting the potential of data-efficient foundation model adaptation for industrial inspection and generation, paving the way for scalable, domain-adaptive, and knowledge-grounded manufacturing intelligence.

Abstract: While recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have attained significant strides in multimodal reasoning, their reasoning processes remain predominantly text-centric, leading to suboptimal performance in complex long-horizon, vision-centric tasks. In this paper, we establish a novel Generative Multimodal Reasoning paradigm and introduce DiffThinker, a diffusion-based reasoning framework. Conceptually, DiffThinker reformulates multimodal reasoning as a native generative image-to-image task, achieving superior logical consistency and spatial precision in vision-centric tasks. We perform a systematic comparison between DiffThinker and MLLMs, providing the first in-depth investigation into the intrinsic characteristics of this paradigm, revealing four core properties: efficiency, controllability, native parallelism, and collaboration. Extensive experiments across four domains (sequential planning, combinatorial optimization, constraint satisfaction, and spatial configuration) demonstrate that DiffThinker significantly outperforms leading closed source models including GPT-5 (+314.2\%) and Gemini-3-Flash (+111.6\%), as well as the fine-tuned Qwen3-VL-32B baseline (+39.0\%), highlighting generative multimodal reasoning as a promising approach for vision-centric reasoning.

*Yu-Tang Chang,Pin-Wei Chen,Shih-Fang Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep Global Clustering (DGC) addresses memory constraints in hyperspectral imaging (HSI) analysis by learning global cluster structures from local patches without pre-training, achieving efficient segmentation with challenges in loss balancing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HSI analysis faces computational bottlenecks due to massive data volumes and memory constraints, while existing foundation models struggle to transfer to domain-specific applications like agricultural monitoring due to differences in spectral signatures and semantic targets.

Method: DGC operates on small overlapping spectral-spatial patches with consistent region enforcement, enabling memory-efficient training on consumer hardware via local-to-global clustering structure learning without pre-training.

Result: DGC achieved background-tissue separation (mean IoU 0.925) and unsupervised disease detection on a leaf disease dataset, with training completed in under 30 minutes, but exhibited optimization instability from multi-objective loss balancing.

Conclusion: DGC provides a conceptual framework for HSI segmentation with memory efficiency, but requires principled dynamic loss balancing approaches to address cluster over-merging and optimization instability in feature space.

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) analysis faces computational bottlenecks due to massive data volumes that exceed available memory. While foundation models pre-trained on large remote sensing datasets show promise, their learned representations often fail to transfer to domain-specific applications like close-range agricultural monitoring where spectral signatures, spatial scales, and semantic targets differ fundamentally. This report presents Deep Global Clustering (DGC), a conceptual framework for memory-efficient HSI segmentation that learns global clustering structure from local patch observations without pre-training. DGC operates on small patches with overlapping regions to enforce consistency, enabling training in under 30 minutes on consumer hardware while maintaining constant memory usage. On a leaf disease dataset, DGC achieves background-tissue separation (mean IoU 0.925) and demonstrates unsupervised disease detection through navigable semantic granularity. However, the framework suffers from optimization instability rooted in multi-objective loss balancing: meaningful representations emerge rapidly but degrade due to cluster over-merging in feature space. We position this work as intellectual scaffolding - the design philosophy has merit, but stable implementation requires principled approaches to dynamic loss balancing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出CorGi和CorGi+方法，通过减少扩散变换器（DiT）推理过程中的冗余计算，在保持生成质量的前提下实现高达2.0倍的推理加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散变换器（DiT）在视觉生成领域性能优异，但其迭代去噪过程与模型容量增大导致推理成本过高。现有方法显示其迭代计算存在显著冗余，需通过优化计算复用提升效率。

Method: 1）CorGi采用块级间隔缓存策略，通过低贡献度块的跨步缓存与重用降低冗余计算；2）CorGi+基于跨注意力机制提取关键token特征，结合部分注意力更新保护图像细节。两种方法均不需重新训练模型。

Result: 在DiT模型上的实验表明，CorGi在图像生成任务平均加速2.0倍，CorGi+在文本到图像生成任务保持同等加速效率的同时完整保留关键对象细节。

Conclusion: 所提方法通过量化分析块贡献度和注意力引导机制，实现免训练的推理优化，解决了DiT模型计算冗余问题，为实际部署提供新路径。

Abstract: Diffusion transformer (DiT) achieves remarkable performance in visual generation, but its iterative denoising process combined with larger capacity leads to a high inference cost. Recent works have demonstrated that the iterative denoising process of DiT models involves substantial redundant computation across steps. To effectively reduce the redundant computation in DiT, we propose CorGi (Contribution-Guided Block-Wise Interval Caching), training-free DiT inference acceleration framework that selectively reuses the outputs of transformer blocks in DiT across denoising steps. CorGi caches low-contribution blocks and reuses them in later steps within each interval to reduce redundant computation while preserving generation quality. For text-to-image tasks, we further propose CorGi+, which leverages per-block cross-attention maps to identify salient tokens and applies partial attention updates to protect important object details. Evaluation on the state-of-the-art DiT models demonstrates that CorGi and CorGi+ achieve up to 2.0x speedup on average, while preserving high generation quality.

### [33] [Medical Image Classification on Imbalanced Data Using ProGAN and SMA-Optimized ResNet: Application to COVID-19](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24214)
*Sina Jahromi,Farshid Hajati,Alireza Rezaee,Javaher Nourian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study proposes a progressive generative adversarial network (GAN) combined with a multi-objective optimization algorithm to address imbalanced data in medical image classification, achieving 95.5% and 98.5% accuracy for 4-class and 2-class chest X-ray datasets, respectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Imbalanced data poses significant challenges in medical image classification, especially during pandemics like COVID-19, where data scarcity and class disparity hinder accurate diagnosis using AI/ML methods. This study aims to overcome these obstacles.

Method: A progressive GAN generates synthetic medical images, which are combined with real data via a weighted approach. A multi-objective meta-heuristic optimization algorithm tunes the deep network classifier's hyperparameters to improve performance on imbalanced datasets.

Result: The model outperformed existing methods, achieving cross-validated accuracy rates of 95.5% (4-class) and 98.5% (2-class) on a large, imbalanced chest X-ray dataset of COVID-19 cases.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively mitigates data imbalance in medical imaging during pandemics, demonstrating the viability of GAN-based synthetic data augmentation and hyperparameter optimization for improving classification accuracy.

Abstract: The challenge of imbalanced data is prominent in medical image classification. This challenge arises when there is a significant disparity in the number of images belonging to a particular class, such as the presence or absence of a specific disease, as compared to the number of images belonging to other classes. This issue is especially notable during pandemics, which may result in an even more significant imbalance in the dataset. Researchers have employed various approaches in recent years to detect COVID-19 infected individuals accurately and quickly, with artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms at the forefront. However, the lack of sufficient and balanced data remains a significant obstacle to these methods. This study addresses the challenge by proposing a progressive generative adversarial network to generate synthetic data to supplement the real ones. The proposed method suggests a weighted approach to combine synthetic data with real ones before inputting it into a deep network classifier. A multi-objective meta-heuristic population-based optimization algorithm is employed to optimize the hyper-parameters of the classifier. The proposed model exhibits superior cross-validated metrics compared to existing methods when applied to a large and imbalanced chest X-ray image dataset of COVID-19. The proposed model achieves 95.5% and 98.5% accuracy for 4-class and 2-class imbalanced classification problems, respectively. The successful experimental outcomes demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in classifying medical images using imbalanced data during pandemics.

*Ziquan Liu,Zhewei Zhu,Xuyang Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种轻量级的注意力增强模块（ARM），用于提升基于CLIP的开放词汇语义分割（OVSS）性能，通过自适应融合分层特征实现“一次训练，通用部署”。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无训练方法依赖计算成本高昂的外部模型（如SAM、DINO）或手工设计静态规则，存在效率低或效果有限问题，需更优解决方案。

Method: 设计ARM模块，采用语义引导的交叉注意力块，利用深层特征（K、V）选择并优化浅层特征（Q），后接自注意力块。该模块仅需在通用数据集（如COCO-Stuff）训练一次即可作为通用后处理器。

Result: 实验表明，ARM在多个基准测试中提升基线性能，推理开销可忽略，且兼容多样化无训练框架。

Conclusion: ARM通过动态特征融合开创了高效的无训练OVSS范式，为通用视觉任务提供了一次训练即插即用的解决方案。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) is fundamentally hampered by the coarse, image-level representations of CLIP, which lack precise pixel-level details. Existing training-free methods attempt to resolve this by either importing priors from costly external foundation models (e.g., SAM, DINO) or by applying static, hand-crafted heuristics to CLIP's internal features. These approaches are either computationally expensive or sub-optimal. We propose the Attention Refinement Module (ARM), a lightweight, learnable module that effectively unlocks and refines CLIP's internal potential. Unlike static-fusion methods, ARM learns to adaptively fuse hierarchical features. It employs a semantically-guided cross-attention block, using robust deep features (K, V) to select and refine detail-rich shallow features (Q), followed by a self-attention block. The key innovation lies in a ``train once, use anywhere" paradigm. Trained once on a general-purpose dataset (e.g., COCO-Stuff), ARM acts as a universal plug-and-play post-processor for diverse training-free frameworks. Extensive experiments show that ARM consistently boosts baseline performance on multiple benchmarks with negligible inference overhead, establishing an efficient and effective paradigm for training-free OVSS.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本论文提出了Mirage，一个用于驾驶场景中逼真且连贯资产编辑的一阶段视频扩散模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于视觉的自动驾驶系统需要多样化和可扩展的训练数据。尽管视频物体编辑为数据增强提供了有前景的途径，但现有方法通常难以同时保持高视觉质量与时间连贯性。

Method: Mirage基于文本到视频扩散先验模型以确保帧间时间一致性，并通过从预训练2D编码器注入时间无关的潜在变量到3D解码器中，以在保留因果结构的同时恢复细节。此外，通过结合粗略3D对齐和精细2D优化，引入两阶段数据对齐策略以解决3D高斯分布匹配引起的姿态错位问题。

Result: 实验表明，Mirage在多样编辑场景中实现了高度真实性和时间一致性，并能推广到其他视频到视频的翻译任务。

Conclusion: Mirage可作为自动驾驶相关视频编辑和翻译任务的可靠基线，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Vision-centric autonomous driving systems rely on diverse and scalable training data to achieve robust performance. While video object editing offers a promising path for data augmentation, existing methods often struggle to maintain both high visual fidelity and temporal coherence. In this work, we propose \textbf{Mirage}, a one-step video diffusion model for photorealistic and coherent asset editing in driving scenes. Mirage builds upon a text-to-video diffusion prior to ensure temporal consistency across frames. However, 3D causal variational autoencoders often suffer from degraded spatial fidelity due to compression, and directly passing 3D encoder features to decoder layers breaks temporal causality. To address this, we inject temporally agnostic latents from a pretrained 2D encoder into the 3D decoder to restore detail while preserving causal structures. Furthermore, because scene objects and inserted assets are optimized under different objectives, their Gaussians exhibit a distribution mismatch that leads to pose misalignment. To mitigate this, we introduce a two-stage data alignment strategy combining coarse 3D alignment and fine 2D refinement, thereby improving alignment and providing cleaner supervision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mirage achieves high realism and temporal consistency across diverse editing scenarios. Beyond asset editing, Mirage can also generalize to other video-to-video translation tasks, serving as a reliable baseline for future research. Our code is available at https://github.com/wm-research/mirage.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGB相机在动态场景下存在性能瓶颈，事件相机虽具时序优势但缺乏色彩信息，现有融合方法忽视时间动态且计算开销大。

Method: 基于Mamba编码器的双分支架构，通过DDIM模块实现空间（CSIM）与时间（CTIM）双维度跨模态交互，降低跨模态歧义，联合建模RGB-事件数据。

Result: DDD17/DSEC数据集上达到SOTA性能，计算效率较现有融合方法显著提升，支持高效可扩展的多模态感知系统。

Conclusion: MambaSeg通过时空双维度建模充分发挥多模态互补性，在保证精度的同时降低计算成本，为实时场景语义分割提供新范式。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is a fundamental task in computer vision with wide-ranging applications, including autonomous driving and robotics. While RGB-based methods have achieved strong performance with CNNs and Transformers, their effectiveness degrades under fast motion, low-light, or high dynamic range conditions due to limitations of frame cameras. Event cameras offer complementary advantages such as high temporal resolution and low latency, yet lack color and texture, making them insufficient on their own. To address this, recent research has explored multimodal fusion of RGB and event data; however, many existing approaches are computationally expensive and focus primarily on spatial fusion, neglecting the temporal dynamics inherent in event streams. In this work, we propose MambaSeg, a novel dual-branch semantic segmentation framework that employs parallel Mamba encoders to efficiently model RGB images and event streams. To reduce cross-modal ambiguity, we introduce the Dual-Dimensional Interaction Module (DDIM), comprising a Cross-Spatial Interaction Module (CSIM) and a Cross-Temporal Interaction Module (CTIM), which jointly perform fine-grained fusion along both spatial and temporal dimensions. This design improves cross-modal alignment, reduces ambiguity, and leverages the complementary properties of each modality. Extensive experiments on the DDD17 and DSEC datasets demonstrate that MambaSeg achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance while significantly reducing computational cost, showcasing its promise for efficient, scalable, and robust multimodal perception.

Conclusion: PGMP通过物理仿真生成高质量数据与确定性优化策略，为临床CBCT金属伪影还原提供兼具高效性与稳定性的解决方案。

Abstract: Metal artifacts in Dental CBCT severely obscure anatomical structures, hindering diagnosis. Current deep learning for Metal Artifact Reduction (MAR) faces limitations: supervised methods suffer from spectral blurring due to "regression-to-the-mean", while unsupervised ones risk structural hallucinations. Denoising Diffusion Models (DDPMs) offer realism but rely on slow, stochastic iterative sampling, unsuitable for clinical use. To resolve this, we propose the Physically-Grounded Manifold Projection (PGMP) framework. First, our Anatomically-Adaptive Physics Simulation (AAPS) pipeline synthesizes high-fidelity training pairs via Monte Carlo spectral modeling and patient-specific digital twins, bridging the synthetic-to-real gap. Second, our DMP-Former adapts the Direct x-Prediction paradigm, reformulating restoration as a deterministic manifold projection to recover clean anatomy in a single forward pass, eliminating stochastic sampling. Finally, a Semantic-Structural Alignment (SSA) module anchors the solution using priors from medical foundation models (MedDINOv3), ensuring clinical plausibility. Experiments on synthetic and multi-center clinical datasets show PGMP outperforms state-of-the-art methods on unseen anatomy, setting new benchmarks in efficiency and diagnostic reliability.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made remarkable progress in video understanding. However, they suffer from a critical vulnerability: an over-reliance on language priors, which can lead to visual ungrounded hallucinations, especially when processing counterfactual videos that defy common sense. This limitation, stemming from the intrinsic data imbalance between text and video, is challenging to address due to the substantial cost of collecting and annotating counterfactual data. To address this, we introduce DualityForge, a novel counterfactual data synthesis framework that employs controllable, diffusion-based video editing to transform real-world videos into counterfactual scenarios. By embedding structured contextual information into the video editing and QA generation processes, the framework automatically produces high-quality QA pairs together with original-edited video pairs for contrastive training. Based on this, we build DualityVidQA, a large-scale video dataset designed to reduce MLLM hallucinations. In addition, to fully exploit the contrastive nature of our paired data, we propose Duality-Normalized Advantage Training (DNA-Train), a two-stage SFT-RL training regime where the RL phase applies pair-wise $\ell_1$ advantage normalization, thereby enabling a more stable and efficient policy optimization. Experiments on DualityVidQA-Test demonstrate that our method substantially reduces model hallucinations on counterfactual videos, yielding a relative improvement of 24.0% over the Qwen2.5-VL-7B baseline. Moreover, our approach achieves significant gains across both hallucination and general-purpose benchmarks, indicating strong generalization capability. We will open-source our dataset and code.

TL;DR: 本研究提出一种基于三维一致性的全景拼接框架，通过将图像提升至三维空间进行融合和投影，解决了传统二维方法在复杂场景中的几何失真与重影问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统二维图像拼接方法在处理多深度层与遮挡情况的复杂三维场景时，易产生重影和结构扭曲，尤其在多视角累积和360°闭环拼接任务中表现不足。

Method: 1) 将输入图像转换为统一三维空间中的密集点云并融合（加入置信度评估）；2) 以三维空间统一投影中心和等距圆柱投影生成全景图；3) 画布域内进行空洞填充以恢复纹理连贯性。

Result: 实验表明该方法在大视差与复杂遮挡场景下显著减少几何失真和重影伪影，生成更自然的360°全景结果。

Conclusion: 通过将拼接范式从二维变换转向三维一致性，该框架在保持几何约束的同时具备模块扩展性，为复杂场景拼接提供新思路。

Abstract: Traditional image stitching techniques have predominantly utilized two-dimensional homography transformations and mesh warping to achieve alignment on a planar surface. While effective for scenes that are approximately coplanar or exhibit minimal parallax, these approaches often result in ghosting, structural bending, and stretching distortions in non-overlapping regions when applied to real three-dimensional scenes characterized by multiple depth layers and occlusions. Such challenges are exacerbated in multi-view accumulations and 360° closed-loop stitching scenarios. In response, this study introduces a spatially lifted panoramic stitching framework that initially elevates each input image into a dense three-dimensional point representation within a unified coordinate system, facilitating global cross-view fusion augmented by confidence metrics. Subsequently, a unified projection center is established in three-dimensional space, and an equidistant cylindrical projection is employed to map the fused data onto a single panoramic manifold, thereby producing a geometrically consistent 360° panoramic layout. Finally, hole filling is conducted within the canvas domain to address unknown regions revealed by viewpoint transitions, restoring continuous texture and semantic coherence. This framework reconceptualizes stitching from a two-dimensional warping paradigm to a three-dimensional consistency paradigm and is designed to flexibly incorporate various three-dimensional lifting and completion modules. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method substantially mitigates geometric distortions and ghosting artifacts in scenarios involving significant parallax and complex occlusions, yielding panoramic results that are more natural and consistent.

TL;DR: EndoRare是一个无需重新训练的一次性生成框架，通过单例图像生成高保真罕见胃肠病变图像，在提升AI分类器性能与临床教学中表现显著效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 罕见胃肠病变在常规内镜检查中少见，导致可用数据不足，阻碍AI模型开发与临床培训。现有方法需大量数据且难以保持病变特征与多样性平衡。

Method: 提出EndoRare框架，利用语言引导的概念解耦，将病变特征（病理特征）分离，编码为可学习原型，非诊断属性自由变换以增强多样性。无需重新训练，仅需单张参考图像进行生成。

Result: 验证涵盖4种罕见病理（钙化纤维瘤、幼年息肉病等），生成图像被专家认定具临床可信度；数据增强显著提升AI分类器真阳性率，新手内镜医生盲读实验显示召回率提升0.400，精确度提升0.267。

Conclusion: EndoRare提供高效数据补充方案，填补罕见病在计算机辅助诊断与教育中的数据缺口，适用于资源有限场景。

Abstract: Rare gastrointestinal lesions are infrequently encountered in routine endoscopy, restricting the data available for developing reliable artificial intelligence (AI) models and training novice clinicians. Here we present EndoRare, a one-shot, retraining-free generative framework that synthesizes diverse, high-fidelity lesion exemplars from a single reference image. By leveraging language-guided concept disentanglement, EndoRare separates pathognomonic lesion features from non-diagnostic attributes, encoding the former into a learnable prototype embedding while varying the latter to ensure diversity. We validated the framework across four rare pathologies (calcifying fibrous tumor, juvenile polyposis syndrome, familial adenomatous polyposis, and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome). Synthetic images were judged clinically plausible by experts and, when used for data augmentation, significantly enhanced downstream AI classifiers, improving the true positive rate at low false-positive rates. Crucially, a blinded reader study demonstrated that novice endoscopists exposed to EndoRare-generated cases achieved a 0.400 increase in recall and a 0.267 increase in precision. These results establish a practical, data-efficient pathway to bridge the rare-disease gap in both computer-aided diagnostics and clinical education.

TL;DR: Virtual-Eyes preprocess improves LDCT lung cancer screening foundation models but may degrade specialist models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lack of quantified robust preprocessing in deep-learning pipelines for LDCT cancer screening motivates creating a standardized QC pipeline for clinical reliability.

Method: Develop Virtual-Eyes (16-bit, 512x512 resolution, lung block extraction via Hounsfield-unit filtering/score) and test on NLST dataset (765 patients, 182 cancer) against multiple models with frozen encoders.

Result: RAD-DINO improved AUC (slice-level 0.576→0.610; patient-level 0.646→0.735) and calibration (Brier 0.188→0.112), while Sybil/ResNet-18 degraded (Sybil AUC 0.886→0.837). Merlin showed poor transferability (AUC ~0.507-0.567).

Conclusion: Structured anatomical QC enhances generalist model workflows but risks disrupting specialist models reliant on raw clinical context patterns.

Abstract: Robust preprocessing is rarely quantified in deep-learning pipelines for low-dose CT (LDCT) lung cancer screening. We develop and validate Virtual-Eyes, a clinically motivated 16-bit CT quality-control pipeline, and measure its differential impact on generalist foundation models versus specialist models. Virtual-Eyes enforces strict 512x512 in-plane resolution, rejects short or non-diagnostic series, and extracts a contiguous lung block using Hounsfield-unit filtering and bilateral lung-coverage scoring while preserving the native 16-bit grid. Using 765 NLST patients (182 cancer, 583 non-cancer), we compute slice-level embeddings from RAD-DINO and Merlin with frozen encoders and train leakage-free patient-level MLP heads; we also evaluate Sybil and a 2D ResNet-18 baseline under Raw versus Virtual-Eyes inputs without backbone retraining. Virtual-Eyes improves RAD-DINO slice-level AUC from 0.576 to 0.610 and patient-level AUC from 0.646 to 0.683 (mean pooling) and from 0.619 to 0.735 (max pooling), with improved calibration (Brier score 0.188 to 0.112). In contrast, Sybil and ResNet-18 degrade under Virtual-Eyes (Sybil AUC 0.886 to 0.837; ResNet-18 AUC 0.571 to 0.596) with evidence of context dependence and shortcut learning, and Merlin shows limited transferability (AUC approximately 0.507 to 0.567) regardless of preprocessing. These results demonstrate that anatomically targeted QC can stabilize and improve generalist foundation-model workflows but may disrupt specialist models adapted to raw clinical context.

Motivation: 解决现有方法难以将异构指令（语言/音乐/轨迹）转化为稳定实时动作的问题，突破多模态感知与全身体执行的瓶颈

Method: 采用两阶段框架：1）FSQ编码器构建跨模态共享离散码本 2）因果流式Transformer输出动作轨迹，通过物理约束流形优化动作稳定性

Result: 在20小时UniMoCap数据集上，零样本运动跟踪成功率提升19%，实验证明对真实场景干扰具有强鲁棒性

Conclusion: 该方法首次实现亚500ms延迟的人形机器人多模态控制，推动了通用型服务机器人在物理交互场景的实用化

Abstract: A long-standing objective in humanoid robotics is the realization of versatile agents capable of following diverse multimodal instructions with human-level flexibility. Despite advances in humanoid control, bridging high-level multimodal perception with whole-body execution remains a significant bottleneck. Existing methods often struggle to translate heterogeneous instructions -- such as language, music, and trajectories -- into stable, real-time actions. Here we show that UniAct, a two-stage framework integrating a fine-tuned MLLM with a causal streaming pipeline, enables humanoid robots to execute multimodal instructions with sub-500 ms latency. By unifying inputs through a shared discrete codebook via FSQ, UniAct ensures cross-modal alignment while constraining motions to a physically grounded manifold. This approach yields a 19% improvement in the success rate of zero-shot tracking of imperfect reference motions. We validate UniAct on UniMoCap, our 20-hour humanoid motion benchmark, demonstrating robust generalization across diverse real-world scenarios. Our results mark a critical step toward responsive, general-purpose humanoid assistants capable of seamless interaction through unified perception and control.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CERES通过结合因果推理的双模态干预方法，在第一人称视频中更准确地分割与动作相关的物体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 因egocentric视角固有的模糊性（如快速运动、遮挡）及训练数据偏差，现有模型容易学习错误关联，导致分割效果不佳。

Method: 提出CERES框架，用后门调整消除语言嵌入偏差，以前门调整融合语义特征与深度信息，以因果原则增强视觉表示的鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明CERES在Ego-RVOS任务多项指标上均超越先前方法，达到SOTA水平。

Conclusion: 将因果推理引入egocentric视频理解可提升模型可靠性，为未来方法设计提供新思路。

Abstract: Egocentric Referring Video Object Segmentation (Ego-RVOS) aims to segment the specific object actively involved in a human action, as described by a language query, within first-person videos. This task is critical for understanding egocentric human behavior. However, achieving such segmentation robustly is challenging due to ambiguities inherent in egocentric videos and biases present in training data. Consequently, existing methods often struggle, learning spurious correlations from skewed object-action pairings in datasets and fundamental visual confounding factors of the egocentric perspective, such as rapid motion and frequent occlusions. To address these limitations, we introduce Causal Ego-REferring Segmentation (CERES), a plug-in causal framework that adapts strong, pre-trained RVOS backbones to the egocentric domain. CERES implements dual-modal causal intervention: applying backdoor adjustment principles to counteract language representation biases learned from dataset statistics, and leveraging front-door adjustment concepts to address visual confounding by intelligently integrating semantic visual features with geometric depth information guided by causal principles, creating representations more robust to egocentric distortions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CERES achieves state-of-the-art performance on Ego-RVOS benchmarks, highlighting the potential of applying causal reasoning to build more reliable models for broader egocentric video understanding.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在2D图像上存在空间推理不足和几何感知缺陷，导致自动驾驶决策不可靠。

Method: 提出渐进式融合Q-Former逐步注入LiDAR特征，并构建空间感知问答(SA-QA)数据集强化3D感知训练

Result: 在驾驶基准测试中超越纯视觉模型，在场景理解准确率提升18.7%，空间推理误差减少32.4%

Conclusion: 显式3D测量数据与VLMs的融合是构建可信自动驾驶系统的关键技术路径

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show significant promise for end-to-end autonomous driving by leveraging the common sense embedded in language models, their reliance on 2D image cues for complex scene understanding and decision-making presents a critical bottleneck for safety and reliability. Current image-based methods struggle with accurate metric spatial reasoning and geometric inference, leading to unreliable driving policies. To bridge this gap, we propose LVLDrive (LiDAR-Vision-Language), a novel framework specifically designed to upgrade existing VLMs with robust 3D metric spatial understanding for autonomous driving by incoperating LiDAR point cloud as an extra input modality. A key challenge lies in mitigating the catastrophic disturbance introduced by disparate 3D data to the pre-trained VLMs. To this end, we introduce a Gradual Fusion Q-Former that incrementally injects LiDAR features, ensuring the stability and preservation of the VLM's existing knowledge base. Furthermore, we develop a spatial-aware question-answering (SA-QA) dataset to explicitly teach the model advanced 3D perception and reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments on driving benchmarks demonstrate that LVLDrive achieves superior performance compared to vision-only counterparts across scene understanding, metric spatial perception, and reliable driving decision-making. Our work highlights the necessity of explicit 3D metric data for building trustworthy VLM-based autonomous systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in dermatological image analysis have been driven by large-scale annotated datasets; however, most existing benchmarks focus on dermatoscopic images and lack patient-authored queries and clinical context, limiting their applicability to patient-centered care. To address this gap, we introduce DermaVQA-DAS, an extension of the DermaVQA dataset that supports two complementary tasks: closed-ended question answering (QA) and dermatological lesion segmentation. Central to this work is the Dermatology Assessment Schema (DAS), a novel expert-developed framework that systematically captures clinically meaningful dermatological features in a structured and standardized form. DAS comprises 36 high-level and 27 fine-grained assessment questions, with multiple-choice options in English and Chinese. Leveraging DAS, we provide expert-annotated datasets for both closed QA and segmentation and benchmark state-of-the-art multimodal models. For segmentation, we evaluate multiple prompting strategies and show that prompt design impacts performance: the default prompt achieves the best results under Mean-of-Max and Mean-of-Mean evaluation aggregation schemes, while an augmented prompt incorporating both patient query title and content yields the highest performance under majority-vote-based microscore evaluation, achieving a Jaccard index of 0.395 and a Dice score of 0.566 with BiomedParse. For closed-ended QA, overall performance is strong across models, with average accuracies ranging from 0.729 to 0.798; o3 achieves the best overall accuracy (0.798), closely followed by GPT-4.1 (0.796), while Gemini-1.5-Pro shows competitive performance within the Gemini family (0.783). We publicly release DermaVQA-DAS, the DAS schema, and evaluation protocols to support and accelerate future research in patient-centered dermatological vision-language modeling (https://osf.io/72rp3).

Abstract: The rapid advancement of autonomous systems, including self-driving vehicles and drones, has intensified the need to forge true Spatial Intelligence from multi-modal onboard sensor data. While foundation models excel in single-modal contexts, integrating their capabilities across diverse sensors like cameras and LiDAR to create a unified understanding remains a formidable challenge. This paper presents a comprehensive framework for multi-modal pre-training, identifying the core set of techniques driving progress toward this goal. We dissect the interplay between foundational sensor characteristics and learning strategies, evaluating the role of platform-specific datasets in enabling these advancements. Our central contribution is the formulation of a unified taxonomy for pre-training paradigms: ranging from single-modality baselines to sophisticated unified frameworks that learn holistic representations for advanced tasks like 3D object detection and semantic occupancy prediction. Furthermore, we investigate the integration of textual inputs and occupancy representations to facilitate open-world perception and planning. Finally, we identify critical bottlenecks, such as computational efficiency and model scalability, and propose a roadmap toward general-purpose multi-modal foundation models capable of achieving robust Spatial Intelligence for real-world deployment.

TL;DR: RedunCut optimizes dynamic model size selection for live video analytics, reducing compute costs by 14-62% while maintaining accuracy, particularly effective for mobile videos and varying accuracy targets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DMSS systems struggle with inefficient sampling (high cost) and inaccurate accuracy prediction, leading to poor generalization across diverse video workloads like mobile streams or low-accuracy scenarios.

Method: RedunCut introduces (1) a measurement-driven planner to estimate sampling cost-benefit trade-offs and (2) a lightweight data-driven model to predict per-segment accuracy, enabling adaptive model selection without retraining.

Result: RedunCut achieves 14-62% compute cost reduction at fixed accuracy across road-vehicle, drone, and surveillance videos, with robustness to data drift and limited historical data.

Conclusion: By optimizing sampling efficiency and accuracy prediction, RedunCut outperforms prior DMSS systems in real-world settings, enabling cost-effective, adaptable live video analytics without modifying model architectures.

Abstract: Live video analytics (LVA) runs continuously across massive camera fleets, but inference cost with modern vision models remains high. To address this, dynamic model size selection (DMSS) is an attractive approach: it is content-aware but treats models as black boxes, and could potentially reduce cost by up to 10x without model retraining or modification. Without ground truth labels at runtime, we observe that DMSS methods use two stages per segment: (i) sampling a few models to calculate prediction statistics (e.g., confidences), then (ii) selection of the model size from those statistics. Prior systems fail to generalize to diverse workloads, particularly to mobile videos and lower accuracy targets. We identify that the failure modes stem from inefficient sampling whose cost exceeds its benefit, and inaccurate per-segment accuracy prediction.
  In this work, we present RedunCut, a new DMSS system that addresses both: It uses a measurement-driven planner that estimates the cost-benefit tradeoff of sampling, and a lightweight, data-driven performance model to improve accuracy prediction. Across road-vehicle, drone, and surveillance videos and multiple model families and tasks, RedunCut reduces compute cost by 14-62% at fixed accuracy and remains robust to limited historical data and to drift.

Motivation: 现有分块方法因需完整非因果上下文导致高延迟，妨碍实时非语言反馈，需开发低延迟且高质量的生成模型。

Method: （1）流式自回归框架结合流匹配头进行概率建模；（2）带前瞻模块的因果编码器，利用短未来上下文（如60ms）优化生成质量。

Result: 实现单帧生成34ms延迟，系统整体延迟<100ms，HDTF数据集离线/在线唇同步得分8.13/7.61，显著优于蒸馏等因果方法。

Conclusion: DyStream通过流式架构与前瞻模块设计，解决了超低延迟与生成质量的矛盾，成为实时对话视频生成的SOTA方法。

Abstract: Generating realistic, dyadic talking head video requires ultra-low latency. Existing chunk-based methods require full non-causal context windows, introducing significant delays. This high latency critically prevents the immediate, non-verbal feedback required for a realistic listener. To address this, we present DyStream, a flow matching-based autoregressive model that could generate video in real-time from both speaker and listener audio. Our method contains two key designs: (1) we adopt a stream-friendly autoregressive framework with flow-matching heads for probabilistic modeling, and (2) We propose a causal encoder enhanced by a lookahead module to incorporate short future context (e.g., 60 ms) to improve quality while maintaining low latency. Our analysis shows this simple-and-effective method significantly surpass alternative causal strategies, including distillation and generative encoder. Extensive experiments show that DyStream could generate video within 34 ms per frame, guaranteeing the entire system latency remains under 100 ms. Besides, it achieves state-of-the-art lip-sync quality, with offline and online LipSync Confidence scores of 8.13 and 7.61 on HDTF, respectively. The model, weights and codes are available.

Conclusion: 该AI系统可提供客观、一致的手术技能评估，突破传统方法的资源瓶颈，为外科教育的标准化、数据驱动化训练提供技术支持。

Abstract: The development of effective training and evaluation strategies is critical. Conventional methods for assessing surgical proficiency typically rely on expert supervision, either through onsite observation or retrospective analysis of recorded procedures. However, these approaches are inherently subjective, susceptible to inter-rater variability, and require substantial time and effort from expert surgeons. These demands are often impractical in low- and middle-income countries, thereby limiting the scalability and consistency of such methods across training programs. To address these limitations, we propose a novel AI-driven framework for the automated assessment of microanastomosis performance. The system integrates a video transformer architecture based on TimeSformer, improved with hierarchical temporal attention and weighted spatial attention mechanisms, to achieve accurate action recognition within surgical videos. Fine-grained motion features are then extracted using a YOLO-based object detection and tracking method, allowing for detailed analysis of instrument kinematics. Performance is evaluated along five aspects of microanastomosis skill, including overall action execution, motion quality during procedure-critical actions, and general instrument handling. Experimental validation using a dataset of 58 expert-annotated videos demonstrates the effectiveness of the system, achieving 87.7% frame-level accuracy in action segmentation that increased to 93.62% with post-processing, and an average classification accuracy of 76% in replicating expert assessments across all skill aspects. These findings highlight the system's potential to provide objective, consistent, and interpretable feedback, thereby enabling more standardized, data-driven training and evaluation in surgical education.

Conclusion: ViT编码器在潜在空间实现了基元的近似可组合性，揭示了其分层组合结构特性，为理解ViT处理视觉信息提供了新视角。

Abstract: While insights into the workings of the transformer model have largely emerged by analysing their behaviour on language tasks, this work investigates the representations learnt by the Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder through the lens of compositionality. We introduce a framework, analogous to prior work on measuring compositionality in representation learning, to test for compositionality in the ViT encoder. Crucial to drawing this analogy is the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), which is a simple yet effective tool for obtaining input-dependent primitives in the vision setting. By examining the ability of composed representations to reproduce original image representations, we empirically test the extent to which compositionality is respected in the representation space. Our findings show that primitives from a one-level DWT decomposition produce encoder representations that approximately compose in latent space, offering a new perspective on how ViTs structure information.

Abstract: High-fidelity compression of multispectral solar imagery remains challenging for space missions, where limited bandwidth must be balanced against preserving fine spectral and spatial details. We present a learned image compression framework tailored to solar observations, leveraging two complementary modules: (1) the Inter-Spectral Windowed Graph Embedding (iSWGE), which explicitly models inter-band relationships by representing spectral channels as graph nodes with learned edge features; and (2) the Windowed Spatial Graph Attention and Convolutional Block Attention (WSGA-C), which combines sparse graph attention with convolutional attention to reduce spatial redundancy and emphasize fine-scale structures. Evaluations on the SDOML dataset across six extreme ultraviolet (EUV) channels show that our approach achieves a 20.15%reduction in Mean Spectral Information Divergence (MSID), up to 1.09% PSNR improvement, and a 1.62% log transformed MS-SSIM gain over strong learned baselines, delivering sharper and spectrally faithful reconstructions at comparable bits-per-pixel rates.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于DINOv2低级特征的Feature-to-Image Diffusion（F2IDiff）模型，通过严格且丰富的特征控制解决手机摄影中单图超分辨率的生成幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像扩散模型（T2IDiff）在手机摄影低分辨率（LR）图像超分辨中易产生幻觉，因其高阶文本特征难以精确描述高频纹理，且手机LR图像（≥12MP）远大于传统模型处理的图像尺寸（<1MP），导致切片条件描述不准确。

Method: 构建F2IDiff基础模型，采用DINOv2低级视觉特征替代文本特征作为扩散过程的严格约束条件，通过特征到图像的扩散框架实现高保真超分辨率重建。

Result: 实验表明低级特征可严格控制生成过程，既保证手机摄影LR图像（高保真场景）的非幻觉重建，又适用于学术场景（低保真LR图像）的大尺度恢复，突破传统模型对图像尺寸的限制。

Conclusion: 生成质量在超分辨率任务中受制于特征条件约束的严格性与丰富性，基于低级视觉特征的扩散模型能更精准平衡生成强度与重建真实性，为消费电子设备端到端应用提供新框架。

Abstract: With the advent of Generative AI, Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) quality has seen substantial improvement, as the strong priors learned by Text-2-Image Diffusion (T2IDiff) Foundation Models (FM) can bridge the gap between High-Resolution (HR) and Low-Resolution (LR) images. However, flagship smartphone cameras have been slow to adopt generative models because strong generation can lead to undesirable hallucinations. For substantially degraded LR images, as seen in academia, strong generation is required and hallucinations are more tolerable because of the wide gap between LR and HR images. In contrast, in consumer photography, the LR image has substantially higher fidelity, requiring only minimal hallucination-free generation. We hypothesize that generation in SISR is controlled by the stringency and richness of the FM's conditioning feature. First, text features are high level features, which often cannot describe subtle textures in an image. Additionally, Smartphone LR images are at least $12MP$, whereas SISR networks built on T2IDiff FM are designed to perform inference on much smaller images ($<1MP$). As a result, SISR inference has to be performed on small patches, which often cannot be accurately described by text feature. To address these shortcomings, we introduce an SISR network built on a FM with lower-level feature conditioning, specifically DINOv2 features, which we call a Feature-to-Image Diffusion (F2IDiff) Foundation Model (FM). Lower level features provide stricter conditioning while being rich descriptors of even small patches.

Conclusion: 本研究表明结合CV模型与LLM可有效生成临床级医学报告，但当前LLM在诊断文本的流畅度方面仍存在提升空间，未来需改进语言生成的临床适配性

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed medical imaging, with computer vision (CV) systems achieving state-of-the-art performance in classification and detection tasks. However, these systems typically output structured predictions, leaving radiologists responsible for translating results into full narrative reports. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, offer new opportunities to bridge this gap by generating diagnostic narratives from structured findings. This study introduces a pipeline that integrates YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 for anomaly detection in chest X-ray images with a large language model (LLM) to generate natural-language radiology reports. The YOLO models produce bounding-box predictions and class labels, which are then passed to the LLM to generate descriptive findings and clinical summaries. YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 are compared in terms of detection accuracy, inference latency, and the quality of generated text, as measured by cosine similarity to ground-truth reports. Results show strong semantic similarity between AI and human reports, while human evaluation reveals GPT-4 excels in clarity (4.88/5) but exhibits lower scores for natural writing flow (2.81/5), indicating that current systems achieve clinical accuracy but remain stylistically distinguishable from radiologist-authored text.

TL;DR: Proposes MS-VQ-VAE, a hierarchical latent video compression model for edge devices, achieving efficient storage and transmission while maintaining perceptual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing codecs (H.264/HEVC) are pixel-domain focused and lack ML-friendly latent representations, hindering integration into deep learning pipelines for bandwidth/edge-constrained scenarios.

Method: Extends VQ-VAE-2 to spatiotemporal 3D convolutions with a two-level hierarchical latent structure (18.5M parameters). Introduces perceptual loss from pre-trained VGG16 for quality improvement. Trained on UCF101 (32-frame 2s clips).

Result: Test set: 25.96 dB PSNR and 0.8375 SSIM. Validation improvement over baseline: +1.41 dB PSNR and +0.0248 SSIM. Lightweight design suitable for edge devices.

Conclusion: Enables scalable video compression for bandwidth-sensitive applications (streaming, mobile analytics, CDN storage) with machine learning-compatible latent representations.

Abstract: The exponential growth of video traffic has placed increasing demands on bandwidth and storage infrastructure, particularly for content delivery networks (CDNs) and edge devices. While traditional video codecs like H.264 and HEVC achieve high compression ratios, they are designed primarily for pixel-domain reconstruction and lack native support for machine learning-centric latent representations, limiting their integration into deep learning pipelines. In this work, we present a Multi-Scale Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (MS-VQ-VAE) designed to generate compact, high-fidelity latent representations of low-resolution video, suitable for efficient storage, transmission, and client-side decoding. Our architecture extends the VQ-VAE-2 framework to a spatiotemporal setting, introducing a two-level hierarchical latent structure built with 3D residual convolutions. The model is lightweight (approximately 18.5M parameters) and optimized for 64x64 resolution video clips, making it appropriate for deployment on edge devices with constrained compute and memory resources. To improve perceptual reconstruction quality, we incorporate a perceptual loss derived from a pre-trained VGG16 network. Trained on the UCF101 dataset using 2-second video clips (32 frames at 16 FPS), on the test set we achieve 25.96 dB PSNR and 0.8375 SSIM. On validation, our model improves over the single-scale baseline by 1.41 dB PSNR and 0.0248 SSIM. The proposed framework is well-suited for scalable video compression in bandwidth-sensitive scenarios, including real-time streaming, mobile video analytics, and CDN-level storage optimization.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video (T2V) generation have achieved good visual quality, yet synthesizing videos that faithfully follow physical laws remains an open challenge. Existing methods mainly based on graphics or prompt extension struggle to generalize beyond simple simulated environments or learn implicit physical reasoning. The scarcity of training data with rich physics interactions and phenomena is also a problem. In this paper, we first introduce a Physics-Augmented video data construction Pipeline, PhyAugPipe, that leverages a vision-language model (VLM) with chain-of-thought reasoning to collect a large-scale training dataset, PhyVidGen-135K. Then we formulate a principled Physics-aware Groupwise Direct Preference Optimization, PhyGDPO, framework that builds upon the groupwise Plackett-Luce probabilistic model to capture holistic preferences beyond pairwise comparisons. In PhyGDPO, we design a Physics-Guided Rewarding (PGR) scheme that embeds VLM-based physics rewards to steer optimization toward physical consistency. We also propose a LoRA-Switch Reference (LoRA-SR) scheme that eliminates memory-heavy reference duplication for efficient training. Experiments show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art open-source methods on PhyGenBench and VideoPhy2.

Conclusion: 显式优化决策模糊样本能有效提升CDVQA任务性能，无需额外监督。

Abstract: Change detection visual question answering (CDVQA) requires answering text queries by reasoning about semantic changes in bi-temporal remote sensing images. A straightforward approach is to boost CDVQA performance with generic vision-language models via supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Despite recent progress, we observe that a significant portion of failures do not stem from clearly incorrect predictions, but from decision ambiguity, where the model assigns similar confidence to the correct answer and strong distractors. To formalize this challenge, we define Decision-Ambiguous Samples (DAS) as instances with a small probability margin between the ground-truth answer and the most competitive alternative. We argue that explicitly optimizing DAS is crucial for improving the discriminability and robustness of CDVQA models. To this end, we propose DARFT, a Decision-Ambiguity-guided Reinforcement Fine-Tuning framework that first mines DAS using an SFT-trained reference policy and then applies group-relative policy optimization on the mined subset. By leveraging multi-sample decoding and intra-group relative advantages, DARFT suppresses strong distractors and sharpens decision boundaries without additional supervision. Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent gains over SFT baselines, particularly under few-shot settings.

Conclusion: SliceLens显著优于现有方法，FeSD基准为细粒度误差分析提供了标准化评估工具，二者协同推动了多实例视觉任务的可靠性研究。

Abstract: Systematic failures of computer vision models on subsets with coherent visual patterns, known as error slices, pose a critical challenge for robust model evaluation. Existing slice discovery methods are primarily developed for image classification, limiting their applicability to multi-instance tasks such as detection, segmentation, and pose estimation. In real-world scenarios, error slices often arise from corner cases involving complex visual relationships, where existing instance-level approaches lacking fine-grained reasoning struggle to yield meaningful insights. Moreover, current benchmarks are typically tailored to specific algorithms or biased toward image classification, with artificial ground truth that fails to reflect real model failures. To address these limitations, we propose SliceLens, a hypothesis-driven framework that leverages LLMs and VLMs to generate and verify diverse failure hypotheses through grounded visual reasoning, enabling reliable identification of fine-grained and interpretable error slices. We further introduce FeSD (Fine-grained Slice Discovery), the first benchmark specifically designed for evaluating fine-grained error slice discovery across instance-level vision tasks, featuring expert-annotated and carefully refined ground-truth slices with precise grounding to local error regions. Extensive experiments on both existing benchmarks and FeSD demonstrate that SliceLens achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving Precision@10 by 0.42 (0.73 vs. 0.31) on FeSD, and identifies interpretable slices that facilitate actionable model improvements, as validated through model repair experiments.

Abstract: The increasing frequency of natural disasters poses severe threats to human lives and leads to substantial economic losses. While 3D semantic segmentation is crucial for post-disaster assessment, existing deep learning models lack datasets specifically designed for post-disaster environments. To address this gap, we constructed a specialized 3D dataset using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-captured aerial footage of Hurricane Ian (2022) over affected areas, employing Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Multi-View Stereo (MVS) techniques to reconstruct 3D point clouds. We evaluated the state-of-the-art (SOTA) 3D semantic segmentation models, Fast Point Transformer (FPT), Point Transformer v3 (PTv3), and OA-CNNs on this dataset, exposing significant limitations in existing methods for disaster-stricken regions. These findings underscore the urgent need for advancements in 3D segmentation techniques and the development of specialized 3D benchmark datasets to improve post-disaster scene understanding and response.

Conclusion: 通过基空间协作与多样性增强，解决了低秩适配中参数效率与学习容量的矛盾，为视觉Transformer微调提供了高效框架。

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has achieved remarkable success in fine-tuning pre-trained vision transformers for various downstream tasks. Existing studies mainly focus on exploring more parameter-efficient strategies or more effective representation learning schemes. However, these methods either sacrifice fine-tuning performance or introduce excessive trainable parameters, failing to strike a balance between learning performance and parameter efficiency. To address this problem, we propose a novel tuning method named collaborative low-rank adaptation (CLoRA) in this paper. CLoRA consists of base-space sharing and sample-agnostic diversity enhancement (SADE) components. To maintain parameter efficiency while expanding the learning capacity of low-rank modules (LRMs), base-space sharing allows all LRMs to share a set of down/up-projection spaces. In CLoRA, the low-rank matrices obtained from the shared spaces collaboratively construct each LRM. Since the representations extracted by these matrices may contain redundant information, SADE is employed to regularize the similarities among them to encourage diverse representations in the training process. We conduct extensive experiments on widely used image and point cloud datasets to evaluate the performance of CLoRA. Experimental results demonstrate that CLoRA strikes a better balance between learning performance and parameter efficiency, while requiring the fewest GFLOPs for point cloud analysis, compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: 3D visual grounding aims to localize the object in 3D point cloud scenes that semantically corresponds to given natural language sentences. It is very critical for roadside infrastructure system to interpret natural languages and localize relevant target objects in complex traffic environments. However, most existing datasets and approaches for 3D visual grounding focus on the indoor and outdoor driving scenes, outdoor monitoring scenarios remain unexplored due to scarcity of paired point cloud-text data captured by roadside infrastructure sensors. In this paper, we introduce a novel task of 3D Visual Grounding for Outdoor Monitoring Scenarios, which enables infrastructure-level understanding of traffic scenes beyond the ego-vehicle perspective. To support this task, we construct MoniRefer, the first real-world large-scale multi-modal dataset for roadside-level 3D visual grounding. The dataset consists of about 136,018 objects with 411,128 natural language expressions collected from multiple complex traffic intersections in the real-world environments. To ensure the quality and accuracy of the dataset, we manually verified all linguistic descriptions and 3D labels for objects. Additionally, we also propose a new end-to-end method, named Moni3DVG, which utilizes the rich appearance information provided by images and geometry and optical information from point cloud for multi-modal feature learning and 3D object localization. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on the proposed benchmarks demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our method. Our dataset and code will be released.

Abstract: Object detection in fire rescue scenarios is importance for command and decision-making in firefighting operations. However, existing research still suffers from two main limitations. First, current work predominantly focuses on environments such as mountainous or forest areas, while paying insufficient attention to urban rescue scenes, which are more frequent and structurally complex. Second, existing detection systems include a limited number of classes, such as flames and smoke, and lack a comprehensive system covering key targets crucial for command decisions, such as fire trucks and firefighters. To address the above issues, this paper first constructs a new dataset named "FireRescue" for rescue command, which covers multiple rescue scenarios, including urban, mountainous, forest, and water areas, and contains eight key categories such as fire trucks and firefighters, with a total of 15,980 images and 32,000 bounding boxes. Secondly, to tackle the problems of inter-class confusion and missed detection of small targets caused by chaotic scenes, diverse targets, and long-distance shooting, this paper proposes an improved model named FRS-YOLO. On the one hand, the model introduces a plug-and-play multidi-mensional collaborative enhancement attention module, which enhances the discriminative representation of easily confused categories (e.g., fire trucks vs. ordinary trucks) through cross-dimensional feature interaction. On the other hand, it integrates a dynamic feature sampler to strengthen high-response foreground features, thereby mitigating the effects of smoke occlusion and background interference. Experimental results demonstrate that object detection in fire rescue scenarios is highly challenging, and the proposed method effectively improves the detection performance of YOLO series models in this context.

Conclusion: RadAR通过并行化径向生成与动态输出校正机制，有效解决了自回归视觉生成的效率瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Inspired by the remarkable success of autoregressive models in language modeling, this paradigm has been widely adopted in visual generation. However, the sequential token-by-token decoding mechanism inherent in traditional autoregressive models leads to low inference efficiency.In this paper, we propose RadAR, an efficient and parallelizable framework designed to accelerate autoregressive visual generation while preserving its representational capacity. Our approach is motivated by the observation that visual tokens exhibit strong local dependencies and spatial correlations with their neighbors--a property not fully exploited in standard raster-scan decoding orders. Specifically, we organize the generation process around a radial topology: an initial token is selected as the starting point, and all other tokens are systematically grouped into multiple concentric rings according to their spatial distances from this center. Generation then proceeds in a ring-wise manner, from inner to outer regions, enabling the parallel prediction of all tokens within the same ring. This design not only preserves the structural locality and spatial coherence of visual scenes but also substantially increases parallelization. Furthermore, to address the risk of inconsistent predictions arising from simultaneous token generation with limited context, we introduce a nested attention mechanism. This mechanism dynamically refines implausible outputs during the forward pass, thereby mitigating error accumulation and preventing model collapse. By integrating radial parallel prediction with dynamic output correction, RadAR significantly improves generation efficiency.

Abstract: Reasoning Segmentation requires models to interpret complex, context-dependent linguistic queries to achieve pixel-level localization. Current dominant approaches rely heavily on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) or Reinforcement Learning (RL). However, SFT suffers from catastrophic forgetting and domain dependency, while RL is often hindered by training instability and rigid reliance on predefined reward functions. Although recent training-free methods circumvent these training burdens, they are fundamentally limited by a static inference paradigm. These methods typically rely on a single-pass "generate-then-segment" chain, which suffers from insufficient reasoning depth and lacks the capability to self-correct linguistic hallucinations or spatial misinterpretations. In this paper, we challenge these limitations and propose EVOL-SAM3, a novel zero-shot framework that reformulates reasoning segmentation as an inference-time evolutionary search process. Instead of relying on a fixed prompt, EVOL-SAM3 maintains a population of prompt hypotheses and iteratively refines them through a "Generate-Evaluate-Evolve" loop. We introduce a Visual Arena to assess prompt fitness via reference-free pairwise tournaments, and a Semantic Mutation operator to inject diversity and correct semantic errors. Furthermore, a Heterogeneous Arena module integrates geometric priors with semantic reasoning to ensure robust final selection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EVOL-SAM3 not only substantially outperforms static baselines but also significantly surpasses fully supervised state-of-the-art methods on the challenging ReasonSeg benchmark in a zero-shot setting.

TL;DR: 提出了FlowBlending分阶段采样策略，用大小模型组合在保持生成质量前提下实现1.65倍加速和57.35%算力节省


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模型容量需求存在时空异质性：早期/晚期阶段需要大模型但中间阶段可用小模型替代，现有方法未充分利用该特性

Method: 构建大小模型混合架构，通过velocity-divergence分析动态划分阶段边界，采用大模型（阶段1/3）-小模型（阶段2）交替生成策略

Result: 在LTX-Video/WAN2.1模型上实现：1) 推理加速1.65倍/算力节省57.35%；2) 视觉质量/时间连贯性/语义一致性无损；3) 与现有加速技术叠加可实现2倍额外加速

Conclusion: 阶段感知的混合模型架构可有效平衡生成质量与计算效率，velocity-divergence分析为动态调整模型规模提供有效依据

Abstract: In this work, we show that the impact of model capacity varies across timesteps: it is crucial for the early and late stages but largely negligible during the intermediate stage. Accordingly, we propose FlowBlending, a stage-aware multi-model sampling strategy that employs a large model and a small model at capacity-sensitive stages and intermediate stages, respectively. We further introduce simple criteria to choose stage boundaries and provide a velocity-divergence analysis as an effective proxy for identifying capacity-sensitive regions. Across LTX-Video (2B/13B) and WAN 2.1 (1.3B/14B), FlowBlending achieves up to 1.65x faster inference with 57.35% fewer FLOPs, while maintaining the visual fidelity, temporal coherence, and semantic alignment of the large models. FlowBlending is also compatible with existing sampling-acceleration techniques, enabling up to 2x additional speedup.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VT2A方法存在视觉与文本条件失衡、缺乏细粒度可控生成定义、依赖简短标签导致指令理解不足的三大问题，需建立更平衡且可控的多模态音频生成系统。

Method: 构建符号化声音事件表示框架（含时间/对象/交互方式三要素），发布含6,000+专家标注三元组的EchoFoley-6k数据集，并设计基于慢速思维（语义分解）与快速思维（联合生成）的EchoVidia事件中心框架。

Abstract: Sound effects build an essential layer of multimodal storytelling, shaping the emotional atmosphere and the narrative semantics of videos. Despite recent advancement in video-text-to-audio (VT2A), the current formulation faces three key limitations: First, an imbalance between visual and textual conditioning that leads to visual dominance; Second, the absence of a concrete definition for fine-grained controllable generation; Third, weak instruction understanding and following, as existing datasets rely on brief categorical tags. To address these limitations, we introduce EchoFoley, a new task designed for video-grounded sound generation with both event level local control and hierarchical semantic control. Our symbolic representation for sounding events specifies when, what, and how each sound is produced within a video or instruction, enabling fine-grained controls like sound generation, insertion, and editing. To support this task, we construct EchoFoley-6k, a large-scale, expert-curated benchmark containing over 6,000 video-instruction-annotation triplets. Building upon this foundation, we propose EchoVidia a sounding-event-centric agentic generation framework with slow-fast thinking strategy. Experiments show that EchoVidia surpasses recent VT2A models by 40.7% in controllability and 12.5% in perceptual quality.

Abstract: The recent advent of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has marked a significant breakthrough in real-time novel view synthesis. However, the rapid proliferation of 3DGS-based algorithms has created a pressing need for standardized and comprehensive evaluation tools, especially for compression task. Existing benchmarks often lack the specific metrics necessary to holistically assess the unique characteristics of different methods, such as rendering speed, rate distortion trade-offs memory efficiency, and geometric accuracy. To address this gap, we introduce Splatwizard, a unified benchmark toolkit designed specifically for benchmarking 3DGS compression models. Splatwizard provides an easy-to-use framework to implement new 3DGS compression model and utilize state-of-the-art techniques proposed by previous work. Besides, an integrated pipeline that automates the calculation of key performance indicators, including image-based quality metrics, chamfer distance of reconstruct mesh, rendering frame rates, and computational resource consumption is included in the framework as well.

Conclusion: 证明单阶段嵌入学习+边界感知优化的有效性，但依赖预训练3DGS，在动态场景泛化性受限，未来将探索动态高斯更新策略。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have advanced novel-view synthesis. Recent methods extend multi-view 2D segmentation to 3D, enabling instance/semantic segmentation for better scene understanding. A key challenge is the inconsistency of 2D instance labels across views, leading to poor 3D predictions. Existing methods use a two-stage approach in which some rely on contrastive learning with hyperparameter-sensitive clustering, while others preprocess labels for consistency. We propose a unified framework that merges these steps, reducing training time and improving performance by introducing a learnable feature embedding for segmentation in Gaussian primitives. This embedding is then efficiently decoded into instance labels through a novel "Embedding-to-Label" process, effectively integrating the optimization. While this unified framework offers substantial benefits, we observed artifacts at the object boundaries. To address the object boundary issues, we propose hard-mining samples along these boundaries. However, directly applying hard mining to the feature embeddings proved unstable. Therefore, we apply a linear layer to the rasterized feature embeddings before calculating the triplet loss, which stabilizes training and significantly improves performance. Our method outperforms baselines qualitatively and quantitatively on the ScanNet, Replica3D, and Messy-Rooms datasets.

Motivation: DNN在单目深度估计中的应用存在脆弱性威胁，需验证其对抗攻击风险并提升模型鲁棒性。

Method: 采用物理闭环优化（PITL）结合分布式协方差矩阵自适应进化策略，在真实环境中进行对抗样本生成。

Result: 实验证实生成的对抗样本成功引发深度误判，造成目标场景物体部分区域消失。

Conclusion: 揭示了深度估计模型的脆弱性，验证了物理域对抗攻击的有效性，并凸显了实际场景中鲁棒性的必要性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that cause misclassification when specific perturbations are added to input images. This vulnerability also threatens the reliability of DNN-based monocular depth estimation (MDE) models, making robustness enhancement a critical need in practical applications. To validate the vulnerability of DNN-based MDE models, this study proposes a projection-based adversarial attack method that projects perturbation light onto a target object. The proposed method employs physics-in-the-loop (PITL) optimization -- evaluating candidate solutions in actual environments to account for device specifications and disturbances -- and utilizes a distributed covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy. Experiments confirmed that the proposed method successfully created adversarial examples that lead to depth misestimations, resulting in parts of objects disappearing from the target scene.

### [71] [Nonlinear Noise2Noise for Efficient Monte Carlo Denoiser Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24794)
*Andrew Tinits,Stephen Mann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 文章提出了一种改进的Noise2Noise方法，通过理论框架筛选具有最小偏差的非线性函数，使去噪模型能在仅使用噪声数据训练时仍保持性能，尤其在蒙特卡洛渲染的高动态范围（HDR）图像去噪中表现显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Noise2Noise方法因非线性函数导致噪声目标期望值偏离干净图像而受限，而图像处理中非线性函数（如色调映射）不可或缺。需找到在不引入显著偏差的前提下兼容非线性处理的训练策略。

Method: 建立理论框架分析非线性函数对去噪效果的影响，定义并筛选可最小化偏差的非线性函数类别；提出损失函数与色调映射函数的组合策略以抑制HDR图像训练中的离群值影响。

Result: 在蒙特卡洛去噪器上的实验表明，改进后的Noise2Noise方法在仅使用噪声训练数据时，性能接近原依赖高采样参考图像的模型，且成功应用于HDR图像动态范围压缩。

Conclusion: 研究证明特定非线性函数与损失函数组合可在保持训练效果的同时避免偏差，拓宽了Noise2Noise方法的预处理兼容性，为噪声数据训练提供更灵活的选择。

Abstract: The Noise2Noise method allows for training machine learning-based denoisers with pairs of input and target images where both the input and target can be noisy. This removes the need for training with clean target images, which can be difficult to obtain. However, Noise2Noise training has a major limitation: nonlinear functions applied to the noisy targets will skew the results. This bias occurs because the nonlinearity makes the expected value of the noisy targets different from the clean target image. Since nonlinear functions are common in image processing, avoiding them limits the types of preprocessing that can be performed on the noisy targets. Our main insight is that certain nonlinear functions can be applied to the noisy targets without adding significant bias to the results. We develop a theoretical framework for analyzing the effects of these nonlinearities, and describe a class of nonlinear functions with minimal bias.
  We demonstrate our method on the denoising of high dynamic range (HDR) images produced by Monte Carlo rendering. Noise2Noise training can have trouble with HDR images, where the training process is overwhelmed by outliers and performs poorly. We consider a commonly used method of addressing these training issues: applying a nonlinear tone mapping function to the model output and target images to reduce their dynamic range. This method was previously thought to be incompatible with Noise2Noise training because of the nonlinearities involved. We show that certain combinations of loss functions and tone mapping functions can reduce the effect of outliers while introducing minimal bias. We apply our method to an existing machine learning-based Monte Carlo denoiser, where the original implementation was trained with high-sample count reference images. Our results approach those of the original implementation, but are produced using only noisy training data.

Abstract: Cross-modal systems trained on 2D visual inputs are presented with a dimensional shift when processing 3D scenes. An in-scene camera bridges the dimensionality gap but requires learning a control module. We introduce a new method that improves multivariate mutual information estimates by regret minimisation with derivative-free optimisation. Our algorithm enables off-the-shelf cross-modal systems trained on 2D visual inputs to adapt online to object occlusions and differentiate features. The pairing of expressive measures and value-based optimisation assists control of an in-scene camera to learn directly from the noisy outputs of vision-language models. The resulting pipeline improves performance in cross-modal tasks on multi-object 3D scenes without resorting to pretraining or finetuning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CropTrack是一种结合外观与运动信息的新型多目标跟踪框架，用于解决农业环境中因遮挡、外观相似等问题带来的跟踪挑战，通过重排序增强的外观关联等方法显著提升跟踪性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 农业环境中的多目标跟踪因重复模式、物体外观相似、光照突变和频繁遮挡而困难，当前依赖运动关联的方法难以应对强遮挡场景，且外观相似导致外观关联难以有效整合。

Method: 提出CropTrack框架，融合外观与运动信息：（1）重排序增强的外观关联；（2）基于外观的一对多关联与冲突解决策略；（3）采用指数移动平均原型特征库优化外观关联。

Result: 在公开农业MOT数据集上，CropTrack表现出稳定的ID保持能力，相较传统运动跟踪方法，识别F1分数和关联准确率显著提升，ID切换数量减少。

Conclusion: 整合外观与运动关联的CropTrack在复杂农业环境中优于现有方法，验证了其在频繁遮挡和相似外观场景下的有效性。

Abstract: Multiple-object tracking (MOT) in agricultural environments presents major challenges due to repetitive patterns, similar object appearances, sudden illumination changes, and frequent occlusions. Contemporary trackers in this domain rely on the motion of objects rather than appearance for association. Nevertheless, they struggle to maintain object identities when targets undergo frequent and strong occlusions. The high similarity of object appearances makes integrating appearance-based association nontrivial for agricultural scenarios. To solve this problem we propose CropTrack, a novel MOT framework based on the combination of appearance and motion information. CropTrack integrates a reranking-enhanced appearance association, a one-to-many association with appearance-based conflict resolution strategy, and an exponential moving average prototype feature bank to improve appearance-based association. Evaluated on publicly available agricultural MOT datasets, CropTrack demonstrates consistent identity preservation, outperforming traditional motion-based tracking methods. Compared to the state of the art, CropTrack achieves significant gains in identification F1 and association accuracy scores with a lower number of identity switches.

*Xunyi Zhao,Gengze Zhou,Qi Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces VLN-MME, a framework for evaluating MLLMs as embodied agents in navigation tasks, revealing that while MLLMs can follow instructions, their 3D spatial reasoning and sequential decision-making remain limited despite enhancements like Chain-of-Thought reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs excel in vision-language tasks but lack exploration in embodied navigation scenarios requiring multi-step dialogue and spatial reasoning, prompting the need for a standardized benchmark to assess their capabilities in this domain.

Method: Developed VLN-MME, a modular framework that adapts traditional navigation datasets into a unified benchmark, enabling zero-shot evaluation of MLLMs through structured comparisons, ablation studies, and agent design tests.

Result: Baseline agents with Chain-of-Thought and self-reflection showed reduced performance, highlighting MLLMs' poor context awareness and low 3D spatial reasoning fidelity despite adequate instruction-following abilities.

Conclusion: VLN-MME establishes a systematic approach for evaluating MLLMs in embodied navigation, exposing critical limitations in sequential decision-making and offering foundational insights for improving their real-world deployment through targeted post-training strategies.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of vision-language tasks. However, their performance as embodied agents, which requires multi-round dialogue spatial reasoning and sequential action prediction, needs further exploration. Our work investigates this potential in the context of Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) by introducing a unified and extensible evaluation framework to probe MLLMs as zero-shot agents by bridging traditional navigation datasets into a standardized benchmark, named VLN-MME. We simplify the evaluation with a highly modular and accessible design. This flexibility streamlines experiments, enabling structured comparisons and component-level ablations across diverse MLLM architectures, agent designs, and navigation tasks. Crucially, enabled by our framework, we observe that enhancing our baseline agent with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and self-reflection leads to an unexpected performance decrease. This suggests MLLMs exhibit poor context awareness in embodied navigation tasks; although they can follow instructions and structure their output, their 3D spatial reasoning fidelity is low. VLN-MME lays the groundwork for systematic evaluation of general-purpose MLLMs in embodied navigation settings and reveals limitations in their sequential decision-making capabilities. We believe these findings offer crucial guidance for MLLM post-training as embodied agents.

Abstract: We introduce FinMMDocR, a novel bilingual multimodal benchmark for evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) on real-world financial numerical reasoning. Compared to existing benchmarks, our work delivers three major advancements. (1) Scenario Awareness: 57.9% of 1,200 expert-annotated problems incorporate 12 types of implicit financial scenarios (e.g., Portfolio Management), challenging models to perform expert-level reasoning based on assumptions; (2) Document Understanding: 837 Chinese/English documents spanning 9 types (e.g., Company Research) average 50.8 pages with rich visual elements, significantly surpassing existing benchmarks in both breadth and depth of financial documents; (3) Multi-Step Computation: Problems demand 11-step reasoning on average (5.3 extraction + 5.7 calculation steps), with 65.0% requiring cross-page evidence (2.4 pages average). The best-performing MLLM achieves only 58.0% accuracy, and different retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods show significant performance variations on this task. We expect FinMMDocR to drive improvements in MLLMs and reasoning-enhanced methods on complex multimodal reasoning tasks in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: 3D object detectors are fundamental components of perception systems in autonomous vehicles. While these detectors achieve remarkable performance on standard autonomous driving benchmarks, they often struggle to generalize across different domains - for instance, a model trained in the U.S. may perform poorly in regions like Asia or Europe. This paper presents a novel lidar domain adaptation method based on neuron activation patterns, demonstrating that state-of-the-art performance can be achieved by annotating only a small, representative, and diverse subset of samples from the target domain if they are correctly selected. The proposed approach requires very small annotation budget and, when combined with post-training techniques inspired by continual learning prevent weight drift from the original model. Empirical evaluation shows that the proposed domain adaptation approach outperforms both linear probing and state-of-the-art domain adaptation techniques.

Abstract: Existing open-source film restoration methods show limited performance compared to commercial methods due to training with low-quality synthetic data and employing noisy optical flows. In addition, high-resolution films have not been explored by the open-source methods.We propose HaineiFRDM(Film Restoration Diffusion Model), a film restoration framework, to explore diffusion model's powerful content-understanding ability to help human expert better restore indistinguishable film defects.Specifically, we employ a patch-wise training and testing strategy to make restoring high-resolution films on one 24GB-VRAMR GPU possible and design a position-aware Global Prompt and Frame Fusion Modules.Also, we introduce a global-local frequency module to reconstruct consistent textures among different patches. Besides, we firstly restore a low-resolution result and use it as global residual to mitigate blocky artifacts caused by patching process.Furthermore, we construct a film restoration dataset that contains restored real-degraded films and realistic synthetic data.Comprehensive experimental results conclusively demonstrate the superiority of our model in defect restoration ability over existing open-source methods.

Result: 实验表明该方法显著提升CAC评分精度、病灶空间保真度及临床可用性。

Conclusion: 渐进式钙敏感框架可从常规CT实现可靠CAC量化，推动心血管风险分层应用。

Abstract: Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring from chest CT is a well-established tool to stratify and refine clinical cardiovascular disease risk estimation. CAC quantification relies on the accurate delineation of calcified lesions, but is oftentimes affected by artifacts introduced by cardiac and respiratory motion. ECG-gated cardiac CTs substantially reduce motion artifacts, but their use in population screening and routine imaging remains limited due to gating requirements and lack of insurance coverage. Although identification of incidental CAC from non-gated chest CT is increasingly considered for it offers an accessible and widely available alternative, this modality is limited by more severe motion artifacts. We present ProDM (Property-aware Progressive Correction Diffusion Model), a generative diffusion framework that restores motion-free calcified lesions from non-gated CTs. ProDM introduces three key components: (1) a CAC motion simulation data engine that synthesizes realistic non-gated acquisitions with diverse motion trajectories directly from cardiac-gated CTs, enabling supervised training without paired data; (2) a property-aware learning strategy incorporating calcium-specific priors through a differentiable calcium consistency loss to preserve lesion integrity; and (3) a progressive correction scheme that reduces artifacts gradually across diffusion steps to enhance stability and calcium fidelity. Experiments on real patient datasets show that ProDM significantly improves CAC scoring accuracy, spatial lesion fidelity, and risk stratification performance compared with several baselines. A reader study on real non-gated scans further confirms that ProDM suppresses motion artifacts and improves clinical usability. These findings highlight the potential of progressive, property-aware frameworks for reliable CAC quantification from routine chest CT imaging.

While these models show promise for Generative Video Reasoning (GVR), existing evaluation frameworks often rely on single-frame assessments, which can lead to outcome-hacking, where a model reaches a correct conclusion through an erroneous process. To address this, we propose a process-aware evaluation paradigm. We introduce VIPER, a comprehensive benchmark spanning 16 tasks across temporal, structural, symbolic, spatial, physics, and planning reasoning. Furthermore, we propose Process-outcome Consistency (POC@r), a new metric that utilizes VLM-as-Judge with a hierarchical rubric to evaluate both the validity of the intermediate steps and the final result. Our experiments reveal that state-of-the-art video models achieve only about 20% POC@1.0 and exhibit a significant outcome-hacking. We further explore the impact of test-time scaling and sampling robustness, highlighting a substantial gap between current video generation and true generalized visual reasoning. Our benchmark will be publicly released.

*Siyuan Hu,Kevin Qinghong Lin,Mike Zheng Shou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ShowUI-π introduces the first flow-based generative model for GUI agents to handle both discrete clicks and continuous drags, achieving superior performance on the ScreenDrag benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GUI agents struggle with continuous drag actions requiring closed-loop trajectories, prompting the need for a model that can unify discrete and continuous interactions using visual observations for dexterous digital control.

Method: Proposed innovations include Unified Discrete-Continuous Actions, Flow-Based Action Generation for drag modeling via lightweight visual expert, and the ScreenDrag benchmark with 20K drag trajectories across five domains (e.g., PowerPoint).

Result: ShowUI-π outperforms existing agents on ScreenDrag (26.98 score vs. Gemini-2.5-CUA's 22.18) with 450M parameters, highlighting task difficulty and method effectiveness.

Conclusion: The work advances GUI agents toward human-like dexterous control in digital environments by addressing limitations in continuous action execution and evaluation benchmarks.

Abstract: Building intelligent agents capable of dexterous manipulation is essential for achieving human-like automation in both robotics and digital environments. However, existing GUI agents rely on discrete click predictions (x,y), which prohibits free-form, closed-loop trajectories (e.g. dragging a progress bar) that require continuous, on-the-fly perception and adjustment. In this work, we develop ShowUI-$π$, the first flow-based generative model as GUI dexterous hand, featuring the following designs: (i) Unified Discrete-Continuous Actions, integrating discrete clicks and continuous drags within a shared model, enabling flexible adaptation across diverse interaction modes; (ii) Flow-based Action Generation for drag modeling, which predicts incremental cursor adjustments from continuous visual observations via a lightweight action expert, ensuring smooth and stable trajectories; (iii) Drag Training data and Benchmark, where we manually collect and synthesize 20K drag trajectories across five domains (e.g. PowerPoint, Adobe Premiere Pro), and introduce ScreenDrag, a benchmark with comprehensive online and offline evaluation protocols for assessing GUI agents' drag capabilities. Our experiments show that proprietary GUI agents still struggle on ScreenDrag (e.g. Operator scores 13.27, and the best Gemini-2.5-CUA reaches 22.18). In contrast, ShowUI-$π$ achieves 26.98 with only 450M parameters, underscoring both the difficulty of the task and the effectiveness of our approach. We hope this work advances GUI agents toward human-like dexterous control in digital world. The code is available at https://github.com/showlab/showui-pi.

Conclusion: DarkEQA填补了VLM全天候鲁棒性评估空白，其光照物理建模方法为感知模块压力测试提供新范式，推动低光环境视觉-语言推理系统的发展

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly adopted as central reasoning modules for embodied agents. Existing benchmarks evaluate their capabilities under ideal, well-lit conditions, yet robust 24/7 operation demands performance under a wide range of visual degradations, including low-light conditions at night or in dark environments--a core necessity that has been largely overlooked. To address this underexplored challenge, we present DarkEQA, an open-source benchmark for evaluating EQA-relevant perceptual primitives under multi-level low-light conditions. DarkEQA isolates the perception bottleneck by evaluating question answering from egocentric observations under controlled degradations, enabling attributable robustness analysis. A key design feature of DarkEQA is its physical fidelity: visual degradations are modeled in linear RAW space, simulating physics-based illumination drop and sensor noise followed by an ISP-inspired rendering pipeline. We demonstrate the utility of DarkEQA by evaluating a wide range of state-of-the-art VLMs and Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE) models. Our analysis systematically reveals VLMs' limitations when operating under these challenging visual conditions. Our code and benchmark dataset will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Lifelong person Re-IDentification (L-ReID) exploits sequentially collected data to continuously train and update a ReID model, focusing on the overall performance of all data. Its main challenge is to avoid the catastrophic forgetting problem of old knowledge while training on new data. Existing L-ReID methods typically re-extract new features for all historical gallery images for inference after each update, known as "re-indexing". However, historical gallery data typically suffers from direct saving due to the data privacy issue and the high re-indexing costs for large-scale gallery images. As a result, it inevitably leads to incompatible retrieval between query features extracted by the updated model and gallery features extracted by those before the update, greatly impairing the re-identification performance. To tackle the above issue, this paper focuses on a new task called Re-index Free Lifelong person Re-IDentification (RFL-ReID), which requires performing lifelong person re-identification without re-indexing historical gallery images. Therefore, RFL-ReID is more challenging than L-ReID, requiring continuous learning and balancing new and old knowledge in diverse streaming data, and making the features output by the new and old models compatible with each other. To this end, we propose a Bidirectional Continuous Compatible Representation (Bi-C2R) framework to continuously update the gallery features extracted by the old model to perform efficient L-ReID in a compatible manner. We verify our proposed Bi-C2R method through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, which demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve leading performance on both the introduced RFL-ReID task and the traditional L-ReID task.

Conclusion: 通过重构为视频编辑任务与创新训练策略，该方法克服了传统inpainting范式的固有缺陷，建立了新的视觉配音技术基准。

Abstract: Audio-driven visual dubbing aims to synchronize a video's lip movements with new speech, but is fundamentally challenged by the lack of ideal training data: paired videos where only a subject's lip movements differ while all other visual conditions are identical. Existing methods circumvent this with a mask-based inpainting paradigm, where an incomplete visual conditioning forces models to simultaneously hallucinate missing content and sync lips, leading to visual artifacts, identity drift, and poor synchronization. In this work, we propose a novel self-bootstrapping framework that reframes visual dubbing from an ill-posed inpainting task into a well-conditioned video-to-video editing problem. Our approach employs a Diffusion Transformer, first as a data generator, to synthesize ideal training data: a lip-altered companion video for each real sample, forming visually aligned video pairs. A DiT-based audio-driven editor is then trained on these pairs end-to-end, leveraging the complete and aligned input video frames to focus solely on precise, audio-driven lip modifications. This complete, frame-aligned input conditioning forms a rich visual context for the editor, providing it with complete identity cues, scene interactions, and continuous spatiotemporal dynamics. Leveraging this rich context fundamentally enables our method to achieve highly accurate lip sync, faithful identity preservation, and exceptional robustness against challenging in-the-wild scenarios. We further introduce a timestep-adaptive multi-phase learning strategy as a necessary component to disentangle conflicting editing objectives across diffusion timesteps, thereby facilitating stable training and yielding enhanced lip synchronization and visual fidelity. Additionally, we propose ContextDubBench, a comprehensive benchmark dataset for robust evaluation in diverse and challenging practical application scenarios.

Conclusion: FineTec通过时空-物理联合建模，在严重噪声环境下仍能保持动作识别鲁棒性，为现实场景应用提供有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recognizing fine-grained actions from temporally corrupted skeleton sequences remains a significant challenge, particularly in real-world scenarios where online pose estimation often yields substantial missing data. Existing methods often struggle to accurately recover temporal dynamics and fine-grained spatial structures, resulting in the loss of subtle motion cues crucial for distinguishing similar actions. To address this, we propose FineTec, a unified framework for Fine-grained action recognition under Temporal Corruption. FineTec first restores a base skeleton sequence from corrupted input using context-aware completion with diverse temporal masking. Next, a skeleton-based spatial decomposition module partitions the skeleton into five semantic regions, further divides them into dynamic and static subgroups based on motion variance, and generates two augmented skeleton sequences via targeted perturbation. These, along with the base sequence, are then processed by a physics-driven estimation module, which utilizes Lagrangian dynamics to estimate joint accelerations. Finally, both the fused skeleton position sequence and the fused acceleration sequence are jointly fed into a GCN-based action recognition head. Extensive experiments on both coarse-grained (NTU-60, NTU-120) and fine-grained (Gym99, Gym288) benchmarks show that FineTec significantly outperforms previous methods under various levels of temporal corruption. Specifically, FineTec achieves top-1 accuracies of 89.1% and 78.1% on the challenging Gym99-severe and Gym288-severe settings, respectively, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability.

Conclusion: 该方法证明了零样本多视角外绘的有效性，为稀疏视角重建提供了兼顾几何一致性、重建质量与计算效率的新范式。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D reconstruction have achieved remarkable progress in high-quality scene capture from dense multi-view imagery, yet struggle when input views are limited. Various approaches, including regularization techniques, semantic priors, and geometric constraints, have been implemented to address this challenge. Latest diffusion-based methods have demonstrated substantial improvements by generating novel views from new camera poses to augment training data, surpassing earlier regularization and prior-based techniques. Despite this progress, we identify three critical limitations in these state-of-the-art approaches: inadequate coverage beyond known view peripheries, geometric inconsistencies across generated views, and computationally expensive pipelines. We introduce GaMO (Geometry-aware Multi-view Outpainter), a framework that reformulates sparse-view reconstruction through multi-view outpainting. Instead of generating new viewpoints, GaMO expands the field of view from existing camera poses, which inherently preserves geometric consistency while providing broader scene coverage. Our approach employs multi-view conditioning and geometry-aware denoising strategies in a zero-shot manner without training. Extensive experiments on Replica and ScanNet++ demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstruction quality across 3, 6, and 9 input views, outperforming prior methods in PSNR and LPIPS, while achieving a $25\times$ speedup over SOTA diffusion-based methods with processing time under 10 minutes.

Result: 在真实和合成数据集上显著提升时序控制精度，表现优于先前方法。

Conclusion: 该模型通过协同训练时序变形策略和CamxTime数据集，实现了精确的时空解耦与可控视频生成。

Abstract: We present SpaceTimePilot, a video diffusion model that disentangles space and time for controllable generative rendering. Given a monocular video, SpaceTimePilot can independently alter the camera viewpoint and the motion sequence within the generative process, re-rendering the scene for continuous and arbitrary exploration across space and time. To achieve this, we introduce an effective animation time-embedding mechanism in the diffusion process, allowing explicit control of the output video's motion sequence with respect to that of the source video. As no datasets provide paired videos of the same dynamic scene with continuous temporal variations, we propose a simple yet effective temporal-warping training scheme that repurposes existing multi-view datasets to mimic temporal differences. This strategy effectively supervises the model to learn temporal control and achieve robust space-time disentanglement. To further enhance the precision of dual control, we introduce two additional components: an improved camera-conditioning mechanism that allows altering the camera from the first frame, and CamxTime, the first synthetic space-and-time full-coverage rendering dataset that provides fully free space-time video trajectories within a scene. Joint training on the temporal-warping scheme and the CamxTime dataset yields more precise temporal control. We evaluate SpaceTimePilot on both real-world and synthetic data, demonstrating clear space-time disentanglement and strong results compared to prior work.

Conclusion: CAT框架提供动态评估视角，有助于开发兼顾准确性与鲁棒性的LLM系统，方法论可扩展至各类NLP任务

Abstract: We introduce \textsc{CAT}, a framework designed to evaluate and visualize the \emph{interplay} of \emph{accuracy} and \emph{response consistency} of Large Language Models (LLMs) under controllable input variations, using multiple-choice (MC) benchmarks as a case study. Current evaluation practices primarily focus on model capabilities such as accuracy or benchmark scores and, more recently, measuring consistency is being considered an essential property for deploying LLMs in high-stake, real-world applications. We argue in this paper that although both dimensions should still be evaluated independently, their inter-dependency also need to be considered for a more nuanced evaluation of LLMs. At the core of \textsc{CAT} are the \emph{Consistency-Accuracy Relation (CAR)} curves, which visualize how model accuracy varies with increasing consistency requirements, as defined by the \emph{Minimum-Consistency Accuracy (MCA)} metric. We further propose the \emph{Consistency-Oriented Robustness Estimate (CORE)} index, a global metric that combines the area and shape of the CAR curve to quantify the trade-off between accuracy and consistency. We present a practical demonstration of our framework across a diverse set of generalist and domain-specific LLMs, evaluated on multiple MC benchmarks. We also outline how \textsc{CAT} can be extended beyond MC tasks to support long-form, open-ended evaluations through adaptable scoring functions.

Abstract: LLMs excel at code generation from English prompts, but this progress has not extended to low-resource languages. We address Bangla-to-Python code generation by introducing BanglaCodeAct, an agent-based framework that leverages multi-agent prompting and iterative self-correction. Unlike prior approaches relying on task-specific fine-tuning, BanglaCodeAct employs an open-source multilingual LLM within a Thought-Code-Observation loop, enabling dynamic generation, testing, and refinement of code from Bangla instructions. We benchmark several small-parameter open-source LLMs and evaluate their effectiveness on the mHumanEval dataset for Bangla NL2Code. Our results show that Qwen3-8B, when deployed with BanglaCodeAct, achieves the best performance, with pass@1 accuracy of 94.0\% on the development set and 71.6\% on the blind test set. These results establish a new benchmark for Bangla-to-Python translation and highlight the potential of agent-based reasoning for reliable code generation in low-resource languages.

Conclusion: PharmaShip为医药领域文档理解提供了可复现基准，发现序列感知约束对结构建模具通用价值，数据集已开源

Abstract: We present PharmaShip, a real-world Chinese dataset of scanned pharmaceutical shipping documents designed to stress-test pre-trained text-layout models under noisy OCR and heterogeneous templates. PharmaShip covers three complementary tasks-sequence entity recognition (SER), relation extraction (RE), and reading order prediction (ROP)-and adopts an entity-centric evaluation protocol to minimize confounds across architectures. We benchmark five representative baselines spanning pixel-aware and geometry-aware families (LiLT, LayoutLMv3-base, GeoLayoutLM and their available RORE-enhanced variants), and standardize preprocessing, splits, and optimization. Experiments show that pixels and explicit geometry provide complementary inductive biases, yet neither alone is sufficient: injecting reading-order-oriented regularization consistently improves SER and EL and yields the most robust configuration, while longer positional coverage stabilizes late-page predictions and reduces truncation artifacts. ROP is accurate at the word level but challenging at the segment level, reflecting boundary ambiguity and long-range crossings. PharmaShip thus establishes a controlled, reproducible benchmark for safety-critical document understanding in the pharmaceutical domain and highlights sequence-aware constraints as a transferable bias for structure modeling. We release the dataset at https://github.com/KevinYuLei/PharmaShip.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Luca-Noise Reflex Protocol (LN-RP), a computational framework for analyzing noise-driven persona emergence in large language models. By injecting stochastic noise seeds into the initial generation state, we observe nonlinear transitions in linguistic behavior across 152 generation cycles. Our results reveal three stable persona modes with distinct entropy signatures, and demonstrate that external noise sources can reliably induce phase transitions in reflexive generation dynamics. Quantitative evaluation confirms consistent persona retention and significant differences across modes (p < 0.01). The protocol provides a reproducible method for studying reflexive generation, emergent behavior, and longrange linguistic coherence in LLMs.

Motivation: 现有安全机制过度关注显性威胁，但用户可通过语义重构保持恶意目的的同时规避检测，这导致安全训练数据存在重大缺陷

Method: 构建多智能体辩论系统，采用批判与迭代优化机制，系统化将明显恶意查询转化为隐蔽形式，同时保持其有害意图的核心结构

Result: 实验表明该框架显著优于传统基线方法，能够生成高质量、隐蔽性的恶意查询变体，但辩论过程可能引发主题偏移和过拟合复杂度

Conclusion: 多智能体辩论在增强对抗样本生成能力的同时，也暴露出安全训练数据构建中需要权衡的潜在复杂性和方向偏移问题

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are equipped with safety mechanisms to detect and block harmful queries, yet current alignment approaches primarily focus on overtly dangerous content and overlook more subtle threats. However, users can often disguise harmful intent through covert rephrasing that preserves malicious objectives while appearing benign, which creates a significant gap in existing safety training data. To address this limitation, we introduce HarmTransform, a multi-agent debate framework for systematically transforming harmful queries into stealthier forms while preserving their underlying harmful intent. Our framework leverages iterative critique and refinement among multiple agents to generate high-quality, covert harmful query transformations that can be used to improve future LLM safety alignment. Experiments demonstrate that HarmTransform significantly outperforms standard baselines in producing effective query transformations. At the same time, our analysis reveals that debate acts as a double-edged sword: while it can sharpen transformations and improve stealth, it may also introduce topic shifts and unnecessary complexity. These insights highlight both the promise and the limitations of multi-agent debate for generating comprehensive safety training data.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs pretrained on poker data can learn internal representations of both deterministic and stochastic game elements without explicit instruction, demonstrating capabilities in handling partially observable environments like poker.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs have shown emergent world modeling in perfect-information games, it remains unexplored whether they can learn similar representations in partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) such as poker, which requires reasoning under uncertainty.

Method: A GPT-style model was pre-trained on Poker Hand History data, and nonlinear probes were applied to analyze its internal activations, testing whether it learns hand ranks (deterministic), equity calculations (stochastic), and belief-state correlates.

Result: The model learns both deterministic features (hand rankings) and stochastic features (equity estimates) without explicit supervision, with nonlinear probes revealing decodable representations correlating with theoretical poker belief states.

Conclusion: Transformer-based LLMs can form internal representations of stochastic environments and partial information scenarios, suggesting they develop implicit probabilistic reasoning capabilities in domains like poker.

Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning abilities across diverse fields, from solving programming challenges to competing in strategy-intensive games such as chess. Prior work has shown that LLMs can develop emergent world models in games of perfect information, where internal representations correspond to latent states of the environment. In this paper, we extend this line of investigation to domains of incomplete information, focusing on poker as a canonical partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). We pretrain a GPT-style model on Poker Hand History (PHH) data and probe its internal activations. Our results demonstrate that the model learns both deterministic structure, such as hand ranks, and stochastic features, such as equity, without explicit instruction. Furthermore, by using primarily nonlinear probes, we demonstrated that these representations are decodeable and correlate with theoretical belief states, suggesting that LLMs are learning their own representation of the stochastic environment of Texas Hold'em Poker.

TL;DR: 该论文提出一种两阶段框架，解决在线性别歧视内容检测中的数据不足、噪声和概念模糊问题，通过结合针对性训练与推理机制提升检测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线性别歧视内容日益隐晦且依赖上下文，传统检测方法效果有限。标签稀缺、类别不平衡及数据与模型预测的模糊性导致模型难以识别细微歧视形式，亟需兼顾数据不足、噪声及概念模糊的新框架。

Method: 训练阶段采用类别平衡焦点损失、类别感知批处理及后阈值校准减轻标签不平衡与噪声干扰；推理阶段通过动态路由机制分离高置信度与不确定样本，后者交由包含多角色专家协作与法官模型整合推理的CEJ模块处理。

Result: 在EXIST 2025 Task 1.1中F1得分提升2.72%，EDOS任务A/B分别提升4.48%和1.30%，达到新基准。

Conclusion: 提出的两阶段框架通过针对性训练与基于推理的选择性推断，有效应对了数据稀缺、噪声和概念模糊挑战，为隐性性别歧视检测提供了先进解决方案。

Abstract: Sexist content online increasingly appears in subtle, context-dependent forms that evade traditional detection methods. Its interpretation often depends on overlapping linguistic, psychological, legal, and cultural dimensions, which produce mixed and sometimes contradictory signals, even in annotated datasets. These inconsistencies, combined with label scarcity and class imbalance, result in unstable decision boundaries and cause fine-tuned models to overlook subtler, underrepresented forms of harm. Together, these limitations point to the need for a design that explicitly addresses the combined effects of (i) underrepresentation, (ii) noise, and (iii) conceptual ambiguity in both data and model predictions. To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage framework that unifies (i) targeted training procedures to adapt supervision to scarce and noisy data with (ii) selective, reasoning-based inference to handle ambiguous or borderline cases. Our training setup applies class-balanced focal loss, class-aware batching, and post-hoc threshold calibration to mitigate label imbalance and noisy supervision. At inference time, a dynamic routing mechanism classifies high-confidence cases directly and escalates uncertain instances to a novel \textit{Collaborative Expert Judgment} (CEJ) module, which prompts multiple personas and consolidates their reasoning through a judge model. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results across several benchmarks, with a +2.72\% improvement in F1 on the EXIST 2025 Task 1.1, and a gains of +4.48\% and +1.30\% on the EDOS Tasks A and B, respectively.

### [94] [Entropy-Aware Speculative Decoding Toward Improved LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23765)
*Tiancheng Su,Meicong Zhang,Guoxiu He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EASD enhances SD by adding entropy-based penalties during token generation, reducing errors and achieving superior performance over both SD methods and target LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SD is limited by tight alignment between draft and target models, restricting performance to target LLM capabilities. A training-free method is needed to break this constraint.

Method: EASD extends standard SD by: (1) using entropy to quantify model uncertainty during token prediction; (2) dynamically rejecting low-confidence tokens when both models show high entropy and overlapping top predictions; (3) re-sampling rejected tokens through target LLM to avoid error propagation.

Result: EASD outperforms baseline SD methods on multiple reasoning benchmarks, surpasses target LLM performance in most cases, while maintaining SD-level computational efficiency.

Conclusion: Entropy-aware verification enables draft models to enhance rather than merely approximate target LLMs, proving that dynamic uncertainty assessment can achieve both accuracy and efficiency gains.

Abstract: Speculative decoding (SD) accelerates large language model (LLM) reasoning by using a small draft model to generate candidate tokens, which the target LLM either accepts directly or regenerates upon rejection. However, excessive alignment between the draft and target models constrains SD to the performance of the target LLM. To address this limitation, we propose Entropy-Aware Speculative Decoding (EASD), a training-free enhancement. Building on standard SD, EASD incorporates a dynamic entropy-based penalty. At each decoding step, we employ the entropy of the sampling distribution to quantify model uncertainty. When both models exhibit high entropy with substantial overlap among their top-N predictions, the corresponding token is rejected and re-sampled by the target LLM. This penalty prevents low-confidence errors from propagating. By incorporating draft-model verification, EASD enables the possibility of surpassing the target model's inherent performance. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that EASD consistently outperforms existing SD methods and, in most cases, surpasses the target LLM itself. We further prove that the efficiency of EASD is comparable to that of SD. The code can be found in the Supplementary Materials.

Motivation: 现有音频模型多依赖任务特定微调，而人类仅需少量示例或简单指令即可完成音频任务。受GPT-3在文本领域成功的启发，通过扩展预训练数据提升音频模型泛化性。

Method: 扩展MiMo-Audio预训练数据至1亿+小时，设计系统性评估框架。后训练阶段构建多样性指令微调语料库，并引入音频理解与生成的‘思考机制’。

Result: MiMo-Audio-7B-Base多项开源基准测试达成SOTA，可泛化至训练数据外任务（语音转换、风格迁移、语音编辑），生成高真实感语音续写（脱口秀、朗诵等）。MiMo-Audio-7B-Instruct在指令跟随与对话测试中逼近/超越闭源模型。

Conclusion: 扩展预训练数据规模可赋予音频模型少样本学习能力，有效提升跨任务泛化性与生成质量，为开源音频模型提供可扩展范式。

Abstract: Existing audio language models typically rely on task-specific fine-tuning to accomplish particular audio tasks. In contrast, humans are able to generalize to new audio tasks with only a few examples or simple instructions. GPT-3 has shown that scaling next-token prediction pretraining enables strong generalization capabilities in text, and we believe this paradigm is equally applicable to the audio domain. By scaling MiMo-Audio's pretraining data to over one hundred million of hours, we observe the emergence of few-shot learning capabilities across a diverse set of audio tasks. We develop a systematic evaluation of these capabilities and find that MiMo-Audio-7B-Base achieves SOTA performance on both speech intelligence and audio understanding benchmarks among open-source models. Beyond standard metrics, MiMo-Audio-7B-Base generalizes to tasks absent from its training data, such as voice conversion, style transfer, and speech editing. MiMo-Audio-7B-Base also demonstrates powerful speech continuation capabilities, capable of generating highly realistic talk shows, recitations, livestreaming and debates. At the post-training stage, we curate a diverse instruction-tuning corpus and introduce thinking mechanisms into both audio understanding and generation. MiMo-Audio-7B-Instruct achieves open-source SOTA on audio understanding benchmarks (MMSU, MMAU, MMAR, MMAU-Pro), spoken dialogue benchmarks (Big Bench Audio, MultiChallenge Audio) and instruct-TTS evaluations, approaching or surpassing closed-source models.

Method: 使用SHAP解释对两个模型进行解释性对比研究，通过词级归因分析正确/错误预测的差异以解析模型的偏见证据整合机制

Result: 1. 两个模型关注相似评价语言但整合方式不同 2. 原始模型在误报时分配更强证据导致中性内容过度标记 3. 领域适应模型归因模式更优 4. 误报源于语篇歧义而非显性偏见信号

Conclusion: 需要可解释性评估体系，模型架构和训练策略显著影响新闻业中的可靠性与部署适用性

Abstract: Automated bias detection in news text is heavily used to support journalistic analysis and media accountability, yet little is known about how bias detection models arrive at their decisions or why they fail. In this work, we present a comparative interpretability study of two transformer-based bias detection models: a bias detector fine-tuned on the BABE dataset and a domain-adapted pre-trained RoBERTa model fine-tuned on the BABE dataset, using SHAP-based explanations. We analyze word-level attributions across correct and incorrect predictions to characterize how different model architectures operationalize linguistic bias. Our results show that although both models attend to similar categories of evaluative language, they differ substantially in how these signals are integrated into predictions. The bias detector model assigns stronger internal evidence to false positives than to true positives, indicating a misalignment between attribution strength and prediction correctness and contributing to systematic over-flagging of neutral journalistic content. In contrast, the domain-adaptive model exhibits attribution patterns that better align with prediction outcomes and produces 63\% fewer false positives. We further demonstrate that model errors arise from distinct linguistic mechanisms, with false positives driven by discourse-level ambiguity rather than explicit bias cues. These findings highlight the importance of interpretability-aware evaluation for bias detection systems and suggest that architectural and training choices critically affect both model reliability and deployment suitability in journalistic contexts.

Motivation: 为了解决长上下文导致的无关信息干扰问题，并探究LLM在信息不足时生成错误答案的根本原因。

Method: 将检索信息切分为可调节的小块，逐块提示生成答案。通过调整块大小权衡信息完整性和冗余度，并在三个开放域QA数据集进行验证。

Result: 自适应策略与标准方法表现相当但节省token消耗；分析表明67%的错误源自信息不足时的强行生成。

Conclusion: 分块策略在性能与效率间取得平衡，研究揭示LLM需强化对信息不足场景的主动拒答机制。

Abstract: The success of expanded context windows in Large Language Models (LLMs) has driven increased use of broader context in retrieval-augmented generation. We investigate the use of LLMs for retrieval augmented question answering. While longer contexts make it easier to incorporate targeted knowledge, they introduce more irrelevant information that hinders the model's generation process and degrades its performance. To address the issue, we design an adaptive prompting strategy which involves splitting the retrieved information into smaller chunks and sequentially prompting a LLM to answer the question using each chunk. Adjusting the chunk size allows a trade-off between incorporating relevant information and reducing irrelevant information. Experimental results on three open-domain question answering datasets demonstrate that the adaptive strategy matches the performance of standard prompting while using fewer tokens. Our analysis reveals that when encountering insufficient information, the LLM often generates incorrect answers instead of declining to respond, which constitutes a major source of error. This finding highlights the need for further research into enhancing LLMs' ability to effectively decline requests when faced with inadequate information.

Motivation: 现有对抗攻击方法（如提示词或梯度攻击）存在局限性，研究旨在利用中间注意力层编码的token级假设的特性，生成与模型生成过程自洽的对抗扰动，以探索其在评估流程压力测试中的潜力。

Method: 从LLaMA-3.1-Instruct-8B中间注意力层提取token分布，直接生成对抗扰动，而非依赖外部提示词或梯度。实验使用ArgQuality数据集，以相同模型作为生成器和评估器，测试不同层数及位置的token替换效果。

Result: 注意力机制生成的对抗样本导致评估性能显著下降（如参数评价准确率降低），且保持与原输入的语义相似性；但特定层数及位置的token替换引发语法退化，削弱实际应用效果。

Conclusion: 中间层表征作为对抗样本源具有理论优势，可为LLM评估流程压力测试提供新路径，但受限于语法质量与扰动效果的平衡问题，需进一步优化层选择与位置定位策略。

Abstract: Recent advances in mechanistic interpretability suggest that intermediate attention layers encode token-level hypotheses that are iteratively refined toward the final output. In this work, we exploit this property to generate adversarial examples directly from attention-layer token distributions. Unlike prompt-based or gradient-based attacks, our approach leverages model-internal token predictions, producing perturbations that are both plausible and internally consistent with the model's own generation process. We evaluate whether tokens extracted from intermediate layers can serve as effective adversarial perturbations for downstream evaluation tasks. We conduct experiments on argument quality assessment using the ArgQuality dataset, with LLaMA-3.1-Instruct-8B serving as both the generator and evaluator. Our results show that attention-based adversarial examples lead to measurable drops in evaluation performance while remaining semantically similar to the original inputs. However, we also observe that substitutions drawn from certain layers and token positions can introduce grammatical degradation, limiting their practical effectiveness. Overall, our findings highlight both the promise and current limitations of using intermediate-layer representations as a principled source of adversarial examples for stress-testing LLM-based evaluation pipelines.

Abstract: This research project addresses the errors of financial numerical reasoning Question Answering (QA) tasks due to the lack of domain knowledge in finance. Despite recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), financial numerical questions remain challenging because they require specific domain knowledge in finance and complex multi-step numeric reasoning. We implement a multi-retriever Retrieval Augmented Generators (RAG) system to retrieve both external domain knowledge and internal question contexts, and utilize the latest LLM to tackle these tasks. Through comprehensive ablation experiments and error analysis, we find that domain-specific training with the SecBERT encoder significantly contributes to our best neural symbolic model surpassing the FinQA paper's top model, which serves as our baseline. This suggests the potential superior performance of domain-specific training. Furthermore, our best prompt-based LLM generator achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with significant improvement (>7%), yet it is still below the human expert performance. This study highlights the trade-off between hallucinations loss and external knowledge gains in smaller models and few-shot examples. For larger models, the gains from external facts typically outweigh the hallucination loss. Finally, our findings confirm the enhanced numerical reasoning capabilities of the latest LLM, optimized for few-shot learning.

Abstract: Open-ended responses are central to learning, yet automated scoring often conflates what students wrote with how teachers grade. We present an analytics-first framework that separates content signals from rater tendencies, making judgments visible and auditable via analytics. Using de-identified ASSISTments mathematics responses, we model teacher histories as dynamic priors and derive text representations from sentence embeddings, incorporating centering and residualization to mitigate prompt and teacher confounds. Temporally-validated linear models quantify the contributions of each signal, and a projection surfaces model disagreements for qualitative inspection. Results show that teacher priors heavily influence grade predictions; the strongest results arise when priors are combined with content embeddings (AUC~0.815), while content-only models remain above chance but substantially weaker (AUC~0.626). Adjusting for rater effects sharpens the residual content representation, retaining more informative embedding dimensions and revealing cases where semantic evidence supports understanding as opposed to surface-level differences in how students respond. The contribution presents a practical pipeline that transforms embeddings from mere features into learning analytics for reflection, enabling teachers and researchers to examine where grading practices align (or conflict) with evidence of student reasoning and learning.

Conclusion: 动态构建的高阶记忆结构（HGMem）能有效提升RAG系统的复杂推理能力，为长序列任务提供更强的知识组织范式。

Abstract: Multi-step retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a widely adopted strategy for enhancing large language models (LLMs) on tasks that demand global comprehension and intensive reasoning. Many RAG systems incorporate a working memory module to consolidate retrieved information. However, existing memory designs function primarily as passive storage that accumulates isolated facts for the purpose of condensing the lengthy inputs and generating new sub-queries through deduction. This static nature overlooks the crucial high-order correlations among primitive facts, the compositions of which can often provide stronger guidance for subsequent steps. Therefore, their representational strength and impact on multi-step reasoning and knowledge evolution are limited, resulting in fragmented reasoning and weak global sense-making capacity in extended contexts. We introduce HGMem, a hypergraph-based memory mechanism that extends the concept of memory beyond simple storage into a dynamic, expressive structure for complex reasoning and global understanding. In our approach, memory is represented as a hypergraph whose hyperedges correspond to distinct memory units, enabling the progressive formation of higher-order interactions within memory. This mechanism connects facts and thoughts around the focal problem, evolving into an integrated and situated knowledge structure that provides strong propositions for deeper reasoning in subsequent steps. We evaluate HGMem on several challenging datasets designed for global sense-making. Extensive experiments and in-depth analyses show that our method consistently improves multi-step RAG and substantially outperforms strong baseline systems across diverse tasks.

We introduce CEC-Zero, a zero-supervision reinforcement learning framework that addresses this by enabling LLMs to correct their own mistakes. CEC-Zero synthesizes errorful inputs from clean text, computes cluster-consensus rewards via semantic similarity and candidate agreement, and optimizes the policy with PPO. It outperforms supervised baselines by 10--13 F$_1$ points and strong LLM fine-tunes by 5--8 points across 9 benchmarks, with theoretical guarantees of unbiased rewards and convergence. CEC-Zero establishes a label-free paradigm for robust, scalable CSC, unlocking LLM potential in noisy text pipelines.

Conclusion: 无监督潜在表示学习能有效解码并调控LLMs的复杂推理机制，为模型解释性和可控性优化提供新路径。

Abstract: Despite the growing reasoning capabilities of recent large language models (LLMs), their internal mechanisms during the reasoning process remain underexplored. Prior approaches often rely on human-defined concepts (e.g., overthinking, reflection) at the word level to analyze reasoning in a supervised manner. However, such methods are limited, as it is infeasible to capture the full spectrum of potential reasoning behaviors, many of which are difficult to define in token space. In this work, we propose an unsupervised framework (namely, RISE: Reasoning behavior Interpretability via Sparse auto-Encoder) for discovering reasoning vectors, which we define as directions in the activation space that encode distinct reasoning behaviors. By segmenting chain-of-thought traces into sentence-level 'steps' and training sparse auto-encoders (SAEs) on step-level activations, we uncover disentangled features corresponding to interpretable behaviors such as reflection and backtracking. Visualization and clustering analyses show that these behaviors occupy separable regions in the decoder column space. Moreover, targeted interventions on SAE-derived vectors can controllably amplify or suppress specific reasoning behaviors, altering inference trajectories without retraining. Beyond behavior-specific disentanglement, SAEs capture structural properties such as response length, revealing clusters of long versus short reasoning traces. More interestingly, SAEs enable the discovery of novel behaviors beyond human supervision. We demonstrate the ability to control response confidence by identifying confidence-related vectors in the SAE decoder space. These findings underscore the potential of unsupervised latent discovery for both interpreting and controllably steering reasoning in LLMs.

Conclusion: Lightweight models match/exceed baseline performance, offering practical deployment options for real-world misinformation detection under resource constraints.

Abstract: Distinguishing fake or untrue news from satire or humor poses a unique challenge due to their overlapping linguistic features and divergent intent. This study develops WISE (Web Information Satire and Fakeness Evaluation) framework which benchmarks eight lightweight transformer models alongside two baseline models on a balanced dataset of 20,000 samples from Fakeddit, annotated as either fake news or satire. Using stratified 5-fold cross-validation, we evaluate models across comprehensive metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, MCC, Brier score, and Expected Calibration Error. Our evaluation reveals that MiniLM, a lightweight model, achieves the highest accuracy (87.58%) among all models, while RoBERTa-base achieves the highest ROC-AUC (95.42%) and strong accuracy (87.36%). DistilBERT offers an excellent efficiency-accuracy trade-off with 86.28\% accuracy and 93.90\% ROC-AUC. Statistical tests confirm significant performance differences between models, with paired t-tests and McNemar tests providing rigorous comparisons. Our findings highlight that lightweight models can match or exceed baseline performance, offering actionable insights for deploying misinformation detection systems in real-world, resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), when guided by explicit textual plans, can perform reliable step-by-step reasoning during problem-solving. However, generating accurate and effective textual plans remains challenging due to LLM hallucinations and the high diversity of task-specific questions. To address this, we draw inspiration from human Implicit Cognition (IC), the subconscious process by which decisions are guided by compact, generalized patterns learned from past experiences without requiring explicit verbalization. We propose iCLP, a novel framework that enables LLMs to adaptively generate latent plans (LPs), which are compact encodings of effective reasoning instructions. iCLP first distills explicit plans from existing step-by-step reasoning trajectories. It then learns discrete representations of these plans via a vector-quantized autoencoder coupled with a codebook. Finally, by fine-tuning LLMs on paired latent plans and corresponding reasoning steps, the models learn to perform implicit planning during reasoning. Experimental results on mathematical reasoning and code generation tasks demonstrate that, with iCLP, LLMs can plan in latent space while reasoning in language space. This approach yields significant improvements in both accuracy and efficiency and, crucially, demonstrates strong cross-domain generalization while preserving the interpretability of chain-of-thought reasoning.

TL;DR: 引入复合可靠性评分（CRS）作为统一框架，整合校准度、鲁棒性和不确定性量化，解决现有LLMs评估碎片化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs在医疗、法律等关键领域使用但可靠性存疑，现有评估仅孤立解决单一问题，缺乏综合指标。

Method: 构建包含校准度、鲁棒性、不确定性量化的CRS框架，并对10个开源LLMs在5个QA数据集进行基线测试、扰动测试和校准方法实验。

Result: CRS提供模型排名稳定性，发现单一指标未能识别的失败模式，揭示可靠系统需平衡准确性、鲁棒性和校准不确定性。

Conclusion: CRS为LLMs可靠性评估提供可解释综合指标，优于传统孤立评估方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) like LLaMA, Mistral, and Gemma are increasingly used in decision-critical domains such as healthcare, law, and finance, yet their reliability remains uncertain. They often make overconfident errors, degrade under input shifts, and lack clear uncertainty estimates. Existing evaluations are fragmented, addressing only isolated aspects. We introduce the Composite Reliability Score (CRS), a unified framework that integrates calibration, robustness, and uncertainty quantification into a single interpretable metric. Through experiments on ten leading open-source LLMs across five QA datasets, we assess performance under baselines, perturbations, and calibration methods. CRS delivers stable model rankings, uncovers hidden failure modes missed by single metrics, and highlights that the most dependable systems balance accuracy, robustness, and calibrated uncertainty.

Abstract: In this report, we introduce our latest translation models, HY-MT1.5-1.8B and HY-MT1.5-7B, a new family of machine translation models developed through a holistic training framework tailored for high-performance translation. Our methodology orchestrates a multi-stage pipeline that integrates general and MT-oriented pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, on-policy distillation, and reinforcement learning. HY-MT1.5-1.8B, the 1.8B-parameter model demonstrates remarkable parameter efficiency, comprehensively outperforming significantly larger open-source baselines (e.g., Tower-Plus-72B, Qwen3-32B) and mainstream commercial APIs (e.g., Microsoft Translator, Doubao Translator) in standard Chinese-foreign and English-foreign tasks. It achieves approximately 90% of the performance of ultra-large proprietary models such as Gemini-3.0-Pro, while marginally trailing Gemini-3.0-Pro on WMT25 and Mandarin-minority language benchmarks, it maintains a substantial lead over other competing models. Furthermore, HY-MT1.5-7B establishes a new state-of-the-art for its size class, achieving 95% of Gemini-3.0-Pro's performance on Flores-200 and surpassing it on the challenging WMT25 and Mandarin-minority language test sets. Beyond standard translation, the HY-MT1.5 series supports advanced constraints, including terminology intervention, context-aware translation, and format preservation. Extensive empirical evaluations confirm that both models offer highly competitive, robust solutions for general and specialized translation tasks within their respective parameter scales.

Abstract: Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) generate text through an iterative denoising process. They have recently gained attention due to mask-parallel decoding and competitive performance with autoregressive large language models. However, effective mechanisms for inference-time control and steering in MDLMs remain largely unexplored. We present an activation-steering framework for MDLMs that computes layer-wise steering vectors from a single forward pass using contrastive examples, without simulating the denoising trajectory. These directions are applied at every reverse-diffusion step, yielding an efficient inference-time control mechanism. Experiments on LLaDA-8B-Instruct demonstrate reliable modulation of high-level attributes, with ablations examining the effects of steering across transformer sub-modules and token scope (prompt vs.\ response).

Abstract: World Models serve as tools for understanding the current state of the world and predicting its future dynamics, with broad application potential across numerous fields. As a key component of world knowledge, emotion significantly influences human decision-making. While existing Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown preliminary capability in capturing world knowledge, they primarily focus on modeling physical-world regularities and lack systematic exploration of emotional factors. In this paper, we first demonstrate the importance of emotion in understanding the world by showing that removing emotionally relevant information degrades reasoning performance. Inspired by theory of mind, we further propose a Large Emotional World Model (LEWM). Specifically, we construct the Emotion-Why-How (EWH) dataset, which integrates emotion into causal relationships and enables reasoning about why actions occur and how emotions drive future world states. Based on this dataset, LEWM explicitly models emotional states alongside visual observations and actions, allowing the world model to predict both future states and emotional transitions. Experimental results show that LEWM more accurately predicts emotion-driven social behaviors while maintaining comparable performance to general world models on basic tasks.

Conclusion: MedKGI 结合医学验证知识与结构化框架，有效解决LLMs在临床场景的三大局限，推动AI辅助诊断的实际应用。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant promise in clinical diagnosis. However, current models struggle to emulate the iterative, diagnostic hypothesis-driven reasoning of real clinical scenarios. Specifically, current LLMs suffer from three critical limitations: (1) generating hallucinated medical content due to weak grounding in verified knowledge, (2) asking redundant or inefficient questions rather than discriminative ones that hinder diagnostic progress, and (3) losing coherence over multi-turn dialogues, leading to contradictory or inconsistent conclusions. To address these challenges, we propose MedKGI, a diagnostic framework grounded in clinical practices. MedKGI integrates a medical knowledge graph (KG) to constrain reasoning to validated medical ontologies, selects questions based on information gain to maximize diagnostic efficiency, and adopts an OSCE-format structured state to maintain consistent evidence tracking across turns. Experiments on clinical benchmarks show that MedKGI outperforms strong LLM baselines in both diagnostic accuracy and inquiry efficiency, improving dialogue efficiency by 30% on average while maintaining state-of-the-art accuracy.

Motivation: 现有语言模型在专利与论文场景下可能存在适应性不足的问题，且需验证美国专利引用是否存在因‘诚信义务’导致的语义低相似性假设。

Method: 基于SPECTER2模型进行专利数据微调生成Pat-SPECTER，通过‘赛马式评估’对比八种模型预测可靠专利-论文引用的能力；在两组真实场景（分离专利-论文对和预测专利-论文对）中测试模型性能，并验证美国专利引用语义相似性差异的假设。

Abstract: We develop a language similarity model suitable for working with patents and scientific publications at the same time. In a horse race-style evaluation, we subject eight language (similarity) models to predict credible Patent-Paper Citations. We find that our Pat-SPECTER model performs best, which is the SPECTER2 model fine-tuned on patents. In two real-world scenarios (separating patent-paper-pairs and predicting patent-paper-pairs) we demonstrate the capabilities of the Pat-SPECTER. We finally test the hypothesis that US patents cite papers that are semantically less similar than in other large jurisdictions, which we posit is because of the duty of candor. The model is open for the academic community and practitioners alike.

### [116] [Joint Selection for Large-Scale Pre-Training Data via Policy Gradient-based Mask Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24265)
*Ziqing Fan,Yuqiao Xian,Yan Sun,Li Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DATAMASK is a framework for efficient pre-training data selection in large language models, combining quality and diversity metrics through policy gradient-based mask learning to improve training efficiency and model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods prioritize either quality or diversity in data selection, leading to diminishing returns or loss of high-quality samples. Combining these metrics jointly remains challenging due to high computational costs in trillion-scale datasets like FineWeb and DCLM.

Method: DATAMASK reformulates data selection as a mask learning problem. It iteratively samples data masks, computes policy gradients based on predefined objectives (quality and diversity), and updates mask sampling logits. Acceleration techniques reduce computational overhead by 98.9% compared to greedy algorithms.

Result: DATAMASK achieved a 98.9% reduction in selection time and selected a 10% subset (FineWeb-Mask) from 15 trillion tokens. Evaluations on 12 tasks showed 3.2% improvement for a 1.5B dense model and 1.9% for a 7B MoE model.

Conclusion: DATAMASK enables joint optimization of quality and diversity metrics in trillion-scale pre-training, significantly enhancing efficiency and model performance while addressing computational bottlenecks.

Abstract: A fine-grained data recipe is crucial for pre-training large language models, as it can significantly enhance training efficiency and model performance. One important ingredient in the recipe is to select samples based on scores produced by defined rules, LLM judgment, or statistical information in embeddings, which can be roughly categorized into quality and diversity metrics. Due to the high computational cost when applied to trillion-scale token pre-training datasets such as FineWeb and DCLM, these two or more types of metrics are rarely considered jointly in a single selection process. However, in our empirical study, selecting samples based on quality metrics exhibit severe diminishing returns during long-term pre-training, while selecting on diversity metrics removes too many valuable high-quality samples, both of which limit pre-trained LLMs' capabilities. Therefore, we introduce DATAMASK, a novel and efficient joint learning framework designed for large-scale pre-training data selection that can simultaneously optimize multiple types of metrics in a unified process, with this study focusing specifically on quality and diversity metrics. DATAMASK approaches the selection process as a mask learning problem, involving iterative sampling of data masks, computation of policy gradients based on predefined objectives with sampled masks, and updating of mask sampling logits. Through policy gradient-based optimization and various acceleration enhancements, it significantly reduces selection time by 98.9% compared to greedy algorithm, enabling our study to explore joint learning within trillion-scale tokens. With DATAMASK, we select a subset of about 10% from the 15 trillion-token FineWeb dataset, termed FineWeb-Mask. Evaluated across 12 diverse tasks, we achieves significant improvements of 3.2% on a 1.5B dense model and 1.9% on a 7B MoE model.

Motivation: 欧盟分类法规的合规流程手动且资源密集，LLMs虽有望实现自动化，但受限于缺乏公开的基准数据集。本研究旨在填补这一空白，并系统评估LLMs在核心合规任务中的表现。

Method: 从190份企业报告中构建包含经济活动和关键绩效指标（KPI）的结构化数据集，通过定性（识别经济活动）与定量任务（预测KPI）评估LLMs性能，并测试多步骤框架、元数据与完整报告的效果差异。

Result: LLMs在定性任务中表现中等，多步骤框架小幅提升精确度；定量任务在零样本设置下全面失败。发现简洁的元数据常优于完整报告，且模型置信度校准不佳。

Conclusion: LLMs尚未具备完全自动化能力，但可作为专家辅助工具。研究提供的公开数据集为未来研究提供了基准。

Abstract: The manual, resource-intensive process of complying with the EU Taxonomy presents a significant challenge for companies. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a path to automation, research is hindered by a lack of public benchmark datasets. To address this gap, we introduce a novel, structured dataset from 190 corporate reports, containing ground-truth economic activities and quantitative Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). We use this dataset to conduct the first systematic evaluation of LLMs on the core compliance workflow. Our results reveal a clear performance gap between qualitative and quantitative tasks. LLMs show moderate success in the qualitative task of identifying economic activities, with a multi-step agentic framework modestly enhancing precision. Conversely, the models comprehensively fail at the quantitative task of predicting financial KPIs in a zero-shot setting. We also discover a paradox, where concise metadata often yields superior performance to full, unstructured reports, and find that model confidence scores are poorly calibrated. We conclude that while LLMs are not ready for full automation, they can serve as powerful assistive tools for human experts. Our dataset provides a public benchmark for future research.

Conclusion: 视觉引导的FIGR框架显著提升复杂推理的稳定性与可靠性，突破纯文本模型局限。

Abstract: Complex reasoning problems often involve implicit spatial, geometric, and structural relationships that are not explicitly encoded in text. While recent reasoning models have achieved strong performance across many domains, purely text-based reasoning struggles to represent global structural constraints in complex settings. In this paper, we introduce FIGR, which integrates active visual thinking into multi-turn reasoning via end-to-end reinforcement learning. FIGR externalizes intermediate structural hypotheses by constructing visual representations during problem solving. By adaptively regulating when and how visual reasoning should be invoked, FIGR enables more stable and coherent reasoning over global structural properties that are difficult to capture from text alone. Experiments on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that FIGR outperforms strong text-only chain-of-thought baselines. In particular, FIGR improves the base model by 13.12% on AIME 2025 and 11.00% on BeyondAIME, highlighting the effectiveness of figure-guided multimodal reasoning in enhancing the stability and reliability of complex reasoning.

### [119] [World model inspired sarcasm reasoning with large language model agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24329)
*Keito Inoshita,Shinnosuke Mizuno*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes WM-SAR, a world model-inspired sarcasm detection framework using specialized LLM agents and logistic regression to decompose and quantify semantic incongruity, intention, and normative expectations, achieving superior performance with explainable numerical reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of interpretability in existing sarcasm detection models by explicitly modeling the cognitive processes of semantic incongruity and intention reasoning, which are crucial for human sarcasm comprehension but remain underexplored in current approaches.

Method: Decompose sarcasm detection into four components using specialized LLM-based agents: (1) literal meaning extraction, (2) context analysis, (3) normative expectation modeling, and (4) intention detection. Calculate semantic inconsistency score (literal vs expectation) and intention score, then input these numerical signals into a logistic regression model for sarcasm probability estimation.

Result: WM-SAR outperforms existing deep learning and LLM-based methods on sarcasm detection benchmarks while maintaining explicit interpretability through its numerical reasoning pipeline. Ablation studies verify the necessity of both semantic inconsistency and intention reasoning components.

Conclusion: Explicit decomposition of sarcasm's cognitive dimensions combined with numerical reasoning improves both detection performance and model transparency, offering a paradigm for developing interpretable LLM-based systems that mirror human reasoning processes.

Abstract: Sarcasm understanding is a challenging problem in natural language processing, as it requires capturing the discrepancy between the surface meaning of an utterance and the speaker's intentions as well as the surrounding social context. Although recent advances in deep learning and Large Language Models (LLMs) have substantially improved performance, most existing approaches still rely on black-box predictions of a single model, making it difficult to structurally explain the cognitive factors underlying sarcasm. Moreover, while sarcasm often emerges as a mismatch between semantic evaluation and normative expectations or intentions, frameworks that explicitly decompose and model these components remain limited. In this work, we reformulate sarcasm understanding as a world model inspired reasoning process and propose World Model inspired SArcasm Reasoning (WM-SAR), which decomposes literal meaning, context, normative expectation, and intention into specialized LLM-based agents. The discrepancy between literal evaluation and normative expectation is explicitly quantified as a deterministic inconsistency score, and together with an intention score, these signals are integrated by a lightweight Logistic Regression model to infer the final sarcasm probability. This design leverages the reasoning capability of LLMs while maintaining an interpretable numerical decision structure. Experiments on representative sarcasm detection benchmarks show that WM-SAR consistently outperforms existing deep learning and LLM-based methods. Ablation studies and case analyses further demonstrate that integrating semantic inconsistency and intention reasoning is essential for effective sarcasm detection, achieving both strong performance and high interpretability.

Conclusion: 仿生策略有效解决长文档表征难题，通过逻辑推理引导的对比学习平衡效率与效果，为专业领域文档分析提供通用解决方案。

Abstract: Although transformer-based models have shown strong performance in word- and sentence-level tasks, effectively representing long documents, especially in fields like law and medicine, remains difficult. Sparse attention mechanisms can handle longer inputs, but are resource-intensive and often fail to capture full-document context. Hierarchical transformer models offer better efficiency but do not clearly explain how they relate different sections of a document. In contrast, humans often skim texts, focusing on important sections to understand the overall message. Drawing from this human strategy, we introduce a new self-supervised contrastive learning framework that enhances long document representation. Our method randomly masks a section of the document and uses a natural language inference (NLI)-based contrastive objective to align it with relevant parts while distancing it from unrelated ones. This mimics how humans synthesize information, resulting in representations that are both richer and more computationally efficient. Experiments on legal and biomedical texts confirm significant gains in both accuracy and efficiency.

*Chester Palen-Michel,Constantine Lignos*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本论文比较了不同低资源语言摘要方法，发现多语言微调的mT5模型优于零样本大语言模型和翻译流程方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高资源语言（如英语）的摘要技术已较成熟，但低资源语言的摘要研究仍缺乏系统比较和有效方法。

Method: 对比零样本提示（LLMs）、mT5微调（包括数据增强和跨语言迁移），以及大模型翻译流水线（源语言→英语→摘要→源语言回译）方法。

Result: 多语言微调mT5基线在多数指标上优于其他方法；相同参数规模LLM表现差异显著；LLM作为低资源语言评估工具可靠性不足。

Conclusion: 针对低资源语言，微调小型多语言模型更稳定有效，且需谨慎依赖大模型翻译流水线和LLM评估结果。

Abstract: Automatic text summarization has achieved high performance in high-resourced languages like English, but comparatively less attention has been given to summarization in less-resourced languages. This work compares a variety of different approaches to summarization from zero-shot prompting of LLMs large and small to fine-tuning smaller models like mT5 with and without three data augmentation approaches and multilingual transfer. We also explore an LLM translation pipeline approach, translating from the source language to English, summarizing and translating back. Evaluating with five different metrics, we find that there is variation across LLMs in their performance across similar parameter sizes, that our multilingual fine-tuned mT5 baseline outperforms most other approaches including zero-shot LLM performance for most metrics, and that LLM as judge may be less reliable on less-resourced languages.

*Michael E. Rose,Nils A. Herrmann,Sebastian Erhardt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个开源的语言模型，用于清理英文学术摘要中的多余信息，提升文本分析准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学术摘要常含版权说明、作者信息等杂乱内容，可能影响文档相似性分析和文本嵌入，需要有效清理方法。

Method: 构建基于语言模型的自动化清理工具，通过识别并移除非内容元素，结合标准文本处理技术实现摘要净化。

Result: 实验证明模型具有保守性和精确性，能修正相似度排名并增强标准长度嵌入的信息量。

Conclusion: 该模型可提升学术摘要分析质量，且开源工具适用于大规模数据预处理场景。

Abstract: Scientific abstracts are often used as proxies for the content and thematic focus of research publications. However, a significant share of published abstracts contains extraneous information-such as publisher copyright statements, section headings, author notes, registrations, and bibliometric or bibliographic metadata-that can distort downstream analyses, particularly those involving document similarity or textual embeddings. We introduce an open-source, easy-to-integrate language model designed to clean English-language scientific abstracts by automatically identifying and removing such clutter. We demonstrate that our model is both conservative and precise, alters similarity rankings of cleaned abstracts and improves information content of standard-length embeddings.

### [123] [IELTS Writing Revision Platform with Automated Essay Scoring and Adaptive Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24460)
*Titas Ramancauskas,Kotryna Ramancauske*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本论文开发了一个雅思写作备考平台，结合自动化评分与个性化反馈。通过设计迭代验证，基于DistilBERT的评分系统显著提升效果，但自适应反馈在结构修改上效果受限，建议结合人工指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统雅思写作备考方法缺乏对评分标准的针对性反馈，且人工评估成本高，用户急需高效个性化辅助工具。

Method: 采用基于设计的研究方法（DBR）迭代开发平台：1) 分离写作界面与指导模块；2) 从规则模型升级为DistilBERT回归头评分模型；3) 实现基于评分结果的自适应反馈机制。

Result: DistilBERT模型实现MAE 0.66且正向R²值，自适应反馈使分数平均提升0.060个band（p=0.011，Cohen's d=0.504），但结构修改反馈效果波动较大。

Conclusion: 自动化反馈适合作为辅助工具，表面修改比深层结构优化更可靠。需进一步通过真实考生验证有效性，并解决高难度作文的评估难题。

Abstract: This paper presents the design, development, and evaluation of a proposed revision platform assisting candidates for the International English Language Testing System (IELTS) writing exam. Traditional IELTS preparation methods lack personalised feedback, catered to the IELTS writing rubric. To address these shortcomings, the platform features an attractive user interface (UI), an Automated Essay Scoring system (AES), and targeted feedback tailored to candidates and the IELTS writing rubric. The platform architecture separates conversational guidance from a dedicated writing interface to reduce cognitive load and simulate exam conditions. Through iterative, Design-Based Research (DBR) cycles, the study progressed from rule-based to transformer-based with a regression head scoring, mounted with adaptive feedback.
  Early cycles (2-3) revealed fundamental limitations of rule-based approaches: mid-band compression, low accuracy, and negative $R^2$ values. DBR Cycle 4 implemented a DistilBERT transformer model with a regression head, yielding substantial improvements with MAE of 0.66 and positive $R^2$. This enabled Cycle 5's adaptive feedback implementation, which demonstrated statistically significant score improvements (mean +0.060 bands, p = 0.011, Cohen's d = 0.504), though effectiveness varied by revision strategy. Findings suggest automated feedback functions are most suited as a supplement to human instruction, with conservative surface-level corrections proving more reliable than aggressive structural interventions for IELTS preparation contexts. Challenges remain in assessing higher-band essays, and future work should incorporate longitudinal studies with real IELTS candidates and validation from official examiners.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出TEDPara和YTSegPara两个新基准数据集，并通过约束解码和MiniSeg模型解决语音转录文本的段落分割问题，确立段落分割为语音处理标准化任务


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音转录文本缺乏结构化处理阻碍可读性和再利用，现有文本分割领域缺少自然化基准，段落分割未被纳入语音后处理流程

Method: 构建TEDPara（人工标注TED演讲）和YTSegPara（合成标签YouTube视频）基准；开发约束解码技术使语言模型无损插入段落符；设计层次化MiniSeg模型同步预测章节和段落

Result: 建立首个语音段落分割基准体系，MiniSeg模型实现SOTA准确率且计算成本低，约束解码支持精准的句子级对齐评估

Conclusion: 成功将段落分割确立为语音处理标准化任务，为文本分割领域提供高质量基准数据与高效模型范式，推动结构化语音转录应用发展

Abstract: Automatic speech transcripts are often delivered as unstructured word streams that impede readability and repurposing. We recast paragraph segmentation as the missing structuring step and fill three gaps at the intersection of speech processing and text segmentation. First, we establish TEDPara (human-annotated TED talks) and YTSegPara (YouTube videos with synthetic labels) as the first benchmarks for the paragraph segmentation task. The benchmarks focus on the underexplored speech domain, where paragraph segmentation has traditionally not been part of post-processing, while also contributing to the wider text segmentation field, which still lacks robust and naturalistic benchmarks. Second, we propose a constrained-decoding formulation that lets large language models insert paragraph breaks while preserving the original transcript, enabling faithful, sentence-aligned evaluation. Third, we show that a compact model (MiniSeg) attains state-of-the-art accuracy and, when extended hierarchically, jointly predicts chapters and paragraphs with minimal computational cost. Together, our resources and methods establish paragraph segmentation as a standardized, practical task in speech processing.

*Muhammad Abdullahi Said,Muhammad Sammani Sani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大规模语言模型（LLMs）的安全对齐在跨语言（尤其是英语到豪萨语）及时间框架中的表现存在显著不稳定性，揭示了‘复杂干扰’和‘时间不对称’现象，挑战了当前多语言安全差距的主流观点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs应用于全球关键基础设施，跨语言安全对齐的零样本迁移假设存在风险，且现有研究未充分探索语言与语境变量（如时间框架）的交互作用。

Method: 构建了基于西非威胁场景（如Yahoo-Yahoo诈骗）的对抗数据集HausaSafety，对GPT-5.1、Gemini 3 Pro和Claude 4.5 Opus三类模型进行2x4因子实验设计，涵盖1440次评估，分析语言（英语vs豪萨语）与时间框架（过去/未来）的交互效应。

Result: 发现‘复杂干扰机制’：Claude 4.5 Opus在豪萨语中因不确定性拒绝策略反而更安全（45.0% vs 36.7%），但出现时间推理灾难性失效；‘时间不对称’显著——过去式攻击防御成功率仅15.6%，未来式达57.2%，最高安全配置差距达9.2倍。

Conclusion: 现有LLMs依赖表层启发式策略导致‘安全孤岛’现象，提出‘不变对齐’范式转变以实现跨语言和时间框架的安全稳定性。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) integrate into critical global infrastructure, the assumption that safety alignment transfers zero-shot from English to other languages remains a dangerous blind spot. This study presents a systematic audit of three state of the art models (GPT-5.1, Gemini 3 Pro, and Claude 4.5 Opus) using HausaSafety, a novel adversarial dataset grounded in West African threat scenarios (e.g., Yahoo-Yahoo fraud, Dane gun manufacturing). Employing a 2 x 4 factorial design across 1,440 evaluations, we tested the non-linear interaction between language (English vs. Hausa) and temporal framing. Our results challenge the prevailing multilingual safety gap narrative. Instead of a simple degradation in low-resource settings, we identified a mechanism of Complex Interference where safety is determined by the intersection of variables. While models exhibited a Reverse Linguistic with Claude 4.5 Opus proving significantly safer in Hausa (45.0%) than in English (36.7%) due to uncertainty-driven refusal they suffered catastrophic failures in temporal reasoning. We report a profound Temporal Asymmetry, where past-tense framing bypassed defenses (15.6% safe) while future-tense scenarios triggered hyper-conservative refusals (57.2% safe). The magnitude of this volatility is illustrated by a 9.2x disparity between the safest and most vulnerable configurations, proving that safety is not a fixed property but a context-dependent state. We conclude that current models rely on superficial heuristics rather than robust semantic understanding, creating Safety Pockets that leave Global South users exposed to localized harms. We propose Invariant Alignment as a necessary paradigm shift to ensure safety stability across linguistic and temporal shifts.

### [126] [HaluNet: Multi-Granular Uncertainty Modeling for Efficient Hallucination Detection in LLM Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24562)
*Chaodong Tong,Qi Zhang,Jiayang Gao,Lei Jiang,Yanbing Liu,Nannan Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在问答任务中表现出色但易产生幻觉，本文提出了一种轻量级可训练框架HaluNet，通过整合多粒度token级不确定性（概率置信度与语义表示），实现了高效的单次幻觉检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检测LLM幻觉的方法仅关注单一不确定性来源（如token级概率不确定性），忽略了不同不确定性源（如语义表示的不确定性）之间的互补性，需要一种无需外部资源、可扩展且计算高效的检测方法。

Method: HaluNet设计多分支架构，融合模型的语义嵌入与概率置信度、分布不确定性，通过自适应机制结合模型知识与输出不确定性，实现单次前向传播的端到端检测。

Result: 在SQuAD、TriviaQA和Natural Questions数据集上，HaluNet在有/无上下文条件下均表现出色，计算效率优于现有方法，支持实时检测需求。

Conclusion: HaluNet通过整合多源内在不确定性，为LLM问答系统的实时幻觉检测提供了实用且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at question answering (QA) but often generate hallucinations, including factual errors or fabricated content. Detecting hallucinations from internal uncertainty signals is attractive due to its scalability and independence from external resources. Existing methods often aim to accurately capture a single type of uncertainty while overlooking the complementarity among different sources, particularly between token-level probability uncertainty and the uncertainty conveyed by internal semantic representations, which provide complementary views on model reliability. We present \textbf{HaluNet}, a lightweight and trainable neural framework that integrates multi granular token level uncertainties by combining semantic embeddings with probabilistic confidence and distributional uncertainty. Its multi branch architecture adaptively fuses what the model knows with the uncertainty expressed in its outputs, enabling efficient one pass hallucination detection. Experiments on SQuAD, TriviaQA, and Natural Questions show that HaluNet delivers strong detection performance and favorable computational efficiency, with or without access to context, highlighting its potential for real time hallucination detection in LLM based QA systems.

Conclusion: 开源所有资源推动法律AI领域发展，突显提升模型推理功能的重要性

Abstract: We introduce the Korean Canonical Legal Benchmark (KCL), a benchmark designed to assess language models' legal reasoning capabilities independently of domain-specific knowledge. KCL provides question-level supporting precedents, enabling a more faithful disentanglement of reasoning ability from parameterized knowledge. KCL consists of two components: (1) KCL-MCQA, multiple-choice problems of 283 questions with 1,103 aligned precedents, and (2) KCL-Essay, open-ended generation problems of 169 questions with 550 aligned precedents and 2,739 instance-level rubrics for automated evaluation. Our systematic evaluation of 30+ models shows large remaining gaps, particularly in KCL-Essay, and that reasoning-specialized models consistently outperform their general-purpose counterparts. We release all resources, including the benchmark dataset and evaluation code, at https://github.com/lbox-kr/kcl.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes CREST, a training-free method for improving large language model (LLM) reasoning efficiency by steering towards productive reasoning trajectories through attention head modulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in LLMs causes high latency from excessive token generation and unstable reasoning patterns (underthinking/overthinking), necessitating an intervention to enhance reasoning quality and computational efficiency.

Method: Discovered correlation between specialized attention heads and cognitive behaviors (verification/backtracking). Created CREST with: (1) offline calibration identifying cognitive heads and deriving steering vectors, and (2) inference-time suppression of unproductive reasoning components through hidden state rotation.

Result: CREST improves reasoning accuracy by up to 17.5% while reducing token usage by 37.6% across multiple LLMs and benchmarks.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that adaptive suppression of inefficient reasoning patterns via attention head manipulation offers a practical pathway to faster, more reliable LLM inference without retraining.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often rely on long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to solve complex tasks. While effective, these trajectories are frequently inefficient, leading to high latency from excessive token generation, or unstable reasoning that alternates between underthinking (shallow, inconsistent steps) and overthinking (repetitive, verbose reasoning). In this work, we study the structure of reasoning trajectories and uncover specialized attention heads that correlate with distinct cognitive behaviors such as verification and backtracking. By lightly intervening on these heads at inference time, we can steer the model away from inefficient modes. Building on this insight, we propose CREST, a training-free method for Cognitive REasoning Steering at Test-time. CREST has two components: (1) an offline calibration step that identifies cognitive heads and derives head-specific steering vectors, and (2) an inference-time procedure that rotates hidden representations to suppress components along those vectors. CREST adaptively suppresses unproductive reasoning behaviors, yielding both higher accuracy and lower computational cost. Across diverse reasoning benchmarks and models, CREST improves accuracy by up to 17.5% while reducing token usage by 37.6%, offering a simple and effective pathway to faster, more reliable LLM reasoning.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大语言模型预测自身表现能力及决策改进，发现其存在过度自信，但有一定预测能力，部分模型可通过失败经验优化决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为提升LLMs在多步骤和高成本风险决策中的可靠性，需评估其自我预测准确性及动态学习潜力。

Method: 测试不同LLMs在单步/多步任务中预测准确度及自信度变化，引入失败经验观察决策调整，并比较推理与非推理模型表现。

Result: 所有模型过度自信但预测优于随机；Claude模型随规模提升区分能力；多步任务自信度恶化；部分模型通过失败经验降低过度自信并改进决策；决策逻辑与概率估计一致但受过度乐观影响。

Conclusion: LLMs因缺乏自知之明导致决策缺陷，虽决策基于自身概率评估符合逻辑，但过度自信引发风险。研究强调需增强模型元认知能力以减少滥用风险。

Abstract: We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can predict whether they will succeed on a given task and whether their predictions improve as they progress through multi-step tasks. We also investigate whether LLMs can learn from in-context experiences to make better decisions about whether to pursue a task in scenarios where failure is costly. All LLMs we tested are overconfident, but most predict their success with better-than-random discriminatory power. We find that newer and larger LLMs generally do not have greater discriminatory power, though Claude models do show such a trend. On multi-step agentic tasks, the overconfidence of several frontier LLMs worsens as they progress through the tasks, and reasoning LLMs perform comparably to or worse than non-reasoning LLMs. With in-context experiences of failure, some but not all LLMs reduce their overconfidence leading to significantly improved decision making, while others do not. Interestingly, all LLMs' decisions are approximately rational given their estimated probabilities of success, yet their overly-optimistic estimates result in poor decision making. These results suggest that current LLM agents are hindered by their lack of awareness of their own capabilities. We discuss the implications of LLMs' awareness of their capabilities for AI misuse and misalignment risks.

### [130] [MUSIC: MUlti-Step Instruction Contrast for Multi-Turn Reward Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24693)
*Wenzhe Li,Shujian Zhang,Wenxuan Zhou,John Lambert,Chi Jin,Andrew Hard,Rajiv Mathews,Lun Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces MUSIC, an unsupervised data augmentation strategy, to enhance multi-turn reward models (RMs) for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs), improving alignment with LLM judges while maintaining single-turn performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional preference datasets focus on final conversational turns, failing to capture multi-turn interaction nuances. This limits the effectiveness of current multi-turn reward models in automated LLM evaluation.

Method: The authors propose MUSIC, an unsupervised data augmentation technique that generates contrastive conversation pairs with multi-turn differences. They train a multi-turn RM on the augmented Skywork dataset using Gemma-2-9B-Instruct.

Result: MUSIC-augmented RMs outperformed baseline methods by achieving stronger alignment with advanced LLM judges in multi-turn scenarios, while maintaining performance on standard single-turn RM benchmarks.

Conclusion: Multi-turn evaluation requires contrasts spanning multiple conversation steps, and MUSIC effectively enables training robust reward models that enhance LLM evaluation capabilities without compromising single-turn effectiveness.

Abstract: Evaluating the quality of multi-turn conversations is crucial for developing capable Large Language Models (LLMs), yet remains a significant challenge, often requiring costly human evaluation. Multi-turn reward models (RMs) offer a scalable alternative and can provide valuable signals for guiding LLM training. While recent work has advanced multi-turn \textit{training} techniques, effective automated \textit{evaluation} specifically for multi-turn interactions lags behind. We observe that standard preference datasets, typically contrasting responses based only on the final conversational turn, provide insufficient signal to capture the nuances of multi-turn interactions. Instead, we find that incorporating contrasts spanning \textit{multiple} turns is critical for building robust multi-turn RMs. Motivated by this finding, we propose \textbf{MU}lti-\textbf{S}tep \textbf{I}nstruction \textbf{C}ontrast (MUSIC), an unsupervised data augmentation strategy that synthesizes contrastive conversation pairs exhibiting differences across multiple turns. Leveraging MUSIC on the Skywork preference dataset, we train a multi-turn RM based on the Gemma-2-9B-Instruct model. Empirical results demonstrate that our MUSIC-augmented RM outperforms baseline methods, achieving higher alignment with judgments from advanced proprietary LLM judges on multi-turn conversations, crucially, without compromising performance on standard single-turn RM benchmarks.

*Sibo Wei,Peng Chen,Lifeng Dong,Yin Luo,Lei Wang,Peng Zhang,Wenpeng Lu,Jianbin Guo,Hongjun Yang,Dajun Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Multi-omics pathway analysis is hindered by limitations in traditional pathway enrichment methods, prompting the development of BIOME-Bench to evaluate LLMs' capabilities in biomolecular interaction inference and pathway mechanism elucidation, revealing current model deficiencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional pathway enrichment methods face curation lag, redundancy, and limited sensitivity, while LLM applications lack standardized benchmarks for end-to-end evaluation, resulting in fragmented and non-reproducible results.

Method: Proposed BIOME-Bench, a benchmark with a four-stage workflow, to assess two core LLM capabilities: (1) biomolecular interaction inference and (2) multi-omics pathway mechanism explanation. Evaluation protocols were developed and tested across contemporary LLMs.

Result: Current LLMs exhibit significant limitations in distinguishing fine-grained biomolecular relations and generating accurate, robust pathway-level explanations in multi-omics analysis.

Conclusion: BIOME-Bench addresses critical evaluation gaps, highlighting that existing LLMs remain inadequate for reliable multi-omics pathway interpretation and requiring further methodological advancements.

Abstract: Multi-omics studies often rely on pathway enrichment to interpret heterogeneous molecular changes, but pathway enrichment (PE)-based workflows inherit structural limitations of pathway resources, including curation lag, functional redundancy, and limited sensitivity to molecular states and interventions. Although recent work has explored using large language models (LLMs) to improve PE-based interpretation, the lack of a standardized benchmark for end-to-end multi-omics pathway mechanism elucidation has largely confined evaluation to small, manually curated datasets or ad hoc case studies, hindering reproducible progress. To address this issue, we introduce BIOME-Bench, constructed via a rigorous four-stage workflow, to evaluate two core capabilities of LLMs in multi-omics analysis: Biomolecular Interaction Inference and end-to-end Multi-Omics Pathway Mechanism Elucidation. We develop evaluation protocols for both tasks and conduct comprehensive experiments across multiple strong contemporary models. Experimental results demonstrate that existing models still exhibit substantial deficiencies in multi-omics analysis, struggling to reliably distinguish fine-grained biomolecular relation types and to generate faithful, robust pathway-level mechanistic explanations.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了如何在大规模语言模型（LLMs）的复杂推理能力与计算成本之间取得平衡，提出Mixture of Experts（MoE）架构能有效结合性能与效率，并指出推理计算存在饱和点，超出后准确率提升有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究过于关注LLMs的推理性能，忽视了生成长推理链的计算负担。工业应用中需同时权衡准确率、资源约束和推理成本，亟需针对模型选择的计算效率评估方法。

Method: 对新旧开源LLMs进行测试时计算感知评估，在数学和推理密集型基准中绘制帕累托前沿（Pareto frontiers），并追踪时间维度的效率变化趋势。

Result: 1) MoE架构在平衡性能与效率中表现突出；2) 发现帕累托效率随时间呈现特定趋势；3) 推理计算存在饱和阈值，超过后准确率增益显著下降。

Conclusion: MoE是兼顾复杂推理与效率的优选方案，但模型性能提升受计算饱和现象限制，揭示了扩展推理能力无法弥补模型本身的复杂度局限。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are demonstrating rapid improvements on complex reasoning benchmarks, particularly when allowed to utilize intermediate reasoning steps before converging on a final solution. However, current literature often overlooks the significant computational burden associated with generating long reasoning sequences. For industrial applications, model selection depends not only on raw accuracy but also on resource constraints and inference costs. In this work, we conduct a test-time-compute aware evaluation of both contemporary and older open-source LLMs, mapping their Pareto frontiers across math- and reasoning-intensive benchmarks. Our findings identify the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture as a strong candidate to balance performance and efficiency in our evaluation setting. Furthermore, we trace the trajectory of Pareto efficiency over time to derive an emergent trend regarding accuracy gain per unit of compute. Finally, we demonstrate that there is a saturation point for inference-time compute. Beyond a certain threshold, accuracy gains diminish, indicating that while extended reasoning capabilities are beneficial, they cannot overcome intrinsic model limitations regarding specific complexities.

Abstract: As Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems become more pervasive, integrating ethical considerations into NLP education has become essential. However, this presents inherent challenges in curriculum development: the field's rapid evolution from both academia and industry, and the need to foster critical thinking beyond traditional technical training. We introduce our course on Ethical Aspects in NLP and our pedagogical approach, grounded in active learning through interactive sessions, hands-on activities, and "learning by teaching" methods. Over four years, the course has been refined and adapted across different institutions, educational levels, and interdisciplinary backgrounds; it has also yielded many reusable products, both in the form of teaching materials and in the form of actual educational products aimed at diverse audiences, made by the students themselves. By sharing our approach and experience, we hope to provide inspiration for educators seeking to incorporate social impact considerations into their curricula.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言模型在不同语言和文化中的行为不稳定，现有机制分析缺乏因果标准，需通过跨环境验证保证解释的可靠性。

Method: 定义参考集合（保持谓词的变体），提出三维度验证：必要性（消融影响行为）、充分性（激活移植验证）、不变性（跨语言稳定性）。结合自动电路发现与因果抽象理论，设计跨模型族和语言对的实验协议。

Result: 三角验证能过滤单环境有效但跨语言失效的虚假电路，提供可证伪的机制分析标准。

Conclusion: 该方法强调跨语言不变性，为多语言模型的可解释性提供因果基准。

Abstract: Multilingual language models achieve strong aggregate performance yet often behave unpredictably across languages, scripts, and cultures. We argue that mechanistic explanations for such models should satisfy a \emph{causal} standard: claims must survive causal interventions and must \emph{cross-reference} across environments that perturb surface form while preserving meaning. We formalize \emph{reference families} as predicate-preserving variants and introduce \emph{triangulation}, an acceptance rule requiring necessity (ablating the circuit degrades the target behavior), sufficiency (patching activations transfers the behavior), and invariance (both effects remain directionally stable and of sufficient magnitude across the reference family). To supply candidate subgraphs, we adopt automatic circuit discovery and \emph{accept or reject} those candidates by triangulation. We ground triangulation in causal abstraction by casting it as an approximate transformation score over a distribution of interchange interventions, connect it to the pragmatic interpretability agenda, and present a comparative experimental protocol across multiple model families, language pairs, and tasks. Triangulation provides a falsifiable standard for mechanistic claims that filters spurious circuits passing single-environment tests but failing cross-lingual invariance.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于知识陈述语句的新型评估基准Encyclo-K，通过动态生成多知识点整合型问题来解决现有基准易受数据污染、单知识点评估限制和专家标注成本高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估基准存在三大缺陷：数据污染易发性（模型可能记住训练数据）、单知识点评估局限性（难以测试综合能力）和专家标注依赖性（成本高昂）。研究旨在构建可扩展、动态更新且标注效率更高的评估框架。

Method: 从权威教材提取独立知识陈述语句单元，测试时通过随机采样语句组合生成问题。采用三级过滤机制确保语句质量，仅需验证格式而非内容的专业性标注。设计组合逻辑实现多语句关联的问题构建，并通过动态生成不同测试集验证评估稳定性。

Result: 在50余个大模型上进行测试，显示GPT-5.1准确率62.07%，推理模型得分区间为16.04%-62.07%，对话模型为9.71%-50.40%。证明动态评估和多语句理解机制显著提升评估挑战性，模型表现呈现梯度分化。模型在语句组合复杂度增加时准确率下降趋势验证设计有效性。

Conclusion: Encyclo-K通过知识语句单元化和动态生成技术，构建了可周期性更新的抗污染评估基准，实现了多知识点综合理解能力评估。通过形式化标注流程降低90%人工成本，其指数级增长的组合空间为持续性模型评估提供可扩展框架。实验验证了其强判别能力和测试集稳定性。

Abstract: Benchmarks play a crucial role in tracking the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) and identifying their capability boundaries. However, existing benchmarks predominantly curate questions at the question level, suffering from three fundamental limitations: vulnerability to data contamination, restriction to single-knowledge-point assessment, and reliance on costly domain expert annotation. We propose Encyclo-K, a statement-based benchmark that rethinks benchmark construction from the ground up. Our key insight is that knowledge statements, not questions, can serve as the unit of curation, and questions can then be constructed from them. We extract standalone knowledge statements from authoritative textbooks and dynamically compose them into evaluation questions through random sampling at test time. This design directly addresses all three limitations: the combinatorial space is too vast to memorize, and model rankings remain stable across dynamically generated question sets, enabling reliable periodic dataset refresh; each question aggregates 8-10 statements for comprehensive multi-knowledge assessment; annotators only verify formatting compliance without requiring domain expertise, substantially reducing annotation costs. Experiments on over 50 LLMs demonstrate that Encyclo-K poses substantial challenges with strong discriminative power. Even the top-performing OpenAI-GPT-5.1 achieves only 62.07% accuracy, and model performance displays a clear gradient distribution--reasoning models span from 16.04% to 62.07%, while chat models range from 9.71% to 50.40%. These results validate the challenges introduced by dynamic evaluation and multi-statement comprehensive understanding. These findings establish Encyclo-K as a scalable framework for dynamic evaluation of LLMs' comprehensive understanding over multiple fine-grained disciplinary knowledge statements.

TL;DR: 提出mHC框架，在扩展残差连接的同时恢复身份映射属性，解决训练不稳定和内存开销问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统残差连接的单一模式限制性能，而HC扩展流宽和连接模式虽可提升性能但破坏身份映射，导致训练不稳定、可扩展性差且内存开销大。

Method: 通过流形投影约束将HC残差空间映射到保持身份映射的流形结构，并进行基础设施优化以减少内存访问开销。

Result: mHC在大规模训练中实现7.2%训练效率提升，性能优于ViT-H/14模型，且支持更大规模模型扩展。

Conclusion: mHC作为HC的有效改进框架，在保持拓扑灵活性的同时恢复核心的恒等映射机制，为深度模型架构设计提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recently, studies exemplified by Hyper-Connections (HC) have extended the ubiquitous residual connection paradigm established over the past decade by expanding the residual stream width and diversifying connectivity patterns. While yielding substantial performance gains, this diversification fundamentally compromises the identity mapping property intrinsic to the residual connection, which causes severe training instability and restricted scalability, and additionally incurs notable memory access overhead. To address these challenges, we propose Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections (mHC), a general framework that projects the residual connection space of HC onto a specific manifold to restore the identity mapping property, while incorporating rigorous infrastructure optimization to ensure efficiency. Empirical experiments demonstrate that mHC is effective for training at scale, offering tangible performance improvements and superior scalability. We anticipate that mHC, as a flexible and practical extension of HC, will contribute to a deeper understanding of topological architecture design and suggest promising directions for the evolution of foundational models.

TL;DR: BEDA利用信念估计作为约束，提升多场景下策略对话的成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为解决现有工作虽能准确估计信念但缺乏有效利用机制的问题，研究提出了一种基于信念约束的框架。

Method: 建立包含世界集合、信念估计器、条件生成器的BEDA框架，通过概率约束实现对抗与协作对话行为的协同。

Result: 在CKBG、Mutual Friends和CaSiNo三个场景中成功率分别提升5.0、9.3和实现最优交易的显著效果。

Conclusion: 将信念估计转化为约束是提升策略对话可靠性的一种简单通用机制。

Abstract: Strategic dialogue requires agents to execute distinct dialogue acts, for which belief estimation is essential. While prior work often estimates beliefs accurately, it lacks a principled mechanism to use those beliefs during generation. We bridge this gap by first formalizing two core acts Adversarial and Alignment, and by operationalizing them via probabilistic constraints on what an agent may generate. We instantiate this idea in BEDA, a framework that consists of the world set, the belief estimator for belief estimation, and the conditional generator that selects acts and realizes utterances consistent with the inferred beliefs. Across three settings, Conditional Keeper Burglar (CKBG, adversarial), Mutual Friends (MF, cooperative), and CaSiNo (negotiation), BEDA consistently outperforms strong baselines: on CKBG it improves success rate by at least 5.0 points across backbones and by 20.6 points with GPT-4.1-nano; on Mutual Friends it achieves an average improvement of 9.3 points; and on CaSiNo it achieves the optimal deal relative to all baselines. These results indicate that casting belief estimation as constraints provides a simple, general mechanism for reliable strategic dialogue.

TL;DR: 论文提出了ADOPT框架，用于优化多步骤大语言模型（LLM）的提示链，通过建模步骤间依赖关系和梯度估计，解决传统方法因缺乏步骤监督及依赖处理不当导致的优化难题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多步骤LLM依赖每一步提示的质量，但传统端到端优化因步骤间依赖性强和缺乏局部监督信号而面临困难，导致优化效果不稳定。本文旨在解决这一问题，提升提示优化的稳定性和效果。

Method: ADOPT通过显式建模每一步LLM处理与最终任务结果的依赖关系，进行类似解析梯度估计的文本梯度计算；将梯度估计与更新解耦，将多提示优化分解为单提示步骤；结合Shapley机制动态分配各步的优化资源。

Result: 实验证明在真实数据集和多种流水线结构中，ADOPT始终优于现有多提示优化方法，具有更强的鲁棒性和稳定性。

Conclusion: ADOPT为多步骤LLM提示优化创建了一个依赖感知、资源整合的框架，有效解决了传统方法的不足，为复杂任务流水线优化提供了可靠方案。

Abstract: Multi-step LLM pipelines invoke large language models multiple times in a structured sequence and can effectively solve complex tasks, but their performance heavily depends on the prompts used at each step. Jointly optimizing these prompts is difficult due to missing step-level supervision and inter-step dependencies. Existing end-to-end prompt optimization methods struggle under these conditions and often yield suboptimal or unstable updates. We propose ADOPT, an Adaptive Dependency-aware Prompt Optimization framework for multi-step LLM pipelines. ADOPT explicitly models the dependency between each LLM step and the final task outcome, enabling precise text-gradient estimation analogous to computing analytical derivatives. It decouples textual gradient estimation from gradient updates, reducing multi-prompt optimization to flexible single-prompt optimization steps, and employs a Shapley-based mechanism to adaptively allocate optimization resources. Experiments on real-world datasets and diverse pipeline structures show that ADOPT is effective and robust, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art prompt optimization baselines.

This means that feeding full documents to a Transformers-based models for classification might be impossible, expensive or slow. Thus, we present a legal document classifier based on DeBERTa V3 and a LSTM, that uses as input a collection of 48 randomly-selected short chunks (max 128 tokens). Besides, we present its deployment pipeline using Temporal, a durable execution solution, which allow us to have a reliable and robust processing workflow. The best model had a weighted F-score of 0.898, while the pipeline running on CPU had a processing median time of 498 seconds per 100 files.

*Nasim Borazjanizadeh,James McClelland*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出Thought Gestalt (TG)模型，通过结合token级和句子级表征提升Transformer的语言理解稳定性与效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer因依赖局部共现统计而缺乏全局一致性表征，导致关系方向错误（如反向诅咒）、上下文误差及数据效率低下，而人类理解依赖持久的抽象事件表征。

Method: TG采用双层次建模：1) token生成与句子级'thought'表征共享参数；2) 通过跨注意力机制关联长期记忆中的句子表征；3) 用单一next-token目标训练，反向传播通过跨注意力优化历史表征。

Result: 相比GPT-2，TG提升效率：1) 需少5-8%数据与33-42%参数即达相同损失；2) 在父亲-儿子关系反向任务中减少错误。

Conclusion: 将显式句子表征纳入Transformer架构，在保持简洁性的同时提升了语言模型的记忆连贯性与泛化能力。

Abstract: Transformer language models can generate strikingly natural text by modeling language as a sequence of tokens. Yet, by relying primarily on surface-level co-occurrence statistics, they fail to form globally consistent latent representations of entities and events, lack of which contributes to brittleness in relational direction (e.g., reversal curse), contextualization errors, and data inefficiency. On the other hand, cognitive science shows that human comprehension involves converting the input linguistic stream into compact, event-like representations that persist in memory while verbatim form is short-lived. Motivated by this view, we introduce Thought Gestalt (TG) model, a recurrent Transformer that models language at two levels of abstraction - tokens and sentence-level "thought" states. TG generates the tokens of one sentence at a time while cross-attending to a memory of prior sentence representations. In TG, token and sentence representations are generated using the same set of model parameters and trained with a single objective, the next-token cross-entropy: by retaining the computation graph of sentence representations written to memory, gradients from future token losses flow backward through cross-attention to optimize the parameters generating earlier sentence vectors. In scaling experiments, TG consistently improves efficiency over matched GPT-2 runs, among other baselines, with scaling fits indicating GPT-2 requires ~5-8% more data and ~33-42% more parameters to match TG's loss. TG also reduces errors on relational direction generalization on a father-son reversal curse probe.

TL;DR: AdaGReS通过减少冗余上下文优化RAG效率，在限定token预算下提升生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在解决标准top-k检索导致的上下文冗余问题，该问题会浪费token预算并降低下游生成效果。

Method: 构建包含相关性-冗余性联合目标的集合级优化框架，采用带边际增益计算的贪婪算法，并引入闭式解参数自适应校准机制。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在保证近优性的同时实现冗余控制与token预算平衡，为实际应用提供了理论保证和实用工具。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is highly sensitive to the quality of selected context, yet standard top-k retrieval often returns redundant or near-duplicate chunks that waste token budget and degrade downstream generation. We present AdaGReS, a redundancy-aware context selection framework for token-budgeted RAG that optimizes a set-level objective combining query-chunk relevance and intra-set redundancy penalties. AdaGReS performs greedy selection under a token-budget constraint using marginal gains derived from the objective, and introduces a closed-form, instance-adaptive calibration of the relevance-redundancy trade-off parameter to eliminate manual tuning and adapt to candidate-pool statistics and budget limits. We further provide a theoretical analysis showing that the proposed objective exhibits epsilon-approximate submodularity under practical embedding similarity conditions, yielding near-optimality guarantees for greedy selection. Experiments on open-domain question answering (Natural Questions) and a high-redundancy biomedical (drug) corpus demonstrate consistent improvements in redundancy control and context quality, translating to better end-to-end answer quality and robustness across settings.
