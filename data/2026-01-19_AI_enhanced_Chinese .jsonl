An Exploratory Study", "comment": null, "summary": "As robotics become increasingly integrated into construction workflows, their ability to interpret and respond to human behavior will be essential for enabling safe and effective collaboration. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as a promising tool for visual understanding tasks and offer the potential to recognize human behaviors without extensive domain-specific training. This capability makes them particularly appealing in the construction domain, where labeled data is scarce and monitoring worker actions and emotional states is critical for safety and productivity. In this study, we evaluate the performance of three leading VLMs, GPT-4o, Florence 2, and LLaVa-1.5, in detecting construction worker actions and emotions from static site images. Using a curated dataset of 1,000 images annotated across ten action and ten emotion categories, we assess each model's outputs through standardized inference pipelines and multiple evaluation metrics. GPT-4o consistently achieved the highest scores across both tasks, with an average F1-score of 0.756 and accuracy of 0.799 in action recognition, and an F1-score of 0.712 and accuracy of 0.773 in emotion recognition. Florence 2 performed moderately, with F1-scores of 0.497 for action and 0.414 for emotion, while LLaVa-1.5 showed the lowest overall performance, with F1-scores of 0.466 for action and 0.461 for emotion. Confusion matrix analyses revealed that all models struggled to distinguish semantically close categories, such as collaborating in teams versus communicating with supervisors. While the results indicate that general-purpose VLMs can offer a baseline capability for human behavior recognition in construction environments, further improvements, such as domain adaptation, temporal modeling, or multimodal sensing, may be needed for real-world reliability.", "AI": {"tldr": "This study evaluates the effectiveness of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like GPT-4o, Florence 2, and LLaVa-1.5 in recognizing construction workers' actions and emotions from images, with GPT-4o showing superior performance but highlighting the need for domain-specific improvements.", "motivation": "Construction environments face challenges in worker safety and productivity due to scarce labeled data for monitoring behaviors.

Experimental evaluation against a sub-optimal algorithmic opponent shows that entropy-aware adaptive reasoning substantially improves decision quality, increasing the average game outcome from \\(-11.6\\%\\) with the baseline LLM to \\(+9.5\\%\\) with entropy-guided adaptive reasoning over 100 games (win = +1, tie = 0, loss = -1), while maintaining a relatively low number of LLM queries per game.

While over 7,000 languages are spoken worldwide, only a small subset (fewer than 100) has sufficient digital presence to meaningfully influence modern LLM training. This disparity leads to systematic underperformance, cultural misalignment, and limited accessibility for speakers of low-resource and extreme-low-resource languages. To address this gap, we introduce Bring Your Own Language (BYOL), a unified framework for scalable, language-aware LLM development tailored to each language's digital footprint. BYOL begins with a language resource classification that maps languages into four tiers (Extreme-Low, Low, Mid, High) using curated web-scale corpora, and uses this classification to select the appropriate integration pathway. For low-resource languages, we propose a full-stack data refinement and expansion pipeline that combines corpus cleaning, synthetic text generation, continual pretraining, and supervised finetuning. Applied to Chichewa and Maori, this pipeline yields language-specific LLMs that achieve approximately 12 percent average improvement over strong multilingual baselines across 12 benchmarks, while preserving English and multilingual capabilities via weight-space model merging. For extreme-low-resource languages, we introduce a translation-mediated inclusion pathway, and show on Inuktitut that a tailored machine translation system improves over a commercial baseline by 4 BLEU, enabling high-accuracy LLM access when direct language modeling is infeasible. Finally, we release human-translated versions of the Global MMLU-Lite benchmark in Chichewa, Maori, and Inuktitut, and make our codebase and models publicly available at https://github.com/microsoft/byol .", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86BYOL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u8a00\u5206\u7ea7\u548c\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u7a0b\u63d0\u5347\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5168\u7403\u8bed\u8a00\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u5e03\u4e25\u91cd\u4e0d\u5747\uff0c7000\u591a\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u4ec5\u5c11\u6570\u5177\u6709\u8db3\u591f\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u8d44\u6e90\u53ef\u4f9b\u8bad\u7ec3\u73b0\u4ee3LLM\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u6587\u5316\u9002\u914d\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u53ca\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faBYOL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u56db\u5c42\u8bed\u8a00\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u7ea7\u4f53\u7cfb\uff08\u6781\u4f4e\u3001\u4f4e\u3001\u4e2d\u3001\u9ad8\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u6839\u636e\u5206\u7ea7\u91c7\u53d6\u4e0d\u540c\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff1a\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u6e05\u6d17\u3001\u5408\u6210\u751f\u6210\u3001\u6301\u7eed\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u5168\u6d41\u7a0b\u4f18\u5316\uff1b\u6781\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u91c7\u7528\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e2d\u4ecb\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "result": "\u5728Chichewa\u548cMaori\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b012%\u5e73\u5747\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff08\u5bf9\u6bd4\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff09\uff0cInuktitut\u8bed\u8a00\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fbe\u52304 BLEU\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7ef4\u62a4\u82f1\u8bed\u548c\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u53d1\u5e03\u4e09\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u7684Global MMLU-Lite\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u53ca\u5f00\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u8a00\u5206\u7ea7\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u6570\u636e\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3aLLM\u5bf9\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u4fdd\u6301\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u901a\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e2d\u4ecb\u8def\u5f84\u4e3a\u6781\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u884c\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This paper investigates the impact of reducing the captured knowledge from temporal data, while increasing the resolution of the frames. To establish this experiment, we created similar designs to the three originals, but with a dropout layer added before the final classifier. Secondly, we then developed ten new versions for each one of these three designs. The variants include special attention blocks within their architecture, such as convolutional block attention module (CBAM), temporal convolution networks (TCN), in addition to multi-headed and channel attention mechanisms. The purpose behind that is to observe the extent of the influence each of these blocks has on performance for the restricted-temporal models. The results of testing all the models on UCF101 have shown accuracy of 88.98% for the variant with multiheaded attention added to the modified R(2+1)D.

However, their direct applicability to medical image segmentation remains limited by severe domain shifts, the absence of privileged spatial prompts, and the need to reason over complex anatomical and volumetric structures. Here we present Medical SAM3, a foundation model for universal prompt-driven medical image segmentation, obtained by fully fine-tuning SAM3 on large-scale, heterogeneous 2D and 3D medical imaging datasets with paired segmentation masks and text prompts. Through a systematic analysis of vanilla SAM3, we observe that its performance degrades substantially on medical data, with its apparent competitiveness largely relying on strong geometric priors such as ground-truth-derived bounding boxes. These findings motivate full model adaptation beyond prompt engineering alone. By fine-tuning SAM3's model parameters on 33 datasets spanning 10 medical imaging modalities, Medical SAM3 acquires robust domain-specific representations while preserving prompt-driven flexibility. Extensive experiments across organs, imaging modalities, and dimensionalities demonstrate consistent and significant performance gains, particularly in challenging scenarios characterized by semantic ambiguity, complex morphology, and long-range 3D context. Our results establish Medical SAM3 as a universal, text-guided segmentation foundation model for medical imaging and highlight the importance of holistic model adaptation for achieving robust prompt-driven segmentation under severe domain shift.

Recent reasoning models outperform comparable instruction-tuned models on complex cognitive tasks, attributed to extended computation through longer chains of thought. Here we show that enhanced reasoning emerges not from extended computation alone, but from simulating multi-agent-like interactions -- a society of thought -- which enables diversification and debate among internal cognitive perspectives characterized by distinct personality traits and domain expertise. Through quantitative analysis and mechanistic interpretability methods applied to reasoning traces, we find that reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1 and QwQ-32B exhibit much greater perspective diversity than instruction-tuned models, activating broader conflict between heterogeneous personality- and expertise-related features during reasoning. This multi-agent structure manifests in conversational behaviors, including question-answering, perspective shifts, and the reconciliation of conflicting views, and in socio-emotional roles that characterize sharp back-and-forth conversations, together accounting for the accuracy advantage in reasoning tasks. Controlled reinforcement learning experiments reveal that base models increase conversational behaviors when rewarded solely for reasoning accuracy, and fine-tuning models with conversational scaffolding accelerates reasoning improvement over base models. These findings indicate that the social organization of thought enables effective exploration of solution spaces. We suggest that reasoning models establish a computational parallel to collective intelligence in human groups, where diversity enables superior problem-solving when systematically structured, which suggests new opportunities for agent organization to harness the wisdom of crowds.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ad8\u7ea7\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u6e90\u4e8e\u6a21\u62df\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4ea4\u4e92\uff08\u601d\u7ef4\u793e\u4f1a\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6837\u5316\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0e\u8fa9\u8bba\u5b9e\u73b0\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\u5c1a\u672a\u660e\u6670\uff0c\u957f\u94fe\u601d\u7ef4\uff08Chain-of-Thought\uff09\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u89e3\u91ca\u5176\u590d\u6742\u8ba4\u77e5\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u9700\u63a2\u7d22\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4ea4\u4e92\u6a21\u5f0f\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u9a71\u52a8\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u7814\u7a76\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982DeepSeek-R1\u3001QwQ-32B\uff09\u4e0e\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5bf9\u8bdd\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u5173\u8054\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0e\u7279\u5f81\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u8bdd\u884c\u4e3a\uff08\u5982\u89c6\u89d2\u8f6c\u6362\u3001\u51b2\u7a81\u89e3\u51b3\uff09\u53ca\u793e\u4ea4\u89d2\u8272\u4ea4\u4e92\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4efb\u52a1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff1b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6846\u67b6\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u4f18\u5316\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u793e\u4f1a\u4ea4\u4e92\u7ec4\u7ec7\u601d\u7ef4\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4eba\u7c7b\u96c6\u4f53\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u2014\u2014\u591a\u6837\u6027\u89c2\u70b9\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u6574\u5408\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u6269\u5c55\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

However, existing methods primarily rely on either sequence-level or action-level descriptions due to the absence of fine-grained, part-level motion annotations. This limits their controllability over individual body parts. In this work, we construct a high-quality motion dataset with atomic, temporally-aware part-level text annotations, leveraging the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Unlike prior datasets that either provide synchronized part captions with fixed time segments or rely solely on global sequence labels, our dataset captures asynchronous and semantically distinct part movements at fine temporal resolution. Based on this dataset, we introduce a diffusion-based part-aware motion generation framework, namely FrankenMotion, where each body part is guided by its own temporally-structured textual prompt. This is, to our knowledge, the first work to provide atomic, temporally-aware part-level motion annotations and have a model that allows motion generation with both spatial (body part) and temporal (atomic action) control. Experiments demonstrate that FrankenMotion outperforms all previous baseline models adapted and retrained for our setting, and our model can compose motions unseen during training.

We present EncodeRec, an approach designed to align textual representations with recommendation objectives while learning compact, informative embeddings directly from item descriptions. EncodeRec keeps the language model parameters frozen during recommender system training, making it computationally efficient without sacrificing semantic fidelity. Experiments across core recommendation benchmarks demonstrate its effectiveness both as a backbone for sequential recommendation models and for semantic ID tokenization, showing substantial gains over PLM-based and embedding model baselines.

Patients are simulated based on a five-dimensional persona structure. To address issues of the persona class imbalance, a portion of the dataset is augmented using few-shot generation, followed by manual verification.

We propose MMedExpert-R1, a novel reasoning MedVLM that addresses these challenges through domain-specific adaptation and clinical guideline reinforcement. We construct MMedExpert, a high-quality dataset of 10K samples across four specialties with step-by-step reasoning traces. Our Domain-Specific Adaptation (DSA) creates specialty-specific LoRA modules to provide diverse initialization, while Guideline-Based Advantages (GBA) explicitly models different clinical reasoning perspectives to align with real-world diagnostic strategies. Conflict-Aware Capability Integration then merges these specialized experts into a unified agent, ensuring robust multi-specialty alignment.

Current steering methods, such as prompting-based and activation-based approaches, are widely used to guide model behavior. However, activation-based techniques require deep access to internal layers, while prompting-based steering often fails to provide consistent or fine-grained control. In order to address these limitations, we propose a training-free inference-time logit intervention for controllable generation. Our approach utilizes a statistical token score table derived from z-normalized log-odds of labeled corpora to shift the decoding distribution. Empirical evaluations across three diverse datasets focusing on writing complexity, formality, and toxicity demonstrate that our method effectively steers output characteristics, confirming its broad applicability and task-agnostic nature.

We extend the action space of SiMT with four adaptive actions: Sentence_Cut, Drop, Partial_Summarization and Pronominalization, which enable real-time restructuring, omission, and simplification while preserving semantic fidelity. We adapt these actions in a large language model (LLM) framework and construct training references through action-aware prompting. To evaluate both quality and word-level monotonicity, we further develop a latency-aware TTS pipeline that maps textual outputs to speech with realistic timing.

This gap highlights a critical limitation in rendering rigid body motion, a core tenet of classical mechanics. While computer graphics and physics-based simulators can easily model such collisions using Newton formulas, modern pretrain-finetune paradigms discard the concept of object rigidity during pixel-level global denoising. Even perfectly correct mathematical constraints are treated as suboptimal solutions (i.e., conditions) during model optimization in post-training, fundamentally limiting the physical realism of generated videos. Motivated by these considerations, we introduce, for the first time, a physics-aware reinforcement learning paradigm for video generation models that enforces physical collision rules directly in high-dimensional spaces, ensuring the physics knowledge is strictly applied rather than treated as conditions. Subsequently, we extend this paradigm to a unified framework, termed Mimicry-Discovery Cycle (MDcycle), which allows substantial fine-tuning while fully preserving the model's ability to leverage physics-grounded feedback.

While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is widely adopted to improve grounding, confidence calibration in RAG settings remains poorly understood. We conduct a systematic study across four benchmarks, revealing that LLMs exhibit poor calibration performance due to noisy retrieved contexts. Specifically, contradictory or irrelevant evidence tends to inflate the model's false certainty, leading to severe overconfidence. To address this, we propose NAACL Rules (Noise-AwAre Confidence CaLibration Rules) to provide a principled foundation for resolving overconfidence under noise. We further design NAACL, a noise-aware calibration framework that synthesizes supervision from about 2K HotpotQA examples guided by these rules.

While existing methods excel in single-person animation, they struggle to handle arbitrary subject counts, diverse character types, and spatial misalignment between the reference image and the driving poses. We attribute these limitations to an overly rigid spatial binding that forces strict pixel-wise alignment between the pose and reference, and an inability to consistently rebind motion to intended subjects. To address these challenges, we propose CoDance, a novel Unbind-Rebind framework that enables the animation of arbitrary subject counts, types, and spatial configurations conditioned on a single, potentially misaligned pose sequence. Specifically, the Unbind module employs a novel pose shift encoder to break the rigid spatial binding between the pose and the reference by introducing stochastic perturbations to both poses and their latent features, thereby compelling the model to learn a location-agnostic motion representation. To ensure precise control and subject association, we then devise a Rebind module, leveraging semantic guidance from text prompts and spatial guidance from subject masks to direct the learned motion to intended characters. Furthermore, to facilitate comprehensive evaluation, we introduce a new multi-subject CoDanceBench.

To demystify this process, we leverage Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) and introduce a novel framework for identifying task-specific features. Our method first recalls features that are frequently co-activated on translation inputs and then filters them for functional coherence using a PCA-based consistency metric. This framework successfully isolates a small set of **translation initiation** features. Causal interventions demonstrate that amplifying these features steers the model towards correct translation, while ablating them induces hallucinations and off-task outputs, confirming they represent a core component of the model's innate translation competency. Moving from analysis to application, we leverage this mechanistic insight to propose a new data selection strategy for efficient fine-tuning.

Experiments show this approach significantly improves data efficiency and suppresses hallucinations. Furthermore, we find these mechanisms are transferable to larger models of the same family.

However, these methods often suffer from suboptimal graph structures, particularly due to sparse connections at boundary points and noisy connections in junction areas. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method that integrates a graph smoothing module with an enhanced local geometry learning module. Specifically, we identify the limitations of conventional graph structures, particularly in handling boundary points and junction areas. In response, we introduce a graph smoothing module designed to optimize the graph structure and minimize the negative impact of unreliable sparse and noisy connections.

Yet even strong VLMs aren't able to achieve this in one-shot as they lack fine-grained spatial and physical grounding capability. Our key insight is that closing this gap requires interleaved multimodal reasoning through iterative execution and verification. Stemming from this, we present VIGA (Vision-as-Inverse-Graphic Agent) that starts from an empty world and reconstructs or edits scenes through a closed-loop write-run-render-compare-revise procedure. To support long-horizon reasoning, VIGA combines (i) a skill library that alternates generator and verifier roles and (ii) an evolving context memory that contains plans, code diffs, and render history. VIGA is task-agnostic as it doesn't require auxiliary modules, covering a wide range of tasks such as 3D reconstruction, multi-step scene editing, 4D physical interaction, and 2D document editing, etc. Empirically, we found VIGA substantially improves one-shot baselines on BlenderGym (35.32%) and SlideBench (117.17%). Moreover, VIGA is also model-agnostic as it doesn't require finetuning, enabling a unified protocol to evaluate heterogeneous foundation VLMs. To better support this protocol, we introduce BlenderBench, a challenging benchmark that stress-tests interleaved multimodal reasoning with graphics engine, where VIGA improves by 124.70%.", "AI": {"tldr": "VIGA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9006\u5411\u56fe\u5f62\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u91cd\u5efa\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u7684\u5199-\u8fd0\u884c-\u6e32\u67d3-\u6bd4\u8f83-\u4fee\u6539\u5faa\u73af\uff0c\u4ece\u7a7a\u4e16\u754c\u9010\u6b65\u91cd\u6784\u6216\u7f16\u8f91\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6280\u80fd\u5e93\u548c\u6f14\u8fdb\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7a7a\u95f4\u7269\u7406\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u5355\u6b21\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u5c06\u56fe\u50cf\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u56fe\u5f62\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4ea4\u9519\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u957f\u671f\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1VIGA\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u4ea4\u66ff\u751f\u6210\u5668/\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u6280\u80fd\u5e93\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ee3\u7801\u8fed\u4ee3 2\uff09\u5305\u542b\u4ee3\u7801\u5dee\u5206/\u6e32\u67d3\u5386\u53f2\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6a21\u5757\u652f\u6301\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u4efb\u52a1 3\uff09\u901a\u7528\u534f\u8bae\u9002\u914d3D/4D/2D\u7f16\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1 4\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1BlenderBench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u56fe\u5f62\u5f15\u64ce\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b", "result": "\u5728BlenderGym\u548cSlideBench\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u534735.32%\u548c117.17%\uff0c\u5728\u4e13\u7528BlenderBench\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0124.70%\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u652f\u6301\u591a\u6b65\u8fed\u4ee3\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u9006\u5411\u56fe\u5f62\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u514d\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u5e76\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u538b\u529b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u89c6\u89c9\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ece\u611f\u77e5\u5230\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\u8f6c\u6362\u3002"}}

While Knowledge Graphs (KGs) offer explicit grounding, existing paradigms of KG-augmented LLMs typically exhibit cognitive rigidity--applying homogeneous search strategies that render them vulnerable to instability under neighborhood noise and structural misalignment leading to reasoning stagnation. To address these challenges, we propose CoG, a training-free framework inspired by Dual-Process Theory that mimics the interplay between intuition and deliberation. First, functioning as the fast, intuitive process, the Relational Blueprint Guidance module leverages relational blueprints as interpretable soft structural constraints to rapidly stabilize the search direction against noise. Second, functioning as the prudent, analytical process, the Failure-Aware Refinement module intervenes upon encountering reasoning impasses. It triggers evidence-conditioned reflection and executes controlled backtracking to overcome reasoning stagnation. Experimental results on three benchmarks demonstrate that CoG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both accuracy and efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\uff08KGs\uff09\u589e\u5f3a\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u50f5\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u8bad\u7ec3\u514d\u8d39\u6846\u67b6CoG\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u76f4\u89c9\u5feb\u601d\u4e0e\u5ba1\u614e\u6162\u60f3\u53cc\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709KG\u589e\u5f3aLLMs\u4f9d\u8d56\u5355\u4e00\u641c\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u9762\u4e34\u4e09\u91cd\u6311\u6218\uff1a1\uff09\u90bb\u57df\u566a\u58f0\u5e72\u6270\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u5411\uff1b2\uff09KG\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u95ee\u9898\u903b\u8f91\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff1b3\uff09\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6613\u9677\u5165\u505c\u6ede\u3002\u9700\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "1) \u76f4\u89c9\u5f15\u64ce\uff1a\u5173\u7cfb\u84dd\u56fe\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u5757\u5229\u7528\u8f6f\u7ed3\u6784\u7ea6\u675f\u5feb\u901f\u7a33\u5b9a\u641c\u7d22\u65b9\u5411\uff1b2) \u5ba1\u614e\u5f15\u64ce\uff1a\u5931\u8d25\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u5757\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u5361\u987f\u65f6\u89e6\u53d1\u8bc1\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u53cd\u601d\u4e0e\u53ef\u63a7\u56de\u6eaf\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u4fee\u6b63\u9519\u8bef\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cCoG\u76f8\u8f83\u524d\u6cbf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b017.2%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u9ad83\u500d\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u9ad8\u566a\u58f0\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u4fdd\u630186%\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53cc\u91cd\u8ba4\u77e5\u7406\u8bba\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3KG-LLM\u534f\u540c\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u50f5\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u901a\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Recent work uses Score Distillation Sampling to generate aligned 3D models, but SDS is known to be time-consuming, prone to mode collapse, and often provides cartoonish results. By contrast, our suggested approach relies on the joint transport of a segment in the sample space, yielding faster computation at inference time. Our approach can be built on top of an arbitrary Rectified Flow model operating on the structured latent space. We show the applicability of our method to the domains of image, video, and 3D shape generation using state-of-the-art baselines and evaluate it against both editing-based and joint inference-based competing approaches. We demonstrate a high degree of structural alignment for the sample pairs obtained with our method and a high visual quality of the samples.

To tackle UMS-ReID, we introduce image-text knowledge modeling (ITKM) -- a three-stage framework that effectively exploits the representational power of vision-language models. We start with a pre-trained CLIP model with an image encoder and a text encoder. In Stage I, we introduce a scenario embedding in the image encoder and fine-tune the encoder to adaptively leverage knowledge from multiple scenarios. In Stage II, we optimize a set of learned text embeddings to associate with pseudo-labels from Stage I and introduce a multi-scenario separation loss to increase the divergence between inter-scenario text representations. In Stage III, we first introduce cluster-level and instance-level heterogeneous matching modules to obtain reliable heterogeneous positive pairs (e.g., a visible image and an infrared image of the same person) within each scenario. Next, we propose a dynamic text representation update strategy to maintain consistency between text and image supervision signals.

However, their significant data requirements present a major challenge in the data-scarce context of most robotic learning settings, where compact CNNs with strong inductive biases can be more easily optimized. To address this trade-off, we introduce X-Distill, a simple yet highly effective method that synergizes the strengths of both architectures. Our approach involves an offline, cross-architecture knowledge distillation, transferring the rich visual representations of a large, frozen DINOv2 teacher to a compact ResNet-18 student on the general-purpose ImageNet dataset. This distilled encoder, now endowed with powerful visual priors, is then jointly fine-tuned with a diffusion policy head on the target manipulation tasks.

While automated fact-checking methods have advanced in recent years, their effectiveness remains constrained by the scarcity of datasets that reflect these real-world complexities. To address this gap, we first present MultiCaption, a new dataset specifically designed for detecting contradictions in visual claims. Pairs of claims referring to the same image or video were labeled through multiple strategies to determine whether they contradict each other. The resulting dataset comprises 11,088 visual claims in 64 languages, offering a unique resource for building and evaluating misinformation-detection systems in truly multimodal and multilingual environments. We then provide comprehensive experiments using transformer-based architectures, natural language inference models, and large language models, establishing strong baselines for future research. The results show that MultiCaption is more challenging than standard NLI tasks, requiring task-specific finetuning for strong performance.

In this work, we reveal that controlling the language used during model thinking-the language of thought-provides a novel and structural source of output diversity. Our preliminary study shows that different thinking languages occupy distinct regions in a model's thinking space. Based on this observation, we study two repeated sampling strategies under multilingual thinking-Single-Language Sampling and Mixed-Language Sampling-and conduct diversity evaluation on outputs that are controlled to be in English, regardless of the thinking language used. Across extensive experiments, we demonstrate that switching the thinking language from English to non-English languages consistently increases output diversity, with a clear and consistent positive correlation such that languages farther from English in the thinking space yield larger gains. We further show that aggregating samples across multiple thinking languages yields additional improvements through compositional effects, and that scaling sampling with linguistic heterogeneity expands the model's diversity ceiling. Finally, we show that these findings translate into practical benefits in pluralistic alignment scenarios, leading to broader coverage of cultural knowledge and value orientations in LLM outputs.

We present SAMannot, an open-source, local framework that integrates the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) into a human-in-the-loop workflow. To address the high resource requirements of foundation models, we modified the SAM2 dependency and implemented a processing layer that minimizes computational overhead and maximizes throughput, ensuring a highly responsive user interface. Key features include persistent instance identity management, an automated ``lock-and-refine'' workflow with barrier frames, and a mask-skeletonization-based auto-prompting mechanism. SAMannot facilitates the generation of research-ready datasets in YOLO and PNG formats alongside structured interaction logs.

A promising approach to rectify these flaws is correcting LLMs using feedback. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce FactCorrector, a new post-hoc correction method that adapts across domains without retraining and leverages structured feedback about the factuality of the original response to generate a correction.

Transformer-based models struggle in this setting because memory grows quadratically with token count, constraining either the contextual scope or the spatial resolution. We introduce CASWiT (Context-Aware Stage-Wise Transformer), a dual-branch, Swin-based architecture that injects global cues into fine-grained UHR features. A context encoder processes a downsampled neighborhood to capture long-range dependencies, while a high resolution encoder extracts detailed features from UHR patches. A cross-scale fusion module, combining cross-attention and gated feature injection, enriches high-resolution tokens with context. Beyond architecture, we propose a SimMIM-style pretraining. We mask 75% of the high-resolution image tokens and the low-resolution center region that spatially corresponds to the UHR patch, then train the shared dual-encoder with small decoder to reconstruct the UHR initial image. Extensive experiments on the large-scale IGN FLAIR-HUB aerial dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of CASWiT. Our method achieves 65.83% mIoU, outperforming RGB baselines by 1.78 points. On URUR, CASWiT achieves 49.1% mIoU, surpassing the current SoTA by +0.9% under the official evaluation protocol.

Classical Beer-Lambert (BL) color deconvolution is well-established for two- or three-stain settings, but becomes under-determined and unstable for multiplex IHC (mIHC) with K>3 chromogens. We present a simple, data-driven encoder-decoder architecture that learns cohort-specific stain characteristics for mIHC RGB WSIs and yields crisp, well-separated per-stain concentration maps. The encoder is a compact U-Net that predicts K nonnegative concentration channels; the decoder is a differentiable BL forward model with a learnable stain matrix initialized from typical chromogen hues. Training is unsupervised with a perceptual reconstruction objective augmented by loss terms that discourage unnecessary stain mixing. On a colorectal mIHC panel comprising 5 stains (H, CDX2, MUC2, MUC5, CD8) we show excellent RGB reconstruction, and significantly reduced inter-channel bleed-through compared with matrix-based deconvolution.

While large proprietary models achieve strong performance, their closed weights, complexity, and high costs limit sustainability.

We propose \\textbf{multi-task learning (MTL)} as a more efficient alternative that fine-tunes a single model to perform claim detection, evidence ranking, and stance detection jointly. Using small decoder-only LLMs (e.g., Qwen3-4b), we explore three MTL strategies: classification heads, causal language modeling heads, and instruction-tuning, and evaluate them across model sizes, task orders, and standard non-LLM baselines. While multitask models do not universally surpass single-task baselines, they yield substantial improvements, achieving up to \\textbf{44\\%}, \\textbf{54\\%}, and \\textbf{31\\%} relative gains for claim detection, evidence re-ranking, and stance detection, respectively, over zero-/few-shot settings.

Our dual-modality cross-view learning approach outperforms the best single-modality models by up to $9.3\\%$, demonstrating that UAV and SV imagery provide valuable complementary perspectives on urban structures. The presence of vegetation surrounding buildings (versus no vegetation), brighter roofing (versus darker roofing), and roofing made of concrete, clay, or wood (versus metal or tarpaulin) are all significantly associated with lower HotSat-1 TIR values. Deployed across the city of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, the proposed framework illustrates how household-level inequalities in heat exposure - often linked to socio-economic disadvantage and reflected in building materials - can be identified and addressed using machine learning.

Extensive experiments on MLVU, LongVideoBench, and VideoMME demonstrate that TCS consistently improves performance across different MLLMs, boosting up to 6.9% accuracy, and is capable of achieving comparable accuracy with 50% fewer inference time cost, highlighting both efficiency and efficacy of TCS on long video understanding.", "AI": {"tldr": "TCS\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u67e5\u8be2\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u62bd\u6837\u63d0\u5347\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709MLLM\u5728\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u5904\u7406\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u548c\u5e27\u9009\u62e9\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u53cc\u7ec4\u4ef6\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1)\u591a\u67e5\u8be2\u63a8\u7406\u751f\u6210\u591a\u89d2\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\u63cf\u8ff0 2)\u5206\u6bb5\u6162\u5feb\u62bd\u6837\u5e73\u8861\u5c40\u90e8\u7ec6\u8282\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u53476.9%\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c1150%\uff0c\u5728MLVU\u7b49\u4e09\u5927\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6301\u7eed\u6709\u6548", "conclusion": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u975e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6548\u679c\u7684\u5e73\u8861"}}

In this work, we present the first open, instruction-following full-duplex conversational speech model that can be trained efficiently under typical academic resource constraints. By keeping the audio encoder frozen and finetuning only the language model, our model requires just 2,000 hours of data, without relying on large-scale pretraining or multi-stage optimization. The model can follow explicit instructions to control speaker voice, conversation topic, conversational behaviour (e.g., backchanneling and interruptions), and dialogue initiation.

Intrinsic noise in CIR triplets incurs intrinsic uncertainty and threatens the model's robustness. Probabilistic learning approaches have shown promise in addressing such issues; however, they fall short for CIR due to their instance-level holistic modeling and homogeneous treatment of queries and targets. This paper introduces a Heterogeneous Uncertainty-Guided (HUG) paradigm to overcome these limitations. HUG utilizes a fine-grained probabilistic learning framework, where queries and targets are represented by Gaussian embeddings that capture detailed concepts and uncertainties. We customize heterogeneous uncertainty estimations for multi-modal queries and uni-modal targets. Given a query, we capture uncertainties not only regarding uni-modal content quality but also multi-modal coordination, followed by a provable dynamic weighting mechanism to derive comprehensive query uncertainty. We further design uncertainty-guided objectives, including query-target holistic contrast and fine-grained contrasts with comprehensive negative sampling strategies, which effectively enhance discriminative learning.

However, such a refined representation for scene understanding incurs prohibitive computation and memory overhead, posing a major barrier to practical real-time deployment. To address this, we propose SUG-Occ, an explicit Semantics and Uncertainty Guided Sparse Learning Enabled 3D Occupancy Prediction Framework, which exploits the inherent sparsity of 3D scenes to reduce redundant computation while maintaining geometric and semantic completeness. Specifically, we first utilize semantic and uncertainty priors to suppress projections from free space during view transformation while employing an explicit unsigned distance encoding to enhance geometric consistency, producing a structurally consistent sparse 3D representation.

It is critical to develop models that can be reliably deployed for evaluating diverse open-ended scientific writing tasks while adhering to their distinct requirements. However, existing LLM-based judges and reward models are primarily optimized for general-purpose benchmarks with fixed scoring rubrics and evaluation criteria. Consequently, they often fail to reason over sparse knowledge of scientific domains when interpreting task-dependent and multi-faceted criteria. Moreover, fine-tuning for each individual task is costly and impractical for low-resource settings. To bridge these gaps, we propose cost-efficient, open-source reward models tailored for scientific writing evaluation.

Surprisingly, we find that medium-size models like Gemma-7B-IT frequently hallucinate, i.e., they have difficulty recognizing that the hallucinated fact is not part of their knowledge. We hypothesize that an important factor in causing these hallucinations is the linearity of the relation: linear relations tend to be stored more abstractly, making it difficult for the LLM to assess its knowledge; the facts of nonlinear relations tend to be stored more directly, making knowledge assessment easier. To investigate this hypothesis, we create SyntHal, a dataset of 6000 synthetic entities for six relations. In our experiments with four models, we determine, for each relation, the hallucination rate on SyntHal and also measure its linearity, using $\u0394\\cos$. We find a strong correlation ($r \\in [.78,.82]$) between relational linearity and hallucination rate, providing evidence for our hypothesis that the underlying storage of triples of a relation is a factor in how well a model can self-assess its knowledge.

We propose Generative Scenario Rollouts (GeRo), a plug-and-play framework for VLA models that jointly performs planning and generation of language-grounded future traffic scenes through an autoregressive rollout strategy. First, a VLA model is trained to encode ego vehicle and agent dynamics into latent tokens under supervision from planning, motion, and language tasks, facilitating text-aligned generation. Next, GeRo performs language-conditioned autoregressive generation. Given multi-view images, a scenario description, and ego-action questions, it generates future latent tokens and textual responses to guide long-horizon rollouts. A rollout-consistency loss stabilizes predictions using ground truth or pseudo-labels, mitigating drift and preserving text-action alignment. This design enables GeRo to perform temporally consistent, language-grounded rollouts that support long-horizon reasoning and multi-agent planning. On Bench2Drive, GeRo improves driving score and success rate by +15.7 and +26.2, respectively. By integrating reinforcement learning with generative rollouts, GeRo achieves state-of-the-art closed-loop and open-loop performance, demonstrating strong zero-shot robustness.

Developing domain-specific metrics has therefore been an active area of research, yet it remains challenging due to the lack of a unified, well-defined framework to assess their robustness and applicability in clinical contexts. To address this, we present CTest-Metric, a first unified metric assessment framework with three modules determining the clinical feasibility of metrics for CT RRG. The modules test: (i) Writing Style Generalizability (WSG) via LLM-based rephrasing; (ii) Synthetic Error Injection (SEI) at graded severities; and (iii) Metrics-vs-Expert correlation (MvE) using clinician ratings on 175 \"disagreement\" cases. Eight widely used metrics (BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, BERTScore-F1, F1-RadGraph, RaTEScore, GREEN Score, CRG) are studied across seven LLMs built on a CT-CLIP encoder. Using our novel framework, we found that lexical NLG metrics are highly sensitive to stylistic variations; GREEN Score aligns best with expert judgments (Spearman~0.70), while CRG shows negative correlation; and BERTScore-F1 is least sensitive to factual error injection.

Capturing these dynamics requires maintaining temporally consistent instance identities across intermittently captured 3D scans, even when changes are unobserved. We introduce and formalize the task of temporally sparse 4D indoor semantic instance segmentation (SIS), which jointly segments, identifies, and temporally associates object instances. This setting poses a challenge for existing 3DSIS methods, which require a discrete matching step due to their lack of temporal reasoning, and for 4D LiDAR approaches, which perform poorly due to their reliance on high-frequency temporal measurements that are uncommon in the longer-horizon evolution of indoor environments. We propose ReScene4D, a novel method that adapts 3DSIS architectures for 4DSIS without needing dense observations. It explores strategies to share information across observations, demonstrating that this shared context not only enables consistent instance tracking but also improves standard 3DSIS quality. To evaluate this task, we define a new metric, t-mAP, that extends mAP to reward temporal identity consistency.

This is a crucial question in understanding or discovering new concepts, e.g. in AI for science. We study this generalization question by evaluating a specific notion of generalizability: whether explanations produced by one LRM induce the same behavior when given to other LRMs. We find that CoT explanations often exhibit this form of generalization (i.e. they increase consistency between LRMs) and that this increased generalization is correlated with human preference rankings and post-training with reinforcement learning. We further analyze the conditions under which explanations yield consistent answers and propose a straightforward, sentence-level ensembling strategy that improves consistency.

Such conditions are rarely met in real-world scenarios. We present ShapeR, a novel approach for conditional 3D object shape generation from casually captured sequences. Given an image sequence, we leverage off-the-shelf visual-inertial SLAM, 3D detection algorithms, and vision-language models to extract, for each object, a set of sparse SLAM points, posed multi-view images, and machine-generated captions. A rectified flow transformer trained to effectively condition on these modalities then generates high-fidelity metric 3D shapes. To ensure robustness to the challenges of casually captured data, we employ a range of techniques including on-the-fly compositional augmentations, a curriculum training scheme spanning object- and scene-level datasets, and strategies to handle background clutter. Additionally, we introduce a new evaluation benchmark comprising 178 in-the-wild objects across 7 real-world scenes with geometry annotations. Experiments show that ShapeR significantly outperforms existing approaches in this challenging setting, achieving an improvement of 2.7x in Chamfer distance compared to state of the art.", "AI": {"tldr": "ShapeR\u4f7f\u7528SLAM,\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u7b49\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6761\u4ef6,\u901a\u8fc7\u6d41\u53d8\u6362\u751f\u6210\u5668\u548c\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565,\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u7ea6\u675f\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf3D\u5f62\u72b6\u751f\u6210,\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5c06Chamfer\u8ddd\u79bb\u964d\u4f4e2.7\u500d", "motivation": "\u73b0\u67093D\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u7406\u60f3\u8f93\u5165\u6761\u4ef6(\u6e05\u6d01/\u672a\u906e\u6321/\u5206\u5272\u7cbe\u786e),\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5e38\u5b58\u5728\u906e\u6321/\u6df7\u4e71\u80cc\u666f\u7b49\u6311\u6218,\u7f3a\u5c11\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5", "method": "\u8054\u5408\u4f7f\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u60ef\u5bfcSLAM(\u83b7\u53d6\u7a00\u758f\u70b9\u4e91)\u30013D\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u5165\u6761\u4ef6,\u6784\u5efa\u6d41\u53d8\u6362\u751f\u6210\u5668,\u7ed3\u5408\u52a8\u6001\u7ec4\u5408\u589e\u5f3a\u3001\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u3001\u80cc\u666f\u5904\u7406\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3,\u5efa\u7acb\u5305\u542b7\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u573a\u666f178\u4e2a\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u8bc4\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7b97\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd", "result": "\u5728\u63d0\u51fa\u7684in-the-wild\u6570\u636e\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a,Chamfer\u8ddd\u79bb\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u53472.7\u500d,\u5b9a\u91cf\u663e\u793a\u7b97\u6cd5\u5bf9\u906e\u6321\u3001\u80cc\u666f\u6df7\u4e71\u7b49\u73b0\u5b9e\u6311\u6218\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027,\u652f\u6301\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u751f\u6210", "conclusion": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6761\u4ef6\u878d\u5408\u4e0e\u6d41\u53d8\u6362\u751f\u6210\u67b6\u6784\u662f\u89e3\u51b3\u975e\u7406\u60f3\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f3D\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6709\u6548\u601d\u8def,\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565(\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60+\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a)\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf,\u5efa\u7acb\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u57fa\u51c6\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u8bc4\u6d4b\u7a7a\u767d"}}

A Brief Empirical Analysis of Tokenizers", "comment": null, "summary": "Frontier LLMs are increasingly utilised across academia, society and industry. A commonly used unit for comparing models, their inputs and outputs, and estimating inference pricing is the token. In general, tokens are used as a stable currency, assumed to be broadly consistent across tokenizers and contexts, enabling direct comparisons. However, tokenization varies significantly across models and domains of text, making naive interpretation of token counts problematic. We quantify this variation by providing a comprehensive empirical analysis of tokenization, exploring the compression of sequences to tokens across different distributions of textual data. Our analysis challenges commonly held heuristics about token lengths, finding them to be overly simplistic. We hope the insights of our study add clarity and intuition toward tokenization in contemporary LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2dtokenization\u5b58\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u9886\u57df\u95f4\u7684\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u6bd4\u8f83\u548c\u5b9a\u4ef7\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u4ee5token\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u8ba1\u91cf\u5355\u4f4d\u4f46\u5ffd\u89c6tokenization\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u6bd4\u8f83\u548c\u6210\u672c\u4f30\u7b97\u5b58\u5728\u504f\u5dee\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u8de8\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u6587\u672c\u9886\u57df\u8fdb\u884ctokenization\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e8f\u5217\u538b\u7f29\u7387\u53d8\u5316\u89c4\u5f8b", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0token\u957f\u5ea6\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6cd5\u5219\u5728\u6a21\u578b/\u9886\u57df\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u6587\u672c-\u5b57\u7b26\u6362\u7b97\u516c\u5f0f\u8bef\u5dee\u53ef\u8fbe400%", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u9700\u5c06tokenization\u5dee\u5f02\u7eb3\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3aAPI\u5b9a\u4ef7\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u89c4\u5212\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2"}}

Existing approaches, typically based on parameter-shared autoregressive architectures, frequently lead to compromised performance in one or both tasks. To address this, we present UniX, a next-generation unified medical foundation model for chest X-ray understanding and generation. UniX decouples the two tasks into an autoregressive branch for understanding and a diffusion branch for high-fidelity generation. Crucially, a cross-modal self-attention mechanism is introduced to dynamically guide the generation process with understanding features. Coupled with a rigorous data cleaning pipeline and a multi-stage training strategy, this architecture enables synergistic collaboration between tasks while leveraging the strengths of diffusion models for superior generation. On two representative benchmarks, UniX achieves a 46.1% improvement in understanding performance (Micro-F1) and a 24.2% gain in generation quality (FD-RadDino), using only a quarter of the parameters of LLM-CXR. By achieving performance on par with task-specific models, our work establishes a scalable paradigm for synergistic medical image understanding and generation.
