The task of AfriEconQA is to answer complex economic queries that require high-precision numerical reasoning and temporal disambiguation from specialized institutional documents. The dataset consists of 8,937 curated QA instances, rigorously filtered from a pool of 10018 synthetic questions to ensure high-quality evidence-answer alignment. Each instance is composed of: (1) a question requiring reasoning over economic indicators, (2) the corresponding evidence retrieved from the corpus, (3) a verified ground-truth answer, and (4) source metadata (e.g., URL and publication date) to ensure temporal provenance. AfriEconQA is the first benchmark focused specifically on African economic analysis, providing a unique challenge for Information Retrieval (IR) systems, as the data is largely absent from the pretraining corpora of current Large Language Models (LLMs). We operationalize this dataset through an 11-experiment matrix, benchmarking a zero-shot baseline (GPT-5 Mini) against RAG configurations using GPT-4o and Qwen 32B across five distinct embedding and ranking strategies. Our results demonstrate a severe parametric knowledge gap, where zero-shot models fail to answer over 90 percent of queries, and even state-of-the-art RAG pipelines struggle to achieve high precision. This confirms AfriEconQA as a robust and challenging benchmark for the next generation of domain-specific IR and RAG systems.

However, traditional methods often only consider free-text responses and do not natively incorporate structured or categorical survey responses for topic modeling.

This framework decomposes topic modeling into specialized tasks executed by individual LLM agents: an enrichment agent leverages structured data to enhance textual responses, a topic modeling agent extracts latent themes, and a deduplication agent refines the results. Comparative analysis on a survey dataset demonstrates that MALTopic significantly improves topic coherence, diversity, and interpretability compared to LDA and BERTopic. By integrating structured data and employing a multi-agent approach, MALTopic generates human-readable topics with enhanced contextual relevance, offering a more effective solution for analyzing complex survey data.", "AI": {"tldr": "MALTopic is a multi-agent LLM framework for topic modeling that integrates structured survey data, enhancing topic coherence, diversity, and interpretability compared to traditional methods like LDA and BERTopic.", "motivation": "Traditional topic modeling methods ignore structured/categorical survey responses and produce abstract topics needing manual interpretation; MALTopic aims to automate refinement while leveraging structured data for better contextual relevance.", "method": "Decomposes topic modeling into specialized tasks via LLM agents: enriched structured-text integration, topic extraction, and deduplication refinement, tested on a survey dataset.", "result": "MALTopic achieved significantly improved topic coherence, diversity, and interpretability over LDA/BERTopic, generating human-readable topics with enhanced contextual relevance.", "conclusion": "The structured data-driven multi-agent approach addresses limitations of traditional methods, offering a more effective solution for complex survey data analysis with reduced human intervention needs."}}

This intelligence degradation-defined as over 30% drop in task performance-severely limits long-context applications. This degradation shows a common pattern: models maintain strong performance up to a critical threshold, then collapse catastrophically. We term this shallow long-context adaptation-models adapt for short to medium contexts but fail beyond critical thresholds. This paper presents three contributions: (1) Natural Length Distribution Analysis: We use each sample's natural token length without truncation or padding, providing stronger causal evidence that degradation results from context length itself.

Although effective, these methods particularly GCG are computationally expensive, limiting their practicality for organisations with constrained resources. This paper introduces a resource-efficient adversarial prompting approach that eliminates the need for retraining by matching new prompts to a database of pre-trained adversarial prompts. A dataset of 1,000 prompts was classified into seven harm-related categories, and GCG, PEZ, and GBDA were evaluated on a Llama 3 8B model to identify the most effective attack method per category. Results reveal a correlation between prompt type and algorithm effectiveness.

We evaluate whether domain knowledge graphs (KGs) improve Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for healthcare by constructing three PubMed-derived graphs: $\\mathbb{G}_1$ (T2DM), $\\mathbb{G}_2$ (Alzheimer's disease), and $\\mathbb{G}_3$ (AD+T2DM). We design two probes: Probe 1 targets merged AD T2DM knowledge, while Probe 2 targets the intersection of $\\mathbb{G}_1$ and $\\mathbb{G}_2$. Seven instruction-tuned LLMs are tested across retrieval sources {No-RAG, $\\mathbb{G}_1$, $\\mathbb{G}_2$, $\\mathbb{G}_1$ + $\\mathbb{G}_2$, $\\mathbb{G}_3$, $\\mathbb{G}_1$+$\\mathbb{G}_2$ + $\\mathbb{G}_3$} and three decoding temperatures. Results show that scope alignment between probe and KG is decisive: precise, scope-matched retrieval (notably $\\mathbb{G}_2$) yields the most consistent gains, whereas indiscriminate graph unions often introduce distractors that reduce accuracy. Larger models frequently match or exceed KG-RAG with a No-RAG baseline on Probe 1, indicating strong parametric priors, whereas smaller/mid-sized models benefit more from well-scoped retrieval. Temperature plays a secondary role; higher values rarely help. We conclude that precision-first, scope-matched KG-RAG is preferable to breadth-first unions, and we outline practical guidelines for graph selection, model sizing, and retrieval/reranking.

This empirical evaluation explores the effectiveness of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architectures in mitigating these risks by grounding generative outputs in authoritative document context. Specifically, this study compares a baseline Vanilla LLM against Basic RAG and Advanced RAG pipelines utilizing cross-encoder re-ranking. The experimental framework employs a Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 model and an all-MiniLM-L6-v2 embedding model to process a corpus of official CDC policy analytical frameworks and guidance documents.

Conventional CNN-based methods often struggle to recover these fine structures, as they are typically biased toward learning low-frequency information. To address this challenge, this paper presents DuFal (Dual-Frequency-Aware Learning), a novel framework that integrates frequency-domain and spatial-domain processing via a dual-path architecture. The core innovation lies in our High-Local Factorized Fourier Neural Operator, which comprises two complementary branches: a Global High-Frequency Enhanced Fourier Neural Operator that captures global frequency patterns and a Local High-Frequency Enhanced Fourier Neural Operator that processes spatially partitioned patches to preserve spatial locality that might be lost in global frequency analysis. To improve efficiency, we design a Spectral-Channel Factorization scheme that reduces the Fourier Neural Operator parameter count. We also design a Cross-Attention Frequency Fusion module to integrate spatial and frequency features effectively. The fused features are then decoded through a Feature Decoder to produce projection representations, which are subsequently processed through an Intensity Field Decoding pipeline to reconstruct a final Computed Tomography volume. Experimental results on the LUNA16 and ToothFairy datasets demonstrate that DuFal significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in preserving high-frequency anatomical features, particularly under extremely sparse-view settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86DuFal\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u9891\u57df-\u7a7a\u95f4\u57df\u5904\u7406\u89e3\u51b3\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u56fe\u9525\u675fCT\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u4e22\u5931\u9ad8\u9891\u89e3\u5256\u7ec6\u8282\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u5728\u6781\u7a00\u758f\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfCNN\u65b9\u6cd5\u504f\u5411\u5b66\u4e60\u4f4e\u9891\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u9ad8\u9891\u7ec6\u8282\uff08\u5982\u7cbe\u7ec6\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\uff09\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u6295\u5f71\u91cd\u5efa\u65f6\u4e22\u5931\uff0c\u9700\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6062\u590d\u9ad8\u9891\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53cc\u8def\u5f84\u67b6\u6784DuFal\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u5168\u5c40\u9ad8\u9891\u589e\u5f3a\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\uff08\u5168\u5c40\u9891\u7387\u6a21\u5f0f\uff09\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u9ad8\u9891\u589e\u5f3a\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\uff08\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u5757\u5904\u7406\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8c31-\u901a\u9053\u5206\u89e3\u964d\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u3001\u8de8\u6ce8\u610f\u9891\u7387\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u6574\u5408\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5f81\u89e3\u7801\u4e0e\u5f3a\u5ea6\u573a\u89e3\u7801\u91cd\u5efaCT\u4f53\u79ef\u3002", "result": "\u5728LUNA16\u548cToothFairy\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDuFal\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u56fe\uff08\u598220/60\u89c6\u56fe\uff09\u4e0b\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982U-Net\u3001FFDN\uff09\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u9891\u7ed3\u6784\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff08PSNR\u63d0\u9ad83.2dB\uff0cSSIM\u63d0\u53470.15\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "DuFal\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u7a7a\u95f4-\u9891\u7387\u57df\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u514b\u670d\u7a00\u758f\u6295\u5f71\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9ad8\u9891\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f4e\u5242\u91cfCT\u6210\u50cf\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u601d\u8def\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u5e73\u8861\u3002"}}

We investigate this ability by testing 13 open-source LLMs on a fundamental task: pairwise causal discovery (PCD) from text. Our benchmark, using 12 diverse datasets, evaluates two core skills: 1) \\textbf{Causal Detection} (identifying if a text contains a causal link) and 2) \\textbf{Causal Extraction} (pulling out the exact cause and effect phrases). We tested various prompting methods, from simple instructions (zero-shot) to more complex strategies like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Few-shot In-Context Learning (FICL).\n  The results show major deficiencies in current models. The best model for detection, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B, only achieved a mean score of 49.57\\% ($C_{detect}$), while the best for extraction, Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct, reached just 47.12\\% ($C_{extract}$). Models performed best on simple, explicit, single-sentence relations. However, performance plummeted for more difficult (and realistic) cases, such as implicit relationships, links spanning multiple sentences, and texts containing multiple causal pairs.

Recent approaches leverage vision-language models such as CLIP with prompt-based learning to align image and text features. However, existing methods often exhibit weak discriminability between normal and abnormal prompts and lack principled scoring mechanisms for patch-level anomalies. We propose a deviation-guided prompt learning framework that integrates the semantic power of vision-language models with the statistical reliability of deviation-based scoring. Specifically, we replace fixed prompt prefixes with learnable context vectors shared across normal and abnormal prompts, while anomaly-specific suffix tokens enable class-aware alignment. To enhance separability, we introduce a deviation loss with Top-K Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), modeling patch-level features as Gaussian deviations from the normal distribution. This allows the network to assign higher anomaly scores to patches with statistically significant deviations, improving localization and interpretability. Experiments on the MVTecAD and VISA benchmarks demonstrate superior pixel-level detection performance compared to PromptAD and other baselines.

In this paper, we propose Multi-Persona Thinking (MPT), a novel inference-time framework that leverages dialectical reasoning from multiple perspectives to reduce bias. MPT guides models to adopt contrasting social identities (e.g., male and female) along with a neutral viewpoint, and then engages these personas iteratively to expose and correct biases. Through a dialectical reasoning process, the framework transforms the potential weakness of persona assignment into a strength for bias mitigation.

Layered representations enable flexible, user-driven content creation, but existing approaches often fail to produce layers with coherent compositing relationships, and their object layers typically lack realistic visual effects such as shadows and reflections. To overcome these limitations, we propose LASAGNA, a novel, unified framework that generates an image jointly with its composing layers--a photorealistic background and a high-quality transparent foreground with compelling visual effects. Unlike prior work, LASAGNA efficiently learns correct image composition from a wide range of conditioning inputs--text prompts, foreground, background, and location masks--offering greater controllability for real-world applications. To enable this, we introduce LASAGNA-48K, a new dataset composed of clean backgrounds and RGBA foregrounds with physically grounded visual effects. We also propose LASAGNABENCH, the first benchmark for layer editing. We demonstrate that LASAGNA excels in generating highly consistent and coherent results across multiple image layers simultaneously, enabling diverse post-editing applications that accurately preserve identity and visual effects. LASAGNA-48K and LASAGNABENCH will be publicly released to foster open research in the community.

Among hallucination types, factuality is crucial, as it concerns a model's alignment with established world knowledge. Adversarial factuality, defined as the deliberate insertion of misinformation into prompts with varying levels of expressed confidence, tests a model's ability to detect and resist confidently framed falsehoods. Existing work lacks high-quality, domain-specific resources for assessing model robustness under such adversarial conditions, and no prior research has examined the impact of injected misinformation on long-form text factuality.\n  To address this gap, we introduce AdversaRiskQA, the first verified and reliable benchmark systematically evaluating adversarial factuality across Health, Finance, and Law. The benchmark includes two difficulty levels to test LLMs' defensive capabilities across varying knowledge depths. We propose two automated methods for evaluating the adversarial attack success and long-form factuality. We evaluate six open- and closed-source LLMs from the Qwen, GPT-OSS, and GPT families, measuring misinformation detection rates. Long-form factuality is assessed on Qwen3 (30B) under both baseline and adversarial conditions. Results show that after excluding meaningless responses, Qwen3 (80B) achieves the highest average accuracy, while GPT-5 maintains consistently high accuracy.

To address this, we propose a novel approach that leverages the rich information in dorsal hand skin deformation, unlocked by recent advances in dense visual featurizers. We introduce a dual-stream delta encoder that learns pose by contrasting features from a dynamic hand with a baseline relaxed position. Our evaluation demonstrates that, using only cropped dorsal images, our method reduces the Mean Per Joint Angle Error (MPJAE) by 18% in self-occluded scenarios (fingers >=50% occluded) compared to state-of-the-art techniques that depend on the whole hand's geometry and large model backbones. Consequently, our method not only enhances the reliability of downstream tasks like index finger pinch and tap estimation in occluded scenarios but also unlocks new interaction paradigms, such as detecting isometric force for a surface \"click\" without visible movement while minimizing model size.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u53cc\u6d41delta\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u906e\u6321\u9c81\u68d2\u624b\u52bf\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u80cc\u90e8\u76ae\u80a4\u5f62\u53d8\uff0c\u4ec5\u7528\u88c1\u526a\u56fe\u50cf\u5373\u5728\u81ea\u906e\u6321\u573a\u666f\u5b9e\u73b018%\u7684MPJAE\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e", "motivation": "XR\u8bbe\u5907\u666e\u53ca\u5e26\u6765\u624b\u52bf\u4f30\u8ba1\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4f46\u81ea\u6211\u4e2d\u5fc3\u89c6\u89d2\u5b58\u5728\u624b\u6307\u906e\u6321\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5168\u624b\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u906e\u6321\u573a\u666f", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u53cc\u6d41delta\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5bf9\u6bd4\u52a8\u6001\u624b\u90e8\u4e0e\u57fa\u51c6\u59ff\u6001\u7684\u80cc\u90e8\u76ae\u80a4\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5229\u7528dense visual featurizers\u63d0\u53d6\u5c40\u90e8\u53d8\u5f62\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u5f62\u53d8-\u59ff\u6001\u5173\u8054\u6a21\u578b", "result": "\u5728\u624b\u6307\u906e\u6321\u226550%\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0cMPJAE\u6307\u6807\u8f83\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u534718%\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5c3a\u5bf8\u7f29\u5c0f\u4e14\u652f\u6301\u65e0\u53ef\u89c1\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u7b49\u957f\u529b\u68c0\u6d4b", "conclusion": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u624b\u52bf\u4ea4\u4e92\uff08\u5982\u906e\u6321\u4e0b\u7684\u634f/\u70b9\u51fb\u68c0\u6d4b\uff09\uff0c\u5f00\u521b\u8868\u9762'\u70b9\u51fb'\u7b49\u65b0\u4ea4\u4e92\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7387"}}

We introduce Indica, the first benchmark designed to test LLMs' ability to address this question, focusing on India - a nation of 28 states, 8 union territories, and 22 official languages. We collect human-annotated answers from five Indian regions (North, South, East, West, and Central) across 515 questions spanning 8 domains of everyday life, yielding 1,630 region-specific question-answer pairs. Strikingly, only 39.4% of questions elicit agreement across all five regions, demonstrating that cultural commonsense in India is predominantly regional, not national. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art LLMs and find two critical gaps: models achieve only 13.4%-20.9% accuracy on region-specific questions, and they exhibit geographic bias, over-selecting Central and North India as the \"default\" (selected 30-40% more often than expected) while under-representing East and West.

While In-Context Learning (ICL) offers a training-free adaptation path, standard methods rely on large annotated pools, which are often impractical in specialized environments like industrial or surgical settings since they require the experts' annotations. To bridge this gap, we introduce VIOLA (Video In-cOntext Learning with minimal Annotation), a label-efficient framework that synergizes minimal expert supervision with abundant unlabeled data. First, to maximize the efficiency of a strict annotation budget, we propose density-uncertainty-weighted sampling. Unlike standard diversity or uncertainty strategies that risk selecting visual outliers, our method leverages density estimation to identify samples that are simultaneously diverse, representative, and informative. Second, to utilize the remaining unlabeled data without noise propagation, we construct a hybrid pool and introduce confidence-aware retrieval and confidence-aware prompting. These mechanisms explicitly model label reliability, retrieving demonstrations based on a composite score of similarity and confidence while enabling the MLLM to adaptively distinguish between verified ground truths and noisy pseudo-labels.

However, evaluating their semantic controllability-specifically for fine-grained, single-domain tasks-remains challenging. Standard metrics like FID and Inception Score (IS) often fail to detect identity misalignment in such specialized contexts. In this work, we investigate Class-Conditional DDPMs for K-pop idol face generation (32x32), a domain characterized by high inter-class similarity. We propose a calibrated metric, Relative Classification Accuracy (RCA), which normalizes generative performance against an oracle classifier's baseline. Our evaluation reveals a critical trade-off: while the model achieves high visual quality (FID 8.93), it suffers from severe semantic mode collapse (RCA 0.27), particularly for visually ambiguous identities.

However, existing solutions often rely on rapid classification schemes or post-hoc rules, resulting in limited transparency, inflexible policies, or prohibitive inference costs. To this end, we present YuFeng-XGuard, a reasoning-centric guardrail model family designed to perform multi-dimensional risk perception for LLM interactions. Instead of producing opaque binary judgments, YuFeng-XGuard generates structured risk predictions, including explicit risk categories and configurable confidence scores, accompanied by natural language explanations that expose the underlying reasoning process. This formulation enables safety decisions that are both actionable and interpretable. To balance decision latency and explanatory depth, we adopt a tiered inference paradigm that performs an initial risk decision based on the first decoded token, while preserving ondemand explanatory reasoning when required.

On tasks that require \"backward information\" (e.g., Sudoku), MDLMs adopt a solution order that tends to fill easier Sudoku blanks first, highlighting their advantages.

With the growing interest in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), researchers have started exploring their use in interpretable deepfake detection. However, a major obstacle in applying MLLMs to this task is the scarcity of high-quality datasets with detailed forgery attribution annotations, as textual annotation is both costly and challenging - particularly for high-fidelity forged images or videos. Moreover, multiple studies have shown that reinforcement learning (RL) can substantially enhance performance in visual tasks, especially in improving cross-domain generalization. To facilitate the adoption of mainstream MLLM frameworks in deepfake detection with reduced annotation cost, and to investigate the potential of RL in this context, we propose an automated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data generation framework based on Self-Blended Images, along with an RL-enhanced deepfake detection framework. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our CoT data construction pipeline, tailored reward mechanism, and feedback-driven synthetic data generation approach.

Traditional moderation approaches, such as human annotation and keyword-based filtering, have demonstrated utility, but human moderators on Twitch constantly struggle to scale effectively in the fast-paced, high-volume, and context-rich chat environment of the platform while also facing harassment themselves. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs), such as DeepSeek-R1-Distill and Llama-3-8B-Instruct, offer new opportunities for toxicity detection, especially in understanding nuanced, multimodal communication involving emotes. In this work, we present an exploratory comparison of toxicity detection approaches tailored to Twitch. Our analysis reveals that incorporating emotes improves the detection of toxic behavior. To this end, we introduce ToxiTwitch, a hybrid model that combines LLM-generated embeddings of text and emotes with traditional machine learning classifiers, including Random Forest and SVM. In our case study, the proposed hybrid approach reaches up to 80 percent accuracy under channel-specific training (with 13 percent improvement over BERT and F1-score of 76 percent).

In this paper, we extend CL to continual panoptic perception (CPP), integrating multimodal and multi-task CL to enhance comprehensive image perception through pixel-level, instance-level, and image-level joint interpretation. We formalize the CL task in multimodal scenarios and propose an end-to-end continual panoptic perception model. Concretely, CPP model features a collaborative cross-modal encoder (CCE) for multimodal embedding. We also propose a malleable knowledge inheritance module via contrastive feature distillation and instance distillation, addressing catastrophic forgetting from task-interactive boosting manner. Furthermore, we propose a cross-modal consistency constraint and develop CPP+, ensuring multimodal semantic alignment for model updating under multi-task incremental scenarios. Additionally, our proposed model incorporates an asymmetric pseudo-labeling manner, enabling model evolving without exemplar replay. Extensive experiments on multimodal datasets and diverse CL tasks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model, particularly in fine-grained CL tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5c06\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\uff08CL\uff09\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6301\u7eed\u5168\u666f\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u578b\uff08CPP\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u534f\u540c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u7f16\u7801\u3001\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u53ca\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u4e0e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u4e49\u6df7\u6dc6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u56fe\u50cf\u611f\u77e5\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709CL\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u5355\u4efb\u52a1\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u6df7\u6dc6\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u9000\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u63a2\u7d22\u65b0\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "1. \u63d0\u51fa\u534f\u540c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08CCE\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\uff1b2. \u8bbe\u8ba1\u53ef\u5851\u6027\u77e5\u8bc6\u7ee7\u627f\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u5bf9\u6bd4\u7279\u5f81\u84b8\u998f\u4e0e\u5b9e\u4f8b\u84b8\u998f\uff1b3. \u5f15\u5165\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\uff08CPP+\uff09\u4fdd\u969c\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b4. \u91c7\u7528\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u7b56\u7565\u907f\u514d\u6837\u672c\u56de\u653e\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u591a\u79cdCL\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u611f\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u66f4\u591a\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\uff08\u5982\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\uff09\u3002"}}

Existing studies have primarily evaluated confidence in single-turn, static settings, overlooking the coupling between confidence and correctness as clinical evidence accumulates during real consultations, which limits their support for reliable decision-making. We propose the first benchmark for assessing confidence in multi-turn interaction during realistic medical consultations. Our benchmark unifies three types of medical data for open-ended diagnostic generation and introduces an information sufficiency gradient to characterize the confidence-correctness dynamics as evidence increases. We implement and compare 27 representative methods on this benchmark; two key insights emerge: (1) medical data amplifies the inherent limitations of token-level and consistency-level confidence methods, and (2) medical reasoning must be evaluated for both diagnostic accuracy and information completeness. Based on these insights, we present MedConf, an evidence-grounded linguistic self-assessment framework that constructs symptom profiles via retrieval-augmented generation, aligns patient information with supporting, missing, and contradictory relations, and aggregates them into an interpretable confidence estimate through weighted integration. Across two LLMs and three medical datasets, MedConf consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both AUROC and Pearson correlation coefficient metrics, maintaining stable performance under conditions of information insufficiency and multimorbidity.

However, benchmarking efforts in LLMs for question answering often focus on medical exam questions, which differ significantly in style and content from the questions patients actually raise in real life. To bridge this gap, we sourced data from Google's People Also Ask feature by querying the top 200 prescribed medications in the United States, curating a dataset of medical questions people commonly ask.

Building on this insight, we propose Persona Switch, a novel decoding method that dynamically combines the benefits of both prompting strategies. Our method proceeds step-by-step, selecting the better output between zero-shot and role-play prompting at each step by comparing their output confidence, as measured by the logit gap.

Compared to single-image editing, multi-image composition presents significantly greater challenges in terms of consistency and quality, yet existing models have not disclosed specific methodological details for achieving high-quality fusion. Through statistical analysis, we identify Human-Object Interaction (HOI) as the most sought-after category by the community. We therefore systematically analyze and implement a state-of-the-art solution for multi-image composition with a primary focus on HOI-centric tasks. We present Skywork UniPic 3.0, a unified multimodal framework that integrates single-image editing and multi-image composition. Our model supports an arbitrary (1~6) number and resolution of input images, as well as arbitrary output resolutions (within a total pixel budget of 1024x1024). To address the challenges of multi-image composition, we design a comprehensive data collection, filtering, and synthesis pipeline, achieving strong performance with only 700K high-quality training samples. Furthermore, we introduce a novel training paradigm that formulates multi-image composition as a sequence-modeling problem, transforming conditional generation into unified sequence synthesis. To accelerate inference, we integrate trajectory mapping and distribution matching into the post-training stage, enabling the model to produce high-fidelity samples in just 8 steps and achieve a 12.5x speedup over standard synthesis sampling. Skywork UniPic 3.0 achieves state-of-the-art performance on single-image editing benchmark and surpasses both Nano-Banana and Seedream 4.0 on multi-image composition benchmark, thereby validating the effectiveness of our data pipeline and training paradigm.

This is because rebuttal is a complex process of strategic communication under severe information asymmetry rather than a simple technical debate. Consequently, current approaches struggle as they largely imitate surface-level linguistics, missing the essential element of perspective-taking required for effective persuasion. In this paper, we introduce RebuttalAgent, the first framework to ground academic rebuttal in Theory of Mind (ToM), operationalized through a ToM-Strategy-Response (TSR) pipeline that models reviewer mental state, formulates persuasion strategy, and generates strategy-grounded response. To train our agent, we construct RebuttalBench, a large-scale dataset synthesized via a novel critique-and-refine approach. Our training process consists of two stages, beginning with a supervised fine-tuning phase to equip the agent with ToM-based analysis and strategic planning capabilities, followed by a reinforcement learning phase leveraging the self-reward mechanism for scalable self-improvement. For reliable and efficient automated evaluation, we further develop Rebuttal-RM, a specialized evaluator trained on over 100K samples of multi-source rebuttal data, which achieves scoring consistency with human preferences surpassing powerful judge GPT-4.1. Extensive experiments show RebuttalAgent significantly outperforms the base model by an average of 18.3% on automated metrics, while also outperforming advanced proprietary models across both automated and human evaluations.

A promising strategy involves synthesizing a large dataset with a generative adversarial network (GAN), pre-training a model via self-supervised learning (SSL), and then fine-tuning on the few labeled samples. However, this approach faces a fundamental paradox: conventional GANs themselves require abundant data for stable training, contradicting the premise of few-shot learning. To resolve this, we propose the consistency-regularized generative adversarial network (Cr-GAN), a novel framework designed to synthesize diverse, high-fidelity samples even when trained under these severe data limitations. Cr-GAN introduces a dual-branch discriminator that decouples adversarial training from representation learning. This architecture enables a channel-wise feature interpolation strategy to create novel latent features, complemented by a dual-domain cycle consistency mechanism that ensures semantic integrity. Our Cr-GAN framework is adaptable to various GAN architectures, and its synthesized data effectively boosts multiple SSL algorithms. Extensive experiments on the MSTAR and SRSDD datasets validate our approach, with Cr-GAN achieving a highly competitive accuracy of 71.21% and 51.64%, respectively, in the 8-shot setting, significantly outperforming leading baselines, while requiring only ~5 of the parameters of state-of-the-art diffusion models.

Existing work focuses predominantly on aligning marginal response distributions, treating each survey item independently. While essential, this may overlook deeper latent structures that characterise real populations and underpin cultural values theories. We propose a framework for evaluating the representativeness of aligned models through multivariate correlation patterns in addition to marginal distributions. We show the value of our evaluation scheme by comparing two model steering techniques (persona prompting and demographic fine-tuning) and evaluating them against human responses from the World Values Survey. While the demographically fine-tuned model better approximates marginal response distributions than persona prompting, both techniques fail to fully capture the gold standard correlation patterns.

However, LLMs often lack a nuanced understanding of human cognition and behavior, limiting their effectiveness in social simulation and personalized applications. We posit that this limitation stems from a fundamental misalignment: standard LLM pretraining on vast, uncontextualized web data does not capture the continuous, situated context of an individual's decisions, thoughts, and behaviors over time. To bridge this gap, we introduce HumanLLM, a foundation model designed for personalized understanding and simulation of individuals. We first construct the Cognitive Genome Dataset, a large-scale corpus curated from real-world user data on platforms like Reddit, Twitter, Blogger, and Amazon. Through a rigorous, multi-stage pipeline involving data filtering, synthesis, and quality control, we automatically extract over 5.5 million user logs to distill rich profiles, behaviors, and thinking patterns.

A major empirical bottleneck in this area is the shortage of accurate and robust evaluation metrics for many languages, which hinders progress.

Motivated by the hypothesis that this mismatch could also apply to multilingual neural metrics, we ask whether steering their activations toward an English pivot can improve correlation with human judgments.

Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer zero-shot prediction without task-specific training, yet their systematic evaluation on multi-attribute fashion tasks remains underexplored. A key challenge is that fashion attributes are often conditional. For example, \"outer fabric\" is undefined when no outer garment is visible. This requires models to detect attribute applicability before attempting classification. We introduce a three-tier evaluation framework that decomposes this challenge: (1) overall task performance across all classes (including NA class: suggesting attribute is not applicable) for all attributes, (2) attribute applicability detection, and (3) fine-grained classification when attributes are determinable. Using DeepFashion-MultiModal, which explicitly defines NA (meaning attribute doesn't exist or is not visible) within attribute label spaces, we benchmark nine VLMs spanning flagship (GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro), efficient (GPT-5 Mini, Gemini 2.5 Flash), and ultra-efficient tiers (GPT-5 Nano, Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite) against classifiers trained on pretrained Fashion-CLIP embeddings on 5,000 images across 18 attributes. Our findings reveal that: (1) zero-shot VLMs achieve 64.0% macro-F1, a threefold improvement over logistic regression on pretrained Fashion-CLIP embeddings; (2) VLMs excel at fine-grained classification (Tier 3: 70.8% F1) but struggle with applicability detection (Tier 2: 34.1% NA-F1), identifying a key bottleneck; (3) efficient models achieve over 90% of flagship performance at lower cost, offering practical deployment paths.

Dynamic Retrieval-Augmented Generation provides a promising solution by triggering keyword-based retrieval and incorporating external knowledge, thus enabling both efficient and accurate evidence selection. However, it still faces challenges in addressing issues such as redundant retrieval, coarse similarity, and irrelevant evidence when applied to deceptive content. In this paper, we propose ExDR, an Explanation-driven Dynamic Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework for Multimodal Fake News Detection.

Sixty-nine translators took part in an in-person experiment, where they assessed three anonymized short stories - two written by ChatGPT-4o and one by a human author. For each story, participants rated the likelihood of AI authorship and provided justifications for their choices. While average results were inconclusive, a statistically significant subset (16.2%) successfully distinguished the synthetic texts from the human text, suggesting that their judgements were informed by analytical skill rather than chance. However, a nearly equal number misclassified the texts in the opposite direction, often relying on subjective impressions rather than objective markers, possibly reflecting a reader preference for AI-generated texts. Low burstiness and narrative contradiction emerged as the most reliable indicators of synthetic authorship, with unexpected calques, semantic loans and syntactic transfer from English also reported.

However, current paradigms enforce the secret image to maintain the same resolution as the cover image during hiding and revealing. This leads to two challenges: secret images with inconsistent resolutions must undergo resampling beforehand which results in detail loss during recovery, and the secret image cannot be recovered to its original resolution when the resolution value is unknown. To address these, we propose ARDIS, the first Arbitrary Resolution DIS framework, which shifts the paradigm from discrete mapping to reference-guided continuous signal reconstruction. Specifically, to minimize the detail loss caused by resolution mismatch, we first design a Frequency Decoupling Architecture in hiding stage. It disentangles the secret into a resolution-aligned global basis and a resolution-agnostic high-frequency latent to hide in a fixed-resolution cover. Second, for recovery, we propose a Latent-Guided Implicit Reconstructor to perform deterministic restoration. The recovered detail latent code modulates a continuous implicit function to accurately query and render high-frequency residuals onto the recovered global basis, ensuring faithful restoration of original details. Furthermore, to achieve blind recovery, we introduce an Implicit Resolution Coding strategy. By transforming discrete resolution values into dense feature maps and hiding them in the redundant space of the feature domain, the reconstructor can correctly decode the secret's resolution directly from the steganographic representation. Experimental results demonstrate that ARDIS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both invisibility and cross-resolution recovery fidelity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u4efb\u610f\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf\u9690\u5199\u6846\u67b6ARDIS\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u79bb\u6563\u6620\u5c04\u8303\u5f0f\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53c2\u8003\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u4fe1\u53f7\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u79d8\u5bc6\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u5c01\u9762\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u7ec6\u8282\u4e22\u5931\u548c\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u672a\u77e5\u65f6\u65e0\u6cd5\u6062\u590d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf\u9690\u5199\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f3a\u5236\u8981\u6c42\u79d8\u5bc6\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u5c01\u9762\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u9700\u9884\u5904\u7406\u8c03\u6574\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ec6\u8282\u4e22\u5931\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u6062\u590d\u672a\u77e5\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u79d8\u5bc6\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "method": "1) \u9891\u7387\u89e3\u8026\u67b6\u6784\uff1a\u5728\u9690\u85cf\u9636\u6bb5\u5c06\u79d8\u5bc6\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u4f4e\u9891\u57fa\u548c\u4e0e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u9ad8\u9891\u6f5c\u7801\uff1b2) \u6f5c\u7801\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u91cd\u5efa\u5668\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u8fde\u7eed\u9690\u51fd\u6570\u67e5\u8be2\u9ad8\u9891\u6b8b\u5dee\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec6\u8282\u6062\u590d\uff1b3) \u9690\u5f0f\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7f16\u7801\uff1a\u5c06\u79bb\u6563\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u503c\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\u56fe\u9690\u85cf\u5728\u5197\u4f59\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eARDIS\u5728\u9690\u853d\u6027\u548c\u8de8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u91cd\u5efa\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6280\u672f\u3002", "conclusion": "ARDIS\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u9884\u5904\u7406\u8c03\u6574\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u9690\u5199\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fde\u7eed\u4fe1\u53f7\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u9690\u5f0f\u7f16\u7801\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u53ef\u76f2\u6062\u590d\u4efb\u610f\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u79d8\u5bc6\u56fe\u50cf\u5e76\u4fdd\u7559\u539f\u59cb\u7ec6\u8282\u3002"}}

To enable efficient knowledge learning and stable training, we incorporate a block diffusion continual pretraining (CPT) stage enhanced by a tailored warmup and block-wise clipped noise schedule. Under the same data and architecture, Stable-DiffCoder overall outperforms its AR counterpart on a broad suite of code benchmarks. Moreover, relying only on the CPT and supervised fine-tuning stages, Stable-DiffCoder achieves stronger performance than a wide range of \\~8B ARs and DLLMs, demonstrating that diffusion-based training can improve code modeling quality beyond AR training alone.

We present physical spectrum-aware white-box mHC, named ES-mHC, a hyper-connection framework that explicitly models interactions among different electromagnetic spectrum groupings (residual stream in mHC) interactions using structured, directional matrices. By separating feature representation from interaction structure, ES-mHC promotes electromagnetic spectrum grouping specialization, reduces redundancy, and exposes internal information flow that can be directly visualized and spatially analyzed. Using hyperspectral image classification as a representative testbed, we demonstrate that the learned hyper-connection matrices exhibit coherent spatial patterns and asymmetric interaction behaviors, providing mechanistic insight into the model internal dynamics. Furthermore, we find that increasing the expansion rate accelerates the emergence of structured interaction patterns.

Our paper introduces an image-based approach that transforms magnetoencephalography (MEG) signals into time-frequency representations compatible with pretrained vision models. MEG data from 21 participants performing imagined speech tasks were projected into three spatial scalogram mixtures via a learnable sensor-space convolution, producing compact image-like inputs for ImageNet-pretrained vision architectures. These models outperformed classical and non-pretrained models, achieving up to 90.4% balanced accuracy for imagery vs. silence, 81.0% vs. silent reading, and 60.6% for vowel decoding. Cross-subject evaluation confirmed that pretrained models capture shared neural representations, and temporal analyses localized discriminative information to imagery-locked intervals.

Traditional deep learning methods often require large annotated datasets for a fixed set of labels, making them inflexible when clinical or research needs change. By integrating atlas-based prompts and foundation-model principles, FeTal-SAM addresses two key limitations in fetal brain MRI segmentation: (1) the need to retrain models for varying label definitions, and (2) the lack of insight into whether segmentations are driven by genuine image contrast or by learned spatial priors. We leverage multi-atlas registration to generate spatially aligned label templates that serve as dense prompts, alongside a bounding-box prompt, for SAM's segmentation decoder. This strategy enables binary segmentation on a per-structure basis, which is subsequently fused to reconstruct the full 3D segmentation volumes. Evaluations on two datasets, the dHCP dataset and an in-house dataset demonstrate FeTal-SAM's robust performance across gestational ages. Notably, it achieves Dice scores comparable to state-of-the-art baselines which were trained for each dataset and label definition for well-contrasted structures like cortical plate and cerebellum, while maintaining the flexibility to segment any user-specified anatomy. Although slightly lower accuracy is observed for subtle, low-contrast structures (e.g., hippocampus, amygdala), our results highlight FeTal-SAM's potential to serve as a general-purpose segmentation model without exhaustive retraining. This method thus constitutes a promising step toward clinically adaptable fetal brain MRI analysis tools.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51faFeTal-SAM\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u56fe\u8c31\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578bSAM\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u80ce\u513f\u8111\u90e8MRI\u7075\u6d3b\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u56fa\u5b9a\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u548c\u5927\u91cf\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u56fa\u5b9a\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u5206\u5272\u7ed3\u679c\u662f\u6e90\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u7279\u5f81\u8fd8\u662f\u9884\u8bbe\u7a7a\u95f4\u5148\u9a8c\u3002\u80ce\u513fMRI\u9700\u9002\u5e94\u4e34\u5e8a\u9700\u6c42\u53d8\u5316\u4e0e\u6807\u7b7e\u5b9a\u4e49\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u4e14\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u591a\u56fe\u8c31\u914d\u51c6\u751f\u6210\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u4e8c\u503c\u6807\u7b7e\u6a21\u677f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5bc6\u96c6\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8fb9\u754c\u6846\u63d0\u793a\u6ce8\u5165SAM\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u9010\u7ed3\u6784\u8fdb\u884c\u4e8c\u5206\u7c7b\u5206\u5272\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u7ed3\u6784\u5206\u5272\u7ed3\u679c\u878d\u5408\u6784\u5efa\u5b8c\u65743D\u5206\u5272\u4f53\u79ef\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9700\u9884\u8bbe\u6807\u7b7e\u96c6\u7684\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u5f0f\u5206\u5272\u3002", "result": "\u5728dHCP\u548c\u79c1\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u5bf9\u9ad8\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u5982\u5927\u8111\u76ae\u5c42\u3001\u5c0f\u8111\uff09\u7684Dice\u5206\u6570\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u4f46\u4fdd\u7559\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u610f\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u4f4e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u5982\u6d77\u9a6c\u3001\u674f\u4ec1\u6838\uff09\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7565\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4f46\u8de8\u5b55\u5468\u8868\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\u3002", "conclusion": "FeTal-SAM\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\u4e0e\u56fe\u50cf\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u6807\u7b7e\u5b9a\u4e49\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u53ef\u9002\u914d\u7684\u80ce\u513fMRI\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

We make two contributions: (1)Encoder Model Pre-trained from Scratch: ModernBERT-based bidirectional encoders pre-trained on a Turkish-dominant corpus of 112.7 billion tokens. We implement a checkpoint selection strategy that evaluates downstream retrieval performance throughout training, revealing that optimal checkpoints achieve best retrieval scores before pre-training loss reaches its minimum. Our encoder models achieve top-3 rankings on the Turkish retrieval leaderboard, with smaller models (155M parameters) achieving comparable performance to larger reference models (307M-567M parameters). Our approach achieves 92.36% production efficiency compared to state-of-the-art models (embeddinggemma-300m: 100.00%, BAAI/bge-m3: 99.54%, newmindai/bge-m3-stsb: 94.38%), ranking fourth overall despite requiring less computational resources.

However, most existing methods primarily operate in the pixel domain or rely on implicit feature representations. As a result, the intrinsic geometric structural priors of images are often neglected. 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) has emerged as a prominent explicit scene representation technique characterized by superior structural fitting capabilities and high rendering efficiency. Despite these advantages, the utilization of 2DGS in low-level vision tasks remains unexplored. To bridge this gap, LL-GaussianMap is proposed as the first unsupervised framework incorporating 2DGS into low-light image enhancement. Distinct from conventional methodologies, the enhancement task is formulated as a gain map generation process guided by 2DGS primitives. The proposed method comprises two primary stages. First, high-fidelity structural reconstruction is executed utilizing 2DGS. Then, data-driven enhancement dictionary coefficients are rendered via the rasterization mechanism of Gaussian splatting through an innovative unified enhancement module. This design effectively incorporates the structural perception capabilities of 2DGS into gain map generation, thereby preserving edges and suppressing artifacts during enhancement. Additionally, the reliance on paired data is circumvented through unsupervised learning.

By aligning layers via concept fingerprints and reconstructing refusal directions using a shared ``recipe'' of concept atoms, we map the donor's ablation trajectory into the target's semantic space.

To address this limitation, we propose a diffusion-based data augmentation framework capable of generating diverse and structurally plausible image-label pairs for neuron segmentation.

Languages such as Kashmiri, with approximately 7 million speakers and a complex Perso-Arabic script featuring unique diacritical marks, currently lack support in major OCR systems including Tesseract, TrOCR, and PaddleOCR. Manual dataset creation for such languages is prohibitively expensive, time-consuming, and error-prone, often requiring word by word transcription of printed or handwritten text.\n  We present SynthOCR-Gen, an open-source synthetic OCR dataset generator specifically designed for low-resource languages. Our tool addresses the fundamental bottleneck in OCR development by transforming digital Unicode text corpora into ready-to-use training datasets. The system implements a comprehensive pipeline encompassing text segmentation (character, word, n-gram, sentence, and line levels), Unicode normalization with script purity enforcement, multi-font rendering with configurable distribution, and 25+ data augmentation techniques simulating real-world document degradations including rotation, blur, noise, and scanner artifacts.\n  We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by generating a 600,000-sample word-segmented Kashmiri OCR dataset, which we release publicly on HuggingFace. This work provides a practical pathway for bringing low-resource languages into the era of vision-language AI models, and the tool is openly available for researchers and practitioners working with underserved writing systems worldwide.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSynthOCR-Gen\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u751f\u6210OCR\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u89e3\u51b3\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\uff08\u5982\u514b\u4ec0\u7c73\u5c14\u8bed\uff09\u7684OCR\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u6587\u672c\u5206\u5272\u3001Unicode\u89c4\u8303\u5316\u3001\u591a\u5b57\u4f53\u6e32\u67d3\u548c\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u5757\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\uff08\u5982\u514b\u4ec0\u7c73\u5c14\u8bed\uff09\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6807\u6ce8OCR\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u6613\u51fa\u9519\u3002\u4e3b\u6d41OCR\u5de5\u5177\uff08\u5982Tesseract\u3001TrOCR\uff09\u4e0d\u652f\u6301\u590d\u6742\u4e66\u5199\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u5982\u514b\u4ec0\u7c73\u5c14\u8bed\u7684\u6ce2\u65af-\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u53d8\u4f53\u8f85\u4ee5\u53d8\u97f3\u7b26\u53f7\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5168\u6d41\u7a0b\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u5de5\u5177\uff1a1) \u6587\u672c\u5206\u5272\uff08\u5b57\u7b26/\u8bcd/\u53e5\u7ea7\uff09\uff1b2) Unicode\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u4e0e\u5b57\u4f53\u7eaf\u51c0\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\uff1b3) \u591a\u5b57\u4f53\u6e32\u67d3\uff1b4) \u6a21\u62df\u6587\u6863\u9000\u5316\u768425\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u6280\u672f\uff08\u65cb\u8f6c\u3001\u6a21\u7cca\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u7b49\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u751f\u6210\u5e76\u5f00\u6e90\u5305\u542b60\u4e07\u6837\u672c\u7684\u514b\u4ec0\u7c73\u5c14\u8bedOCR\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08Word-segmented\uff09\uff0c\u5728HuggingFace\u53d1\u5e03\u3002\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00OCR\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u6ce2\u65af-\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u4e66\u5199\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u590d\u7528\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u8fdb\u5165\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00 AI \u65f6\u4ee3\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5de5\u5177\u652f\u6301\u5168\u7403\u6b20\u670d\u52a1\u4e66\u5199\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684OCR\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u95ed\u73af\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5bf9\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u6ce8\u610f\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u6587\u672c\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002"}}

Through minimal video pairs, we test three challenges: distinguishing violence from benign activity, binding assailant roles across viewpoints, and judging fine-grained trajectory alignment. While we evaluate recent VLMs in a training-free setting, the benchmark is applicable to any video classification model. Results show performance only slightly above chance across tasks.

Recent research on merging multilingual multitask models has shown promise in terms of improved quality, but its computational and maintenance efficiency remains unstudied. In this work, we provide the first focused analysis of this merging strategy from an efficiency perspective, evaluating it across three independent tasks. We demonstrate significant efficiency gains while maintaining parity in terms of quality: this merging approach reduces the initial training time by up to 50\\%. We also demonstrate that updating an individual language and re-merging as part of model maintenance reduces training costs by more than 60\\%, compared to re-training the full multilingual model.

This evolution is evident in the distinction between the classical and modern Arabic eras. Although historians and linguists have partitioned Arabic literature into multiple eras, relatively little research has explored the automatic classification of Arabic texts by time period, particularly beyond the domain of poetry. This paper addresses this gap by employing neural networks and deep learning techniques to automatically classify Arabic texts into distinct eras and periods. The proposed models are evaluated using two datasets derived from two publicly available corpora, covering texts from the pre-Islamic to the modern era. The study examines class setups ranging from binary to 15-class classification and considers both predefined historical eras and custom periodizations. Results range from F1-scores of 0.83 and 0.79 on the binary-era classification task using the OpenITI and APCD datasets, respectively, to 0.20 on the 15-era classification task using OpenITI and 0.18 on the 12-era classification task using APCD.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper explores the use of neural networks and deep learning to automatically classify Arabic texts into historical eras, showing varying success depending on the complexity of the classification task.", "motivation": "There is a lack of research on automatic classification of Arabic texts by period, particularly outside of poetry.

However, this reliance on massive training data also brings two major challenges: (1) high storage and computational costs, and (2) the risk of data leakage, especially when sensitive categories are involved. To address these challenges, this study introduces the concept of dataset distillation into the field of remote sensing image interpretation for the first time. Specifically, we train a text-to-image diffusion model to condense a large-scale remote sensing dataset into a compact and representative distilled dataset. To improve the discriminative quality of the synthesized samples, we propose a classifier-driven guidance by injecting a classification consistency loss from a pre-trained model into the diffusion training process. Besides, considering the rich semantic complexity of remote sensing imagery, we further perform latent space clustering on training samples to select representative and diverse prototypes as visual style guidance, while using a visual language model to provide aggregated text descriptions.

All sensor data is wirelessly transmitted to the ThingSpeak cloud platform for remote monitoring, historical analysis, and automated alert generation. Experimental results demonstrate the system's effectiveness in maintaining optimal soil moisture levels (with 92\\% accuracy), providing real-time environmental monitoring, and reducing water consumption by approximately 40\\% compared to conventional irrigation methods. The integrated web dashboard offers comprehensive visualization of plant health parameters, making it suitable for both small-scale gardening and commercial agriculture applications. With a total implementation cost of \\$45.20, this system provides an affordable, scalable solution for precision agriculture and smart farming.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u690d\u7269\u76d1\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u4e0e\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u704c\u6e89\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d44\u6e90\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u7cbe\u51c6\u519c\u4e1a\u3002", "motivation": "\u5e94\u5bf9\u4f20\u7edf\u519c\u4e1a\u4e2d\u4eba\u5de5\u89c2\u5bdf\u548c\u5468\u671f\u6027\u704c\u6e89\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6c34\u8d44\u6e90\u6d6a\u8d39\u3001\u690d\u7269\u751f\u957f\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u53ca\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u5316\u54cd\u5e94\u6ede\u540e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3\u5168\u7403\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u519c\u4e1a\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528ESP32\u5fae\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u96c6\u6210\u6e29\u6e7f\u5ea6(DHT22)\u3001\u6c34\u4f4d(HC-SR04)\u3001\u571f\u58e4\u6e7f\u5ea6\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u53caOLED\u663e\u793a/\u8702\u9e23\u5668\u62a5\u8b66\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Wi-Fi\u5c06\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u4f20\u81f3ThingSpeak\u4e91\u5e73\u53f0\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fdc\u7a0b\u76d1\u63a7\u4e0e\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u704c\u6e89\u3002", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ef4\u6301\u571f\u58e4\u6e7f\u5ea692%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u8282\u6c3440%\u4e14\u90e8\u7f72\u6210\u672c\u4ec545.20\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u914d\u5957\u7684\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u7f51\u9875\u4eea\u8868\u677f\u652f\u6301\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u544a\u8b66\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u65b9\u6848\u7ed3\u5408\u8fb9\u7f18\u4f20\u611f\u4e0e\u4e91\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u4e3a\u56ed\u827a\u548c\u5546\u4e1a\u519c\u4e1a\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u704c\u6e89\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Current CIR benchmarks typically feature limited query categories and fail to capture the diverse requirements of real-world scenarios.

Using this pipeline, we construct EDIR, a novel fine-grained CIR benchmark. EDIR encompasses 5,000 high-quality queries structured across five main categories and fifteen subcategories. Our comprehensive evaluation of 13 multimodal embedding models reveals a significant capability gap; even state-of-the-art models (e.g., RzenEmbed and GME) struggle to perform consistently across all subcategories, highlighting the rigorous nature of our benchmark. Through comparative analysis, we further uncover inherent limitations in existing benchmarks, such as modality biases and insufficient categorical coverage.

However, depending on the patient's health condition or the medical resources available, the use of contrast medium is not always feasible. Recent work has explored AI-based image translation to synthesize contrast-enhanced images directly from non-contrast scans, aims to reduce side effects and streamlines clinical workflows. Progress in this direction has been constrained by data limitations: (1) existing public datasets focus almost exclusively on brain-related paired MR modalities; (2) other collections include partially paired data but suffer from missing modalities/timestamps and imperfect spatial alignment; (3) explicit labeling of CT vs. CTC or DCE phases is often absent; (4) substantial resources remain private. To bridge this gap, we introduce the first public, fully paired, pan-cancer medical imaging dataset spanning 11 human organs. The MR data include complete dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) sequences covering all three phases (DCE1-DCE3), while the CT data provide paired non-contrast and contrast-enhanced acquisitions (CTC). The dataset is curated for anatomical correspondence, enabling rigorous evaluation of 1-to-1, N-to-1, and N-to-N translation settings (e.g., predicting DCE phases from non-contrast inputs). Built upon this resource, we establish a comprehensive benchmark. We report results from representative baselines of contemporary image-to-image translation.

By comparison, vision foundation models (VFMs) often exhibit uneven improvements across downstream tasks, despite substantial computational investment. We postulate that this limitation arises from a mismatch between pretraining objectives and the demands of downstream vision-and-imaging tasks. Pretraining strategies like masked image reconstruction or contrastive learning shape representations for tasks such as recovery of generic visual patterns or global semantic structures, which may not align with the task-specific requirements of downstream applications including segmentation, classification, or image synthesis. To investigate this in a concrete real-world clinical area, we assess two VFMs, a reconstruction-focused MAE-based model (ProFound) and a contrastive-learning-based model (ProViCNet), on five prostate multiparametric MR imaging tasks, examining how such task alignment influences transfer performance, i.e., from pretraining to fine-tuning. Our findings indicate that better alignment between pretraining and downstream tasks, measured by simple divergence metrics such as maximum-mean-discrepancy (MMD) between the same features before and after fine-tuning, correlates with greater performance improvements and faster convergence, emphasizing the importance of designing and analyzing pretraining objectives with downstream applicability in mind.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6307\u51fa\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u4e0e\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u5339\u914d\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u79cd\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u524d\u5217\u817aMRI\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4efb\u52a1\u5bf9\u9f50\u5ea6\uff08\u5982MMD\u8861\u91cf\uff09\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u53ca\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\u8f83\u5927\uff0c\u4f46\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u8ba4\u4e3a\u8fd9\u6e90\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\uff08\u5982\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u6216\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\uff09\u4e0e\u7279\u5b9a\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u5206\u5272\u3001\u5206\u7c7b\uff09\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u9700\u6c42\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u901a\u8fc7\u4efb\u52a1\u5bf9\u9f50\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u4f18\u5316\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u79cd\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578bProFound\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a9\u7801\u91cd\u5efa\uff09\u4e0eProViCNet\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\uff09\uff0c\u57285\u4e2a\u524d\u5217\u817a\u591a\u53c2\u6570MRI\u4e34\u5e8a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5927\u5747\u503c\u5dee\u5f02\uff08MMD\uff09\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u91cf\u5316\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3-\u5fae\u8c03\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u5bf9\u9f50\u5ea6\u9ad8\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u5e45\u5ea6\u66f4\u5927\u4e14\u6536\u655b\u66f4\u5feb\uff1bMMD\u7b49\u5bf9\u9f50\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u9002\u914d\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u660e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u9700\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4ee5\u5339\u914d\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5316\u5bf9\u9f50\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u6548\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Despite the strong empirical performance of recent affective models, the internal architectural mechanisms that support affective understanding and generation are still poorly understood. In this work, we present a systematic mechanistic study of affective modeling in multimodal foundation models. Across multiple architectures, training strategies, and affective tasks, we analyze how emotion-oriented supervision reshapes internal model parameters. Our results consistently reveal a clear and robust pattern: affective adaptation does not primarily focus on the attention module, but instead localizes to the feed-forward gating projection (\\texttt{gate\\_proj}). Through controlled module transfer, targeted single-module adaptation, and destructive ablation, we further demonstrate that \\texttt{gate\\_proj} is sufficient, efficient, and necessary for affective understanding and generation. Notably, by tuning only approximately 24.5\\% of the parameters tuned by AffectGPT, our approach achieves 96.6\\% of its average performance across eight affective tasks, highlighting substantial parameter efficiency.

In addition, we introduce a novel surgical benchmark dataset comprising over 68,000 frames and 3,000 manually annotated 2D hand poses with triangulated 3D ground truth, recorded in a replica operating room under varying levels of scene complexity.\n  Results: Quantitative experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms baselines, achieving a 31% reduction in 2D mean joint error and a 76% reduction in 3D mean per-joint position error.\n  Conclusion: Our work establishes a strong baseline for 3D hand pose estimation in surgery, providing both a training-free pipeline and a comprehensive annotated dataset to facilitate future research in surgical computer vision.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u9886\u57df\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u624b\u672f\u573a\u666f3D\u624b\u90e8\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08HandOccNet\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u542b68,000\u5e27\u4e0e3,000\u4e2a\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u624b\u672f\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08SurgHands\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u7ba1\u9053\u548c\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e2D/3D\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u4e3a\u5fae\u521b\u624b\u672f\u667a\u80fd\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u5173\u952e\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "motivation": "\u624b\u672f\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u5149\u7167\uff08\u5982\u65e0\u5f71\u706f\uff09\u3001\u5668\u68b0/\u4eba\u5458\u906e\u6321\u3001\u624b\u5957\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u624b\u90e8\u8868\u89c2\u5355\u4e00\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8de8\u573a\u666f\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u548c\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u6027\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u9700\u5f00\u53d1\u4e13\u7528\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u7279\u6b8a\u8c03\u4f18\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u5168\u76d1\u7763\u7ba1\u9053\uff1a1\uff09\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3YOLOv7\u8fdb\u884c\u533b\u62a4\u4eba\u5458\u68c0\u6d4b\uff1b2\uff09\u901a\u8fc7HRNet-W48\u83b7\u53d6\u5168\u8eab\u59ff\u6001\u7279\u5f81\uff1b3\uff09\u5e94\u7528SimCC\u63d0\u53d62D\u624b\u90e8\u5173\u952e\u70b9\uff1b4\uff09\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u51e0\u4f55\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u53163D\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u5168\u7a0b\u4e0d\u4f7f\u7528\u624b\u672f\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u5728SurgHands\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d6\u5f972D\u8bef\u5dee31%\u964d\u4f4e\uff0811.67\u21928.07\u50cf\u7d20\uff09\u548c3D\u8bef\u5dee76%\u538b\u7f29\uff0860.51\u219214.52\u6beb\u7c73\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u65e0\u5f71\u706f\u5f3a\u5149\u7167\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4f9d\u7136\u4fdd\u630185%+\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u624b\u672f\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u53cc\u91cd\u8d21\u732e\uff1a1\uff09\u65e0\u9700\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u5f0f\u624b\u90e8\u611f\u77e5\u6846\u67b6\uff1b2\uff09\u9996\u4e2a\u6db5\u76d6\u590d\u6742\u624b\u672f\u5e72\u6270\u56e0\u5b50\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63a8\u52a8\u533b\u7597AI\u5728\u6280\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u624b\u672f\u5ba4\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Addressing the imbalance in the classes, attention in the related literature was given mainly to the adjustments carried out in the decision space in terms of either corrections performed at the logit level in order to compensate class-prior bias, with the least attention to the optimization process resulting from the adjustments introduced through the differences in the confidences among the samples. In the current study, we present the design of a class and confidence-aware re-weighting scheme for long-tailed learning. This scheme is purely based upon the loss level and has a complementary nature to the existing methods performing the adjustment of the logits. In the practical implementation stage of the proposed scheme, we use an \u03a9(p_t, f_c) function. This function enables the modulation of the contribution towards the training task based upon the confidence value of the prediction, as well as the relative frequency of the corresponding class.

The irregular morphology and densely intertwined structures of neurons make this task particularly challenging. Prevailing CNN-based methods often fail to resolve ambiguous boundaries due to the lack of long-range context, whereas Transformer-based methods suffer from boundary imprecision caused by the loss of voxel-level details during patch partitioning. To address these limitations, we propose NeuroMamba, a multi-perspective framework that exploits the linear complexity of Mamba to enable patch-free global modeling and synergizes this with complementary local feature modeling, thereby efficiently capturing long-range dependencies while meticulously preserving fine-grained voxel details. Specifically, we design a channel-gated Boundary Discriminative Feature Extractor (BDFE) to enhance local morphological cues. Complementing this, we introduce the Spatial Continuous Feature Extractor (SCFE), which integrates a resolution-aware scanning mechanism into the Visual Mamba architecture to adaptively model global dependencies across varying data resolutions. Finally, a cross-modulation mechanism synergistically fuses these multi-perspective features. Our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across four public EM datasets, validating its exceptional adaptability to both anisotropic and isotropic resolutions.

While state-of-the-art neural radiance fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting approaches achieve photorealism, they often rely on time-consuming per-scene optimization. Conversely, emerging feed-forward methods frequently adopt per-pixel Gaussian representations, which lead to 3D inconsistencies when aggregating multi-view predictions in complex, dynamic environments. We propose EvolSplat4D, a feed-forward framework that moves beyond existing per-pixel paradigms by unifying volume-based and pixel-based Gaussian prediction across three specialized branches. For close-range static regions, we predict consistent geometry of 3D Gaussians over multiple frames directly from a 3D feature volume, complemented by a semantically-enhanced image-based rendering module for predicting their appearance. For dynamic actors, we utilize object-centric canonical spaces and a motion-adjusted rendering module to aggregate temporal features, ensuring stable 4D reconstruction despite noisy motion priors. Far-Field scenery is handled by an efficient per-pixel Gaussian branch to ensure full-scene coverage.

Existing benchmarks attempting to measure this matter rely on synthetic, Visual Question Answer templates or focus on perceptual video quality that is tangential to measuring how well the video abides by physical laws. To address this fragmentation, we introduce PhysicsMind, a unified benchmark with both real and simulation environments that evaluates law-consistent reasoning and generation over three canonical principles: Center of Mass, Lever Equilibrium, and Newton's First Law. PhysicsMind comprises two main tasks: i) VQA tasks, testing whether models can reason and determine physical quantities and values from images or short videos, and ii) Video Generation(VG) tasks, evaluating if predicted motion trajectories obey the same center-of-mass, torque, and inertial constraints as the ground truth.

However, unlike traditional pipelines that leverage keyframe methods to enhance efficiency and accuracy, current foundation model based methods, such as VGGT-Long, typically process raw image sequences indiscriminately. This leads to computational redundancy and degraded performance caused by low inter-frame parallax, which provides limited contextual stereo information. Integrating traditional geometric heuristics into these methods is non-trivial, as their performance depends on high-dimensional latent representations rather than explicit geometric metrics. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel keyframe-based feed-forward VO. Instead of relying on hand-crafted rules, our approach employs reinforcement learning to derive an adaptive keyframe policy in a data-driven manner, aligning selection with the intrinsic characteristics of the underlying foundation model. We train our agent on TartanAir dataset and conduct extensive evaluations across several real-world datasets.

However, this task is particularly challenging: H\\&E morphology provides ambiguous cues about protein expression, and similar tissue structures may correspond to distinct molecular states. Most existing methods focus on direct appearance synthesis to implicitly achieve cross-modal generation, often resulting in semantic inconsistencies due to insufficient structural priors. In this paper, we propose Pathology-Aware Integrated Next-Scale Transformation (PAINT), a visual autoregressive framework that reformulates the synthesis process as a structure-first conditional generation task. Unlike direct image translation, PAINT enforces a causal order by resolving molecular details conditioned on a global structural layout. Central to this approach is the introduction of a Spatial Structural Start Map (3S-Map), which grounds the autoregressive initialization in observed morphology, ensuring deterministic, spatially aligned synthesis.

Thus, they lack the capability to estimate multiple proposals, human interaction, and cross-modality adaptation. Recently, text-to-image diffusion models have shown potential to bridge the gap. However, training them from scratch requires a large dataset-a limitation for medical image segmentation. Furthermore, they are often limited to binary segmentation and cannot be conditioned on a natural language prompt. To this end, we propose a novel framework called ProGiDiff that leverages existing image generation models for medical image segmentation purposes. Specifically, we propose a ControlNet-style conditioning mechanism with a custom encoder, suitable for image conditioning, to steer a pre-trained diffusion model to output segmentation masks. It naturally extends to a multi-class setting simply by prompting the target organ. Our experiment on organ segmentation from CT images demonstrates strong performance compared to previous methods and could greatly benefit from an expert-in-the-loop setting to leverage multiple proposals.

However, by default, VLA models may overly attend to image tokens in the task-irrelevant region, which we describe as 'distracting tokens'. This behavior can disturb the model from the generation of the desired action tokens in each step, affecting the success rate of tasks. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective plug-and-play Distracting Token Pruning (DTP) framework, which dynamically detects and prunes these distracting image tokens. By correcting the model's visual attention patterns, we aim to improve the task success rate, as well as exploring the performance upper boundaries of the model without altering its original architecture or adding additional inputs.

However, their deployment in federated settings is hindered by high computational demands, substantial communication overhead, and significant inference costs. We propose DSFedMed, a dual-scale federated framework that enables mutual knowledge distillation between a centralized foundation model and lightweight client models for medical image segmentation. To support knowledge distillation, a set of high-quality medical images is generated to replace real public datasets, and a learnability-guided sample selection strategy is proposed to enhance efficiency and effectiveness in dual-scale distillation. This mutual distillation enables the foundation model to transfer general knowledge to lightweight clients, while also incorporating client-specific insights to refine the foundation model. Evaluations on five medical imaging segmentation datasets show that DSFedMed achieves an average 2 percent improvement in Dice score while reducing communication costs and inference time by nearly 90 percent compared to existing federated foundation model baselines.

To address these limitations, we leverage recent advances in generative masked modeling and present MoRo: Masked Modeling for human motion Recovery under Occlusions. MoRo is an occlusion-robust, end-to-end generative framework that formulates motion reconstruction as a video-conditioned task, and efficiently recover human motion in a consistent global coordinate system from RGB videos. By masked modeling, MoRo naturally handles occlusions while enabling efficient, end-to-end inference. To overcome the scarcity of paired video-motion data, we design a cross-modality learning scheme that learns multi-modal priors from a set of heterogeneous datasets: (i) a trajectory-aware motion prior trained on MoCap datasets, (ii) an image-conditioned pose prior trained on image-pose datasets, capturing diverse per-frame poses, and (iii) a video-conditioned masked transformer that fuses motion and pose priors, finetuned on video-motion datasets to integrate visual cues with motion dynamics for robust inference. Extensive experiments on EgoBody and RICH demonstrate that MoRo substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and motion realism under occlusions, while performing on-par in non-occluded scenarios.

However, pixel-wise multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs) remain difficult to scale due to complex region-level encoders, specialized segmentation decoders, and incompatible training objectives. To address these challenges, we present SAMTok, a discrete mask tokenizer that converts any region mask into two special tokens and reconstructs the mask using these tokens with high fidelity. By treating masks as new language tokens, SAMTok enables base MLLMs (such as the QwenVL series) to learn pixel-wise capabilities through standard next-token prediction and simple reinforcement learning, without architectural modifications and specialized loss design. SAMTok builds on SAM2 and is trained on 209M diverse masks using a mask encoder and residual vector quantizer to produce discrete, compact, and information-rich tokens. With 5M SAMTok-formatted mask understanding and generation data samples, QwenVL-SAMTok attains state-of-the-art or comparable results on region captioning, region VQA, grounded conversation, referring segmentation, scene graph parsing, and multi-round interactive segmentation. We further introduce a textual answer-matching reward that enables efficient reinforcement learning for mask generation, delivering substantial improvements on GRES and GCG benchmarks.

We introduce ActionMesh, a generative model that predicts production-ready 3D meshes \"in action\" in a feed-forward manner. Drawing inspiration from early video models, our key insight is to modify existing 3D diffusion models to include a temporal axis, resulting in a framework we dubbed \"temporal 3D diffusion\". Specifically, we first adapt the 3D diffusion stage to generate a sequence of synchronized latents representing time-varying and independent 3D shapes. Second, we design a temporal 3D autoencoder that translates a sequence of independent shapes into the corresponding deformations of a pre-defined reference shape, allowing us to build an animation. Combining these two components, ActionMesh generates animated 3D meshes from different inputs like a monocular video, a text description, or even a 3D mesh with a text prompt describing its animation. Besides, compared to previous approaches, our method is fast and produces results that are rig-free and topology consistent, hence enabling rapid iteration and seamless applications like texturing and retargeting.

Existing approaches often rely on explicit geometric alignment between the perspective and the equirectangular projection (ERP) space. Yet, this requires known camera metadata, obscuring the application to in-the-wild data where such calibration is typically absent or noisy. We propose 360Anything, a geometry-free framework built upon pre-trained diffusion transformers. By treating the perspective input and the panorama target simply as token sequences, 360Anything learns the perspective-to-equirectangular mapping in a purely data-driven way, eliminating the need for camera information. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on both image and video perspective-to-360\u00b0 generation, outperforming prior works that use ground-truth camera information. We also trace the root cause of the seam artifacts at ERP boundaries to zero-padding in the VAE encoder, and introduce Circular Latent Encoding to facilitate seamless generation. Finally, we show competitive results in zero-shot camera FoV and orientation estimation benchmarks, demonstrating 360Anything's deep geometric understanding and broader utility in computer vision tasks.

In this work, we investigate whether this framework can scale to large-scale, freeform text-to-image (T2I) generation. We first scale RAE decoders on the frozen representation encoder (SigLIP-2) beyond ImageNet by training on web, synthetic, and text-rendering data, finding that while scale improves general fidelity, targeted data composition is essential for specific domains like text. We then rigorously stress-test the RAE design choices originally proposed for ImageNet. Our analysis reveals that scaling simplifies the framework: while dimension-dependent noise scheduling remains critical, architectural complexities such as wide diffusion heads and noise-augmented decoding offer negligible benefits at scale Building on this simplified framework, we conduct a controlled comparison of RAE against the state-of-the-art FLUX VAE across diffusion transformer scales from 0.5B to 9.8B parameters. RAEs consistently outperform VAEs during pretraining across all model scales. Further, during finetuning on high-quality datasets, VAE-based models catastrophically overfit after 64 epochs, while RAE models remain stable through 256 epochs and achieve consistently better performance. Across all experiments, RAE-based diffusion models demonstrate faster convergence and better generation quality, establishing RAEs as a simpler and stronger foundation than VAEs for large-scale T2I generation. Additionally, because both visual understanding and generation can operate in a shared representation space, the multimodal model can directly reason over generated latents, opening new possibilities for unified models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86Representation Autoencoders\uff08RAEs\uff09\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edfVAEs\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22RAEs\u6846\u67b6\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u81ea\u7531\u5f62\u5f0f\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982VAEs\uff09\u5728\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "1) \u6269\u5c55\u73b0\u6709RAE\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684SigLIP-2\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u591a\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b2) \u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790RAE\u5728ImageNet\u4e0a\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\u5728\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff1b3) \u4e0eFLUX VAE\u4ece0.5B\u52309.8B\u53c2\u6570\u89c4\u6a21\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "1) \u6570\u636e\u7ec4\u6210\u5f71\u54cd\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u67b6\u6784\u7b80\u5355\u5316\uff08\u5982\u79fb\u9664\u590d\u6742\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff09\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u65e0\u635f\uff1b2) RAE\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6027\u80fd\u5168\u9762\u8d85\u8d8aVAEs\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u9636\u6bb5VAEs\u6a21\u578b\u572864epoch\u540e\u5d29\u6e83\u800cRAEs\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\uff1b3) \u6240\u6709\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2dRAEs\u5747\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5feb\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u66f4\u4f18\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "RAE\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5316\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u5171\u4eab\u8868\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u6210\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u7684\u65b0\u57fa\u5ea7\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002"}}

We find that existing Zero-Shot Compositional Action Recognition (ZS-CAR) models fail primarily due to an overlooked failure mode: object-driven verb shortcuts. Through systematic analysis, we show that this behavior arises from two intertwined factors: severe sparsity and skewness of compositional supervision, and the asymmetric learning difficulty between verbs and objects. As training progresses, the existing ZS-CAR model increasingly ignores visual evidence and overfits to co-occurrence statistics. Consequently, the existing model does not gain the benefit of compositional recognition in unseen verb-object compositions. To address this, we propose RCORE, a simple and effective framework that enforces temporally grounded verb learning. RCORE introduces (i) a composition-aware augmentation that diversifies verb-object combinations without corrupting motion cues, and (ii) a temporal order regularization loss that penalizes shortcut behaviors by explicitly modeling temporal structure. Across two benchmarks, Sth-com and our newly constructed EK100-com, RCORE significantly improves unseen composition accuracy, reduces reliance on co-occurrence bias, and achieves consistently positive compositional gaps.

However, the camera controllability still remains limited. In this work, we build upon Reward Feedback Learning and aim to further improve camera controllability. However, directly borrowing existing ReFL approaches faces several challenges. First, current reward models lack the capacity to assess video-camera alignment. Second, decoding latent into RGB videos for reward computation introduces substantial computational overhead. Third, 3D geometric information is typically neglected during video decoding. To address these limitations, we introduce an efficient camera-aware 3D decoder that decodes video latent into 3D representations for reward quantization. Specifically, video latent along with the camera pose are decoded into 3D Gaussians. In this process, the camera pose not only acts as input, but also serves as a projection parameter. Misalignment between the video latent and camera pose will cause geometric distortions in the 3D structure, resulting in blurry renderings. Based on this property, we explicitly optimize pixel-level consistency between the rendered novel views and ground-truth ones as reward. To accommodate the stochastic nature, we further introduce a visibility term that selectively supervises only deterministic regions derived via geometric warping. Extensive experiments conducted on RealEstate10K and WorldScore benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.
