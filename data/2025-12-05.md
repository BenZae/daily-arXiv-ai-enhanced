TL;DR: OnSight Pathology是无需集成的轻量级AI平台，基于屏幕截图实现数字病理实时分析，兼容多种图像源且无需云端传输，降低部署门槛并提升可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统病理诊断依赖专家主观判读且耗时，现有AI方案受困于私有化部署要求、软件复杂性及实时性不足，缺乏可解释性和跨系统兼容性。

Method: 通过自定义屏幕捕捉实时获取图像流，使用本地轻量化模型进行多任务分析（肿瘤分类、有丝分裂计数、染色量化），集成视觉-语言模型生成可验证的无标签描述，并支持显微镜及手机直连实时分析。

Result: 在2500+全切片图像及临床场景验证，准确率与传统AI相当，推理延迟<0.5秒，单台笔记本即可运行，兼容主流数字病理系统及安卓/iOS设备。

Conclusion: 该框架突破了AI病理部署的硬件依赖和系统封闭性限制，通过屏幕直采+本地实时推理+可解释性增强的三位一体架构，为术中快速诊断和低资源地区远程病理提供了新范式。

Abstract: The microscopic examination of surgical tissue remains a cornerstone of disease classification but relies on subjective interpretations and access to highly specialized experts, which can compromise accuracy and clinical care. While emerging breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI) offer promise for automated histological analysis, the growing number of proprietary digital pathology solutions has created barriers to real-world deployment. To address these challenges, we introduce OnSight Pathology, a platform-agnostic computer vision software that uses continuous custom screen captures to provide real-time AI inferences to users as they review digital slide images. Accessible as a single, self-contained executable file (https://onsightpathology.github.io/ ), OnSight Pathology operates locally on consumer-grade personal computers without complex software integration, enabling cost-effective and secure deployment in research and clinical workflows. Here we demonstrate the utility of OnSight Pathology using over 2,500 publicly available whole slide images across different slide viewers, as well as cases from our clinical digital pathology setup. The software's robustness is highlighted across routine histopathological tasks, including the classification of common brain tumor types, mitosis detection, and the quantification of immunohistochemical stains. A built-in multi-modal chat assistant provides verifiable descriptions of images, free of rigid class labels, for added quality control. Lastly, we show compatibility with live microscope camera feeds, including from personal smartphones, offering potential for deployment in more analog, inter-operative, and telepathology settings. Together, we highlight how OnSight Pathology can deliver real-time AI inferences across a broad range of pathology pipelines, removing key barriers to the adoption of AI tools in histopathology.

TL;DR: LAPA提出了一种基于Transformer的多摄像头点跟踪架构，整合外观匹配和几何约束，解决传统方法中的误差传播和时间不一致问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将检测、关联和跟踪解耦，导致误差传播和时间不一致，尤其在复杂场景中表现不佳。

Method: 跨视角注意力机制融合几何先验，基于注意力权重的3D点表征，以及Transformer解码器维护时间一致性。

Result: 在TAPVid-3D-MC和PointOdyssey-MC数据集上分别达到37.5% APD和90.3% APD，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LAPA通过一体化设计，在复杂运动和遮挡场景中表现优异，代码已开源。

Abstract: This paper presents LAPA (Look Around and Pay Attention), a novel end-to-end transformer-based architecture for multi-camera point tracking that integrates appearance-based matching with geometric constraints. Traditional pipelines decouple detection, association, and tracking, leading to error propagation and temporal inconsistency in challenging scenarios. LAPA addresses these limitations by leveraging attention mechanisms to jointly reason across views and time, establishing soft correspondences through a cross-view attention mechanism enhanced with geometric priors. Instead of relying on classical triangulation, we construct 3D point representations via attention-weighted aggregation, inherently accommodating uncertainty and partial observations. Temporal consistency is further maintained through a transformer decoder that models long-range dependencies, preserving identities through extended occlusions. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets, including our newly created multi-camera (MC) versions of TAPVid-3D panoptic and PointOdyssey, demonstrate that our unified approach significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving 37.5% APD on TAPVid-3D-MC and 90.3% APD on PointOdyssey-MC, particularly excelling in scenarios with complex motions and occlusions.

### [3] [Generalized Event Partonomy Inference with Structured Hierarchical Predictive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04219)
*Zhou Chen,Joe Lin,Sathyanarayanan N. Aakur\\*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PARSE框架通过层次化预测模型，无需监督学习视频多尺度事件结构，实现人类级别的分层事件理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类自然将连续经验视为嵌套事件层次，但现有计算机视觉模型难以同时实现预测性与层次化视频分割。

Method: 提出PARSE框架：构建层次化循环预测器，各层在不同时间粒度运作，底层建模短期动态，高层通过注意力反馈整合长期上下文；事件边界由预测误差峰值自动确定。

Result: 在Breakfast Actions/50 Salads/Assembly 101数据集上，PARSE在流式方法中取得SOTA，时间对齐（H-GEBD）和结构一致性（TED,hF1）指标接近离线基线。

Conclusion: 预测学习在不确定性下能实现可扩展的人类级时序抽象，证明自监督预测机制可有效构建视频事件层次结构。

Abstract: Humans naturally perceive continuous experience as a hierarchy of temporally nested events, fine-grained actions embedded within coarser routines. Replicating this structure in computer vision requires models that can segment video not just retrospectively, but predictively and hierarchically. We introduce PARSE, a unified framework that learns multiscale event structure directly from streaming video without supervision. PARSE organizes perception into a hierarchy of recurrent predictors, each operating at its own temporal granularity: lower layers model short-term dynamics while higher layers integrate longer-term context through attention-based feedback. Event boundaries emerge naturally as transient peaks in prediction error, yielding temporally coherent, nested partonomies that mirror the containment relations observed in human event perception. Evaluated across three benchmarks, Breakfast Actions, 50 Salads, and Assembly 101, PARSE achieves state-of-the-art performance among streaming methods and rivals offline baselines in both temporal alignment (H-GEBD) and structural consistency (TED, hF1). The results demonstrate that predictive learning under uncertainty provides a scalable path toward human-like temporal abstraction and compositional event understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出MoReGen框架，结合LLM、物理模拟器和渲染器生成符合物理规律的视频，并构建MoReSet基准测试集评估物理真实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管文本生成视频在逼真度上进步显著，但现有方法在物理规律遵循和运动连贯性方面仍存在不足，难以确保视频内容符合牛顿力学原理。

Method: 采用多智能体LLM架构，融入物理模拟引擎与渲染模块的代码生成框架MoReGen。构建包含1275个标注视频的MoReSet基准测试集，包含时空关系与真值轨迹标注，提出物体轨迹一致性作为核心评估指标。

Result: 实验表明当前SOTA模型物理一致性不足，MoReGen在MoReSet基准测试中展现出显著的物理有效性提升，实现了可复现的物理规律遵循视频生成。

Conclusion: 物理感知的代码生成框架能有效提升视频生成的物理真实性，MoReSet与相关评估指标为未来研究提供了标准化基准，验证了物理建模对多模态生成任务的重要性。

Abstract: While text-to-video (T2V) generation has achieved remarkable progress in photorealism, generating intent-aligned videos that faithfully obey physics principles remains a core challenge. In this work, we systematically study Newtonian motion-controlled text-to-video generation and evaluation, emphasizing physical precision and motion coherence. We introduce MoReGen, a motion-aware, physics-grounded T2V framework that integrates multi-agent LLMs, physics simulators, and renderers to generate reproducible, physically accurate videos from text prompts in the code domain. To quantitatively assess physical validity, we propose object-trajectory correspondence as a direct evaluation metric and present MoReSet, a benchmark of 1,275 human-annotated videos spanning nine classes of Newtonian phenomena with scene descriptions, spatiotemporal relations, and ground-truth trajectories. Using MoReSet, we conduct experiments on existing T2V models, evaluating their physical validity through both our MoRe metrics and existing physics-based evaluators. Our results reveal that state-of-the-art models struggle to maintain physical validity, while MoReGen establishes a principled direction toward physically coherent video synthesis.

### [5] [ReasonX: MLLM-Guided Intrinsic Image Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04222)
*Alara Dirik,Tuanfeng Wang,Duygu Ceylan,Stefanos Zafeiriou,Anna Frühstück*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ReasonX框架，通过多模态大语言模型作为感知判官提供相对比较，利用GRPO奖励机制微调无标签真实世界图像的内在分解模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散和Transformer的模型依赖合成数据配对监督，但在多样现实场景中泛化能力不足，需探索无监督微调方法以提升实际应用效果。

Method: 构建模型无关的ReasonX框架：1) 使用多模态大语言模型对内在属性进行关系判断；2) 通过GRPO算法将判官的比较结果转化为奖励信号；3) 在无标签图像上实现条件内在预测的一致性优化。

Result: 在IIW反照率任务实现9-25%的WHDR指标下降，在ETH3D深度估计任务提升46%精度，验证了框架对不同架构和模态的兼容性。

Conclusion: 多模态大语言模型引导的比较监督范式有效弥合了低层视觉与高层推理的认知鸿沟，为无监督视觉任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Intrinsic image decomposition aims to separate images into physical components such as albedo, depth, normals, and illumination. While recent diffusion- and transformer-based models benefit from paired supervision from synthetic datasets, their generalization to diverse, real-world scenarios remains challenging. We propose ReasonX, a novel framework that leverages a multimodal large language model (MLLM) as a perceptual judge providing relative intrinsic comparisons, and uses these comparisons as GRPO rewards for fine-tuning intrinsic decomposition models on unlabeled, in-the-wild images. Unlike RL methods for generative models, our framework aligns conditional intrinsic predictors by rewarding agreement between the judge's relational assessments and analytically derived relations from the model's outputs. ReasonX is model-agnostic and can be applied to different intrinsic predictors. Across multiple base architectures and modalities, ReasonX yields significant improvements, including 9-25% WHDR reduction on IIW albedo and up to 46% depth accuracy gains on ETH3D, highlighting the promise of MLLM-guided comparative supervision to bridge low- and high-level vision reasoning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 引入AdversarialAnatomyBench基准测试自然发生罕见解剖变异，揭示当前视觉-语言模型在罕见解剖结构上的准确率从74%骤降至29%，暴露模型缩放和干预手段均无法解决的系统性缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉-语言模型基准测试仅针对常见解剖结构，缺乏对临床实际应用中罕见解剖变异场景的评估体系。

Method: 构建首个涵盖多模态医学影像的罕见解剖变异基准AdversarialAnatomyBench，评估22个SOTA模型在基础医学感知任务中的表现，并分析错误模式与解剖偏向的关联性。

Result: 1) 平均准确率从典型解剖的74%下降到非典型解剖的29%；2) 前三大模型GPT-5/Gemini 2.5 Pro/Llama 4 Maverick均下降41-51%；3) 模型错误与解剖学预期偏差高度吻合；4) 模型扩展和偏差感知提示等改进措施无效。

Conclusion: 揭示视觉-语言模型在罕见解剖场景下的范式级缺陷，证明仅靠模型规模扩展无法突破此瓶颈，提出的新型基准为医疗AI系统的解剖学偏差量化评估提供了标准化工具。

Abstract: Vision-language models are increasingly integrated into clinical workflows. However, existing benchmarks primarily assess performance on common anatomical presentations and fail to capture the challenges posed by rare variants. To address this gap, we introduce AdversarialAnatomyBench, the first benchmark comprising naturally occurring rare anatomical variants across diverse imaging modalities and anatomical regions. We call such variants that violate learned priors about "typical" human anatomy natural adversarial anatomy. Benchmarking 22 state-of-the-art VLMs with AdversarialAnatomyBench yielded three key insights. First, when queried with basic medical perception tasks, mean accuracy dropped from 74% on typical to 29% on atypical anatomy. Even the best-performing models, GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Llama 4 Maverick, showed performance drops of 41-51%. Second, model errors closely mirrored expected anatomical biases. Third, neither model scaling nor interventions, including bias-aware prompting and test-time reasoning, resolved these issues. These findings highlight a critical and previously unquantified limitation in current VLM: their poor generalization to rare anatomical presentations. AdversarialAnatomyBench provides a foundation for systematically measuring and mitigating anatomical bias in multimodal medical AI systems.

*Shaoheng Fang,Chaohui Yu,Fan Wang,Qixing Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MVRoom: Controllable 3D indoor scene synthesis via multi-view diffusion with a 3D layout


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in high-fidelity and controllable novel view synthesis (NVS) for complex indoor scenes

Method: Two-stage pipeline with (1) coarse 3D layout bridging image-based conditions and (2) layout-aware epipolar attention during diffusion, combined with an iterative text-to-scene framework

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art NVS results with high-fidelity multi-view consistency and complex scene generation capabilities

Conclusion: 3D layout conditioning and epipolar attention mechanisms enable superior controllability and realism in 3D scene synthesis

Abstract: We introduce MVRoom, a controllable novel view synthesis (NVS) pipeline for 3D indoor scenes that uses multi-view diffusion conditioned on a coarse 3D layout. MVRoom employs a two-stage design in which the 3D layout is used throughout to enforce multi-view consistency. The first stage employs novel representations to effectively bridge the 3D layout and consistent image-based condition signals for multi-view generation. The second stage performs image-conditioned multi-view generation, incorporating a layout-aware epipolar attention mechanism to enhance multi-view consistency during the diffusion process. Additionally, we introduce an iterative framework that generates 3D scenes with varying numbers of objects and scene complexities by recursively performing multi-view generation (MVRoom), supporting text-to-scene generation. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves high-fidelity and controllable 3D scene generation for NVS, outperforming state-of-the-art baseline methods both quantitatively and qualitatively. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of key components within our generation pipeline.

### [8] [UniLight: A Unified Representation for Lighting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04267)
*Zitian Zhang,Iliyan Georgiev,Michael Fischer,Yannick Hold-Geoffroy,Jean-François Lalonde,Valentin Deschaintre*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces UniLight, a unified latent space representation for lighting that bridges multiple modalities (text, images, irradiance, environment maps) using contrastive training and spherical harmonics prediction, enabling cross-modal transfer and flexible lighting control in image synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing lighting representations (e.g., environment maps, text) are incompatible, restricting cross-modal transfer and limiting applications in retrieval, generation, and lighting manipulation tasks.

Method: Modality-specific encoders are trained contrastively to align representations in a shared latent space, with an auxiliary task predicting spherical harmonics to improve directional understanding. A multi-modal pipeline supports large-scale training across lighting-based retrieval, environment-map generation, and diffusion-based lighting control.

Result: UniLight achieves consistent and transferable lighting features, demonstrating effectiveness in cross-modal retrieval, high-quality environment-map synthesis, and precise lighting manipulation in diffusion models.

Conclusion: This work unifies diverse lighting modalities into a single latent space, enabling seamless cross-modal interaction and opening new capabilities for lighting-aware image editing and generation.

Abstract: Lighting has a strong influence on visual appearance, yet understanding and representing lighting in images remains notoriously difficult. Various lighting representations exist, such as environment maps, irradiance, spherical harmonics, or text, but they are incompatible, which limits cross-modal transfer. We thus propose UniLight, a joint latent space as lighting representation, that unifies multiple modalities within a shared embedding. Modality-specific encoders for text, images, irradiance, and environment maps are trained contrastively to align their representations, with an auxiliary spherical-harmonics prediction task reinforcing directional understanding. Our multi-modal data pipeline enables large-scale training and evaluation across three tasks: lighting-based retrieval, environment-map generation, and lighting control in diffusion-based image synthesis. Experiments show that our representation captures consistent and transferable lighting features, enabling flexible manipulation across modalities.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合GRU-NF与随机采样方法的推理时优化技术（GRU-SNF），通过在推理阶段引入马尔可夫链蒙特卡洛（MCMC）步骤，增强时序预测的多样性，同时保持准确性，适用于视频运动迁移等实时应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GRU-NF模型的确定性结构限制了其对多模态分布的表达能力，而实时视频运动迁移等应用需要既准确又多样化的未来预测以支持下游决策。

Method: 在GRU-NF推理阶段引入MCMC步骤，通过模拟随机动力学扩展输出空间，结合归一化流与门控循环单元框架，无需重新训练即可增强模型的多模态建模能力。

Result: GRU-SNF在人体关键点视频运动迁移任务中，在长时序预测下仍能保持预测精度的同时，生成比GRU-NF更丰富的多样化动作轨迹，且时间连贯性与感知质量更优。

Conclusion: 推理阶段的随机性注入能有效提升基于归一化流的时序模型对多模态行为的捕捉能力，为生成式时间序列预测提供了结合确定性框架与随机动力学的新范式。

Abstract: Real-time video motion transfer applications such as immersive gaming and vision-based anomaly detection require accurate yet diverse future predictions to support realistic synthesis and robust downstream decision making under uncertainty. To improve the diversity of such sequential forecasts we propose a novel inference-time refinement technique that combines Gated Recurrent Unit-Normalizing Flows (GRU-NF) with stochastic sampling methods. While GRU-NF can capture multimodal distributions through its integration of normalizing flows within a temporal forecasting framework, its deterministic transformation structure can limit expressivity. To address this, inspired by Stochastic Normalizing Flows (SNF), we introduce Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) steps during GRU-NF inference, enabling the model to explore a richer output space and better approximate the true data distribution without retraining. We validate our approach in a keypoint-based video motion transfer pipeline, where capturing temporally coherent and perceptually diverse future trajectories is essential for realistic samples and low bandwidth communication. Experiments show that our inference framework, Gated Recurrent Unit- Stochastic Normalizing Flows (GRU-SNF) outperforms GRU-NF in generating diverse outputs without sacrificing accuracy, even under longer prediction horizons. By injecting stochasticity during inference, our approach captures multimodal behavior more effectively. These results highlight the potential of integrating stochastic dynamics with flow-based sequence models for generative time series forecasting.

### [10] [Plug-and-Play Image Restoration with Flow Matching: A Continuous Viewpoint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04283)
*Fan Jia,Yuhao Huang,Shih-Hsin Wang,Cristina Garcia-Cardona,Andrea L. Bertozzi,Bao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper develops a stochastic differential equation (SDE) surrogate model for plug-and-play flow matching (PnP-Flow) to improve image restoration. It identifies error sources and proposes improvements (error reduction, acceleration) validated through experiments like denoising and super-resolution, which outperform existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite empirical success of PnP-Flow in image restoration, its theoretical foundation remains underdeveloped. The paper aims to bridge this gap by deriving a continuous SDE framework to rigorously analyze and enhance the model's performance.

Method: A continuous SDE was derived as a surrogate model for PnP-Flow, providing theoretical insights. The SDE analysis quantifies restoration error, leading to optimized step scheduling and Lipschitz regularization. Additionally, extrapolation was applied to accelerate existing PnP-Flow models, validated through benchmark image restoration tasks (denoising, deblurring, super-resolution, inpainting).

Result: The proposed SDE-informed PnP-Flow improvements outperformed baseline PnP-Flow and state-of-the-art methods across multiple image restoration tasks, achieving superior performance in standard evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: The SDE-based theoretical framework enhances the understanding and effectiveness of PnP-Flow, offering two key innovations: error quantification for neural network regularization and acceleration via extrapolation. This advances both the theory and practical application of flow matching in image restoration.

Abstract: Flow matching-based generative models have been integrated into the plug-and-play image restoration framework, and the resulting plug-and-play flow matching (PnP-Flow) model has achieved some remarkable empirical success for image restoration. However, the theoretical understanding of PnP-Flow lags its empirical success. In this paper, we derive a continuous limit for PnP-Flow, resulting in a stochastic differential equation (SDE) surrogate model of PnP-Flow. The SDE model provides two particular insights to improve PnP-Flow for image restoration: (1) It enables us to quantify the error for image restoration, informing us to improve step scheduling and regularize the Lipschitz constant of the neural network-parameterized vector field for error reduction. (2) It informs us to accelerate off-the-shelf PnP-Flow models via extrapolation, resulting in a rescaled version of the proposed SDE model. We validate the efficacy of the SDE-informed improved PnP-Flow using several benchmark tasks, including image denoising, deblurring, super-resolution, and inpainting. Numerical results show that our method significantly outperforms the baseline PnP-Flow and other state-of-the-art approaches, achieving superior performance across evaluation metrics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出在JPEG编码特征上直接训练深度学习模型，通过减少解码计算开销提升数据加载效率，适用于单图像超分辨率任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型复杂度和数据规模的增长导致数据加载成为训练与推理瓶颈，而现有硬件改进难以缓解该问题。

Method: 设计轻量级超分辨率流水线，在频域处理JPEG离散余弦变换（DCT）系数，跳过完整解码过程以提升效率。

Result: 实现数据加载速度提升2.6倍、训练速度提升2.5倍，同时保持与标准SISR方法相当的视觉质量。

Conclusion: 该方法验证了直接操作JPEG编码特征的有效性，拓展了该技术在图像修复任务（而非仅识别任务）的应用潜力。

Abstract: Deep learning models have grown increasingly complex, with input data sizes scaling accordingly. Despite substantial advances in specialized deep learning hardware, data loading continues to be a major bottleneck that limits training and inference speed. To address this challenge, we propose training models directly on encoded JPEG features, reducing the computational overhead associated with full JPEG decoding and significantly improving data loading efficiency. While prior works have focused on recognition tasks, we investigate the effectiveness of this approach for the restoration task of single-image super-resolution (SISR). We present a lightweight super-resolution pipeline that operates on JPEG discrete cosine transform (DCT) coefficients in the frequency domain. Our pipeline achieves a 2.6x speedup in data loading and a 2.5x speedup in training, while preserving visual quality comparable to standard SISR approaches.

TL;DR: GfM 提出一种轻量级单目几何估计方法，通过解耦全局和局部结构实现高精度车辆周围3D感知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单目深度估计会过平滑路面细节（如凸起/坡度），导致影响车辆控制的关键信息丢失，需要在避免过拟合的同时保留近场道路特征。

Method: 预测主导路面平面并结合gamma（无量纲垂直偏离比值）表示残差变化，利用相机高度参数通过闭式解恢复度量深度，采用自监督学习框架实现无需标注数据的训练。

Result: 在KITTI和RSRD数据集上近场区域深度估计达到SOTA精度，参数仅8.88M的轻量化模型具有跨相机配置鲁棒性，且首次在RSRD数据集完成自监督单目方法验证。

Conclusion: GfM 通过物理可解释模型实现了单目深度估计的突破，同时具备轻量化参数量、自监督训练优势和无需标定的实用特性，为自动驾驶提供了兼顾精度与可行性的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate perception of the vehicle's 3D surroundings, including fine-scale road geometry, such as bumps, slopes, and surface irregularities, is essential for safe and comfortable vehicle control. However, conventional monocular depth estimation often oversmooths these features, losing critical information for motion planning and stability. To address this, we introduce Gamma-from-Mono (GfM), a lightweight monocular geometry estimation method that resolves the projective ambiguity in single-camera reconstruction by decoupling global and local structure. GfM predicts a dominant road surface plane together with residual variations expressed by gamma, a dimensionless measure of vertical deviation from the plane, defined as the ratio of a point's height above it to its depth from the camera, and grounded in established planar parallax geometry. With only the camera's height above ground, this representation deterministically recovers metric depth via a closed form, avoiding full extrinsic calibration and naturally prioritizing near-road detail. Its physically interpretable formulation makes it well suited for self-supervised learning, eliminating the need for large annotated datasets. Evaluated on KITTI and the Road Surface Reconstruction Dataset (RSRD), GfM achieves state-of-the-art near-field accuracy in both depth and gamma estimation while maintaining competitive global depth performance. Our lightweight 8.88M-parameter model adapts robustly across diverse camera setups and, to our knowledge, is the first self-supervised monocular approach evaluated on RSRD.

TL;DR: 研究在联邦学习（FL）框架下CLIP模型的校准问题，发现现有方法效果有限，提出基于LoRA的FL²oRA改进方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管CLIP等视觉语言模型的离线校准已被研究，但联邦学习中微调CLIP的校准影响尚未探索，需解决分布式环境中模型可靠性问题。

Method: 分析文本提示调优在FL中的校准退化现象，评估四种全局聚合方法的校准技术效果，并提出FL²oRA（LoRA-based方法）改进校准。

Conclusion: FL²oRA通过聚焦可微调组件选择，自然优化联邦学习中的CLIP校准，减少显式校准需求。

Abstract: While vision-language models like CLIP have been extensively studied, their calibration, crucial for reliable predictions, has received limited attention. Although a few prior works have examined CLIP calibration in offline settings, the impact of fine-tuning CLIP in a federated learning (FL) setup remains unexplored. In this work, we investigate how FL affects CLIP calibration and propose strategies to improve reliability in this distributed setting. We first analyze Textual Prompt Tuning approaches and show that they degrade calibration metrics when operating under FL. We also evaluate existing in-training calibration techniques across four global aggregation methods, finding that they provide limited improvements. Our results suggest that the key challenge lies not only in how we aggregate or calibrate, but in which components we choose to fine-tune. Motivated by this insight, we propose $\text{FL}^2\text{oRA}$, a straightforward LoRA-based approach that naturally improves calibration in FL, and we analyze the factors behind its effectiveness. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that $\text{FL}^2\text{oRA}$ consistently produces well-calibrated models, reducing the need for explicit calibration procedures.

Abstract: Image captioning has drawn considerable attention from the natural language processing and computer vision fields. Aiming to reduce the reliance on curated data, several studies have explored image captioning without any humanly-annotated image-text pairs for training, although existing methods are still outperformed by fully supervised approaches. This paper proposes TOMCap, i.e., an improved text-only training method that performs captioning without the need for aligned image-caption pairs. The method is based on prompting a pre-trained language model decoder with information derived from a CLIP representation, after undergoing a process to reduce the modality gap. We specifically tested the combined use of retrieved examples of captions, and latent vector representations, to guide the generation process. Through extensive experiments, we show that TOMCap outperforms other training-free and text-only methods. We also analyze the impact of different choices regarding the configuration of the retrieval-augmentation and modality gap reduction components.

Abstract: The global demand for sustainable protein sources is driving increasing interest in edible insects, with Acheta domesticus (house cricket) identified as one of the most suitable species for industrial production. Current farming practices typically rear crickets in mixed-sex populations without automated sex sorting, despite potential benefits such as selective breeding, optimized reproduction ratios, and nutritional differentiation. This work presents a low-cost, real-time system for automated sex-based sorting of Acheta domesticus, combining computer vision and physical actuation. The device integrates a Raspberry Pi 5 with the official Raspberry AI Camera and a custom YOLOv8 nano object detection model, together with a servo-actuated sorting arm. The model reached a mean Average Precision at IoU 0.5 (mAP@0.5) of 0.977 during testing, and real-world experiments with groups of crickets achieved an overall sorting accuracy of 86.8%. These results demonstrate the feasibility of deploying lightweight deep learning models on resource-constrained devices for insect farming applications, offering a practical solution to improve efficiency and sustainability in cricket production.

Abstract: Current expressive avatar systems rely heavily on visual cues, failing when faces are occluded or when emotions remain internal. We present Mind-to-Face, the first framework that decodes non-invasive electroencephalogram (EEG) signals directly into high-fidelity facial expressions. We build a dual-modality recording setup to obtain synchronized EEG and multi-view facial video during emotion-eliciting stimuli, enabling precise supervision for neural-to-visual learning. Our model uses a CNN-Transformer encoder to map EEG signals into dense 3D position maps, capable of sampling over 65k vertices, capturing fine-scale geometry and subtle emotional dynamics, and renders them through a modified 3D Gaussian Splatting pipeline for photorealistic, view-consistent results. Through extensive evaluation, we show that EEG alone can reliably predict dynamic, subject-specific facial expressions, including subtle emotional responses, demonstrating that neural signals contain far richer affective and geometric information than previously assumed. Mind-to-Face establishes a new paradigm for neural-driven avatars, enabling personalized, emotion-aware telepresence and cognitive interaction in immersive environments.

*Jiashu Liao,Pietro Liò,Marc de Kamps,Duygu Sarikaya*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DisentangleFormer addresses the entanglement issue in Vision Transformers by decoupling spatial and channel dimensions, enabling better modeling of structural and semantic dependencies, especially beneficial for hyperspectral imaging tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard self-attention in Vision Transformers conflates spatial and channel dimensions, leading to entangled representations. This is critical in hyperspectral imaging (e.g., satellite sensing, pathology) where channels encode distinct biophysical/chemical cues. Independent modeling of spatial/semantic dependencies is required to reduce redundancy and improve robustness.

Method: Proposes a decoupled architecture with three components: (1) Parallel Disentanglement for separate spatial-channel token streams, (2) Squeezed Token Enhancer for adaptive stream fusion, and (3) Multi-Scale FFN to integrate local-global context. The design is guided by information-theoretic decorrelation principles to minimize redundancy between streams.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on hyperspectral datasets (Indian Pine, Pavia University, Houston, BigEarthNet, infrared pathology) and retains competitive ImageNet accuracy while reducing computational cost by 17.8% (FLOPs).

Conclusion: DisentangleFormer’s spatial-channel decoupling enhances representation learning for multi-channel vision tasks, particularly hyperspectral imaging, with improved accuracy and efficiency across diverse benchmarks.

Abstract: Vision Transformers face a fundamental limitation: standard self-attention jointly processes spatial and channel dimensions, leading to entangled representations that prevent independent modeling of structural and semantic dependencies. This problem is especially pronounced in hyperspectral imaging, from satellite hyperspectral remote sensing to infrared pathology imaging, where channels capture distinct biophysical or biochemical cues. We propose DisentangleFormer, an architecture that achieves robust multi-channel vision representation through principled spatial-channel decoupling. Motivated by information-theoretic principles of decorrelated representation learning, our parallel design enables independent modeling of structural and semantic cues while minimizing redundancy between spatial and channel streams. Our design integrates three core components: (1) Parallel Disentanglement: Independently processes spatial-token and channel-token streams, enabling decorrelated feature learning across spatial and spectral dimensions, (2) Squeezed Token Enhancer: An adaptive calibration module that dynamically fuses spatial and channel streams, and (3) Multi-Scale FFN: complementing global attention with multi-scale local context to capture fine-grained structural and semantic dependencies. Extensive experiments on hyperspectral benchmarks demonstrate that DisentangleFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently outperforming existing models on Indian Pine, Pavia University, and Houston, the large-scale BigEarthNet remote sensing dataset, as well as an infrared pathology dataset. Moreover, it retains competitive accuracy on ImageNet while reducing computational cost by 17.8% in FLOPs. The code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

TL;DR: 本文提出SyncTrack4D，一种基于多视频动态3D场景建模的4D高斯点阵方法，通过密集4D轨迹追踪和跨视频同步优化，实现了无需预定义物体或先验模型的高精度4D重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态3D场景建模因高维时空特性需多视角信息聚合，现有方法依赖预定义物体或同步数据限制实际应用，本文旨在解决真实场景下非同步视频序列的时空对齐与重建问题。

Result: 在Panoptic Studio和SyncNeRF数据集上验证，平均时序误差低于0.26帧，重建质量达26.3 PSNR分，首次实现在非同步视频上无需先验模型的通用4D高斯点阵重建。

Conclusion: 提出首个通用的非同步视频4D重建框架，通过4D轨迹引导的同步优化机制，突破了传统方法对同步数据和物体先验的依赖，为动态场景建模提供了新范式。

Abstract: Modeling dynamic 3D scenes is challenging due to their high-dimensional nature, which requires aggregating information from multiple views to reconstruct time-evolving 3D geometry and motion. We present a novel multi-video 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) approach designed to handle real-world, unsynchronized video sets. Our approach, SyncTrack4D, directly leverages dense 4D track representation of dynamic scene parts as cues for simultaneous cross-video synchronization and 4DGS reconstruction. We first compute dense per-video 4D feature tracks and cross-video track correspondences by Fused Gromov-Wasserstein optimal transport approach. Next, we perform global frame-level temporal alignment to maximize overlapping motion of matched 4D tracks. Finally, we achieve sub-frame synchronization through our multi-video 4D Gaussian splatting built upon a motion-spline scaffold representation. The final output is a synchronized 4DGS representation with dense, explicit 3D trajectories, and temporal offsets for each video. We evaluate our approach on the Panoptic Studio and SyncNeRF Blender, demonstrating sub-frame synchronization accuracy with an average temporal error below 0.26 frames, and high-fidelity 4D reconstruction reaching 26.3 PSNR scores on the Panoptic Studio dataset. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first general 4D Gaussian Splatting approach for unsynchronized video sets, without assuming the existence of predefined scene objects or prior models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具难以在大量仓库中有效发现、提取和验证神经模块，影响研究效率。

Method: 采用范围感知依赖解析、导入保持重建和验证器门控提升，结合多级去重（精确/词法/结构）。

Conclusion: 首创开放解决方案，首次实现跨仓库神经架构规模化复用及多样性量化扩展，支持去中心化算法发现。

Abstract: Reusing existing neural-network components is central to research efficiency, yet discovering, extracting, and validating such modules across thousands of open-source repositories remains difficult. We introduce NN-RAG, a retrieval-augmented generation system that converts large, heterogeneous PyTorch codebases into a searchable and executable library of validated neural modules. Unlike conventional code search or clone-detection tools, NN-RAG performs scope-aware dependency resolution, import-preserving reconstruction, and validator-gated promotion -- ensuring that every retrieved block is scope-closed, compilable, and runnable. Applied to 19 major repositories, the pipeline extracted 1,289 candidate blocks, validated 941 (73.0%), and demonstrated that over 80% are structurally unique. Through multi-level de-duplication (exact, lexical, structural), we find that NN-RAG contributes the overwhelming majority of unique architectures to the LEMUR dataset, supplying approximately 72% of all novel network structures. Beyond quantity, NN-RAG uniquely enables cross-repository migration of architectural patterns, automatically identifying reusable modules in one project and regenerating them, dependency-complete, in another context. To our knowledge, no other open-source system provides this capability at scale. The framework's neutral specifications further allow optional integration with language models for synthesis or dataset registration without redistributing third-party code. Overall, NN-RAG transforms fragmented vision code into a reproducible, provenance-tracked substrate for algorithmic discovery, offering a first open-source solution that both quantifies and expands the diversity of executable neural architectures across repositories.

Abstract: The proliferation of face forgeries has increasingly undermined confidence in the authenticity of online content. Given the rapid development of face forgery generation algorithms, new fake categories are likely to keep appearing, posing a major challenge to existing face forgery detection methods. Despite recent advances in face forgery detection, existing methods are typically limited to binary Real-vs-Fake classification or the identification of known fake categories, and are incapable of detecting the emergence of novel types of forgeries. In this work, we study the Open Set Face Forgery Detection (OSFFD) problem, which demands that the detection model recognize novel fake categories. We reformulate the OSFFD problem and address it through uncertainty estimation, enhancing its applicability to real-world scenarios. Specifically, we propose the Dual-Level Evidential face forgery Detection (DLED) approach, which collects and fuses category-specific evidence on the spatial and frequency levels to estimate prediction uncertainty. Extensive evaluations conducted across diverse experimental settings demonstrate that the proposed DLED method achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming various baseline models by an average of 20% in detecting forgeries from novel fake categories. Moreover, on the traditional Real-versus-Fake face forgery detection task, our DLED method concurrently exhibits competitive performance.

*Kai-Po Chang,Wei-Yuan Cheng,Chi-Pin Huang,Fu-En Yang,Yu-Chiang Frank Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes the Self-Augmented Contrastive Alignment (SANTA) framework to mitigate factual hallucinations in video captioning by enhancing object and action consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal LLMs generate visually descriptive but factually inaccurate video captions, with hallucinations in both static objects and temporal actions. Current methods for image-based hallucination reduction cannot effectively address the dual challenges of spatial-temporal faithfulness in dynamic videos.

Method: SANTA introduces (1) a self-augmentation scheme to generate contrastive negative examples from potential hallucinations in the MLLM, and (2) a tracklet-phrase contrastive alignment mechanism to explicitly associate regional objects and relation-guided actions with their corresponding visual-temporal elements.

Result: The framework demonstrates superior performance over existing methods on video hallucination evaluation benchmarks, reducing both visual object and temporal action hallucinations through quantitative and qualitative experiments.

Conclusion: SANTA effectively alleviates spurious correlations in MLLMs by emphasizing visual facts during alignment, achieving enhanced faithfulness in video captioning tasks compared to prior approaches.

Abstract: Recent advancement in multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) has demonstrated their remarkable capability to generate descriptive captions for input videos. However, these models suffer from factual inaccuracies in the generated descriptions, causing severe hallucination issues. While prior works have explored alleviating hallucinations for static images, jointly mitigating visual object and temporal action hallucinations for dynamic videos remains a challenging and unsolved task. To tackle this challenge, we propose a Self-Augmented Contrastive Alignment (SANTA) framework for enabling object and action faithfulness by exempting the spurious correlations and enforcing the emphasis on visual facts. SANTA employs a hallucinative self-augmentation scheme to identify the potential hallucinations that lie in the MLLM and transform the original captions to the contrasted negatives. Furthermore, we develop a tracklet-phrase contrastive alignment to match the regional objects and relation-guided actions with their corresponding visual and temporal phrases. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SANTA outperforms existing methods in alleviating object and action hallucinations, yielding superior performance on the hallucination examination benchmarks.

### [22] [FMA-Net++: Motion- and Exposure-Aware Real-World Joint Video Super-Resolution and Deblurring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04390)
*Geunhyuk Youk,Jihyong Oh,Munchurl Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FMA-Net++ is a framework for real-world video restoration that effectively addresses motion-coupled degradation and dynamic exposure by explicitly modeling these factors through a hierarchical bidirectional architecture with exposure-aware modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video restoration methods struggle with complex degradations arising from motion combined with dynamically varying exposure (common in auto-exposure or low-light conditions). This coupled effect is often overlooked, leading to suboptimal restoration of real-world videos.

Method: FMA-Net++ employs a sequence-level architecture using Hierarchical Refinement with Bidirectional Propagation blocks for long-range temporal modeling. It introduces an Exposure Time-aware Modulation layer to condition features on per-frame exposure, driving a Flow-Guided Dynamic Filtering module. Degradation learning is decoupled from restoration, using predicted exposure- and motion-aware priors to guide restoration.

Result: FMA-Net++ achieves state-of-the-art performance on proposed REDS-ME/RE benchmarks and GoPro dataset with improved restoration accuracy, temporal consistency, and inference speed. It demonstrates strong generalization to real-world videos despite synthetic training data.

Conclusion: Explicitly modeling motion-exposure coupling via dedicated architectural components enhances video restoration quality and efficiency, enabling robust handling of complex real-world degradation scenarios under varying exposure conditions.

Abstract: Real-world video restoration is plagued by complex degradations from motion coupled with dynamically varying exposure - a key challenge largely overlooked by prior works and a common artifact of auto-exposure or low-light capture. We present FMA-Net++, a framework for joint video super-resolution and deblurring that explicitly models this coupled effect of motion and dynamically varying exposure. FMA-Net++ adopts a sequence-level architecture built from Hierarchical Refinement with Bidirectional Propagation blocks, enabling parallel, long-range temporal modeling. Within each block, an Exposure Time-aware Modulation layer conditions features on per-frame exposure, which in turn drives an exposure-aware Flow-Guided Dynamic Filtering module to infer motion- and exposure-aware degradation kernels. FMA-Net++ decouples degradation learning from restoration: the former predicts exposure- and motion-aware priors to guide the latter, improving both accuracy and efficiency. To evaluate under realistic capture conditions, we introduce REDS-ME (multi-exposure) and REDS-RE (random-exposure) benchmarks. Trained solely on synthetic data, FMA-Net++ achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and temporal consistency on our new benchmarks and GoPro, outperforming recent methods in both restoration quality and inference speed, and generalizes well to challenging real-world videos.

Motivation: 当前视觉-语言模型(VLM)的视觉表示中结构特征(域不变)和风格特征(域特异)存在隐式纠缠，限制了模型泛化能力，需要探索显式解耦策略以增强跨域适应性。

Method: 构建双路跨模态注意力机制，使用可学习表征token分别从相位谱(结构特征)和幅值谱(风格特征)提取信息，并通过非对称注入策略将其输入VLM编码器深层，强制模型学习更鲁棒的视觉-语言对齐。

Result: 在15个数据集上的实验证明该方法能有效提升模型跨域适应能力，在少样本学习场景下优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 基于傅里叶分析的视觉特征解耦方法能显著增强视觉-语言模型的泛化性能，非对称注入策略对提升模态对齐能力具有关键作用。

Abstract: Large-scale pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong few-shot learning capabilities. However, these methods typically learn holistic representations where an image's domain-invariant structure is implicitly entangled with its domain-specific style. This presents an opportunity to further enhance generalization by disentangling these visual cues. In this paper, we propose Fourier-Attentive Representation Learning (FARL), a novel framework that addresses this by explicitly disentangling visual representations using Fourier analysis. The core of our method is a dual cross-attention mechanism, where learnable representation tokens separately query an image's structural features (from the phase spectrum) and stylistic features (from the amplitude spectrum). This process yields enriched, disentangled tokens that are then injected deep into the VLM encoders to guide adaptation. Our design, which includes an asymmetric injection strategy, forces the model to learn a more robust vision-language alignment. Extensive experiments on 15 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is an effective and hardware-friendly method, which plays a key role in lightweighting remote sensing object detection. However, existing distillation methods often encounter the issue of mixed features in remote sensing images (RSIs), and neglect the discrepancies caused by subtle feature variations, leading to entangled knowledge confusion. To address these challenges, we propose an architecture-agnostic distillation method named Dual-Stream Spectral Decoupling Distillation (DS2D2) for universal remote sensing object detection tasks. Specifically, DS2D2 integrates explicit and implicit distillation grounded in spectral decomposition. Firstly, the first-order wavelet transform is applied for spectral decomposition to preserve the critical spatial characteristics of RSIs. Leveraging this spatial preservation, a Density-Independent Scale Weight (DISW) is designed to address the challenges of dense and small object detection common in RSIs. Secondly, we show implicit knowledge hidden in subtle student-teacher feature discrepancies, which significantly influence predictions when activated by detection heads. This implicit knowledge is extracted via full-frequency and high-frequency amplifiers, which map feature differences to prediction deviations. Extensive experiments on DIOR and DOTA datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Specifically, on DIOR dataset, DS2D2 achieves improvements of 4.2% in AP50 for RetinaNet and 3.8% in AP50 for Faster R-CNN, outperforming existing distillation approaches. The source code will be available at https://github.com/PolarAid/DS2D2.

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable gait analysis plays a crucial role in the early detection of Parkinsons disease (PD),yet most existing approaches remain limited by single-modality inputs, low robustness, and a lack of clinical transparency. This paper presents an explainable multimodal framework that integrates RGB and Depth (RGB-D) data to recognize Parkinsonian gait patterns under realistic conditions. The proposed system employs dual YOLOv11-based encoders for modality-specific feature extraction, followed by a Multi-Scale Local-Global Extraction (MLGE) module and a Cross-Spatial Neck Fusion mechanism to enhance spatial-temporal representation. This design captures both fine-grained limb motion (e.g., reduced arm swing) and overall gait dynamics (e.g., short stride or turning difficulty), even in challenging scenarios such as low lighting or occlusion caused by clothing. To ensure interpretability, a frozen Large Language Model (LLM) is incorporated to translate fused visual embeddings and structured metadata into clinically meaningful textual explanations. Experimental evaluations on multimodal gait datasets demonstrate that the proposed RGB-D fusion framework achieves higher recognition accuracy, improved robustness to environmental variations, and clear visual-linguistic reasoning compared with single-input baselines. By combining multimodal feature learning with language-based interpretability, this study bridges the gap between visual recognition and clinical understanding, offering a novel vision-language paradigm for reliable and explainable Parkinsons disease gait analysis.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了视频语言模型生成中的时空幻觉问题，为训练后模型优化提供了新思路，代码将于论文收录后开源。

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have shown remarkable progress in video understanding. However, these models still struggle to effectively perceive and exploit rich temporal information in videos when responding to user queries. Therefore, they often generate descriptions of events that are temporal inconsistent or causally implausible, causing severe hallucination issues. While most prior studies have focused on spatial hallucinations (e.g. object mismatches), temporal reasoning in video understanding remains relatively underexplored. To address this issue, we propose Self-Diagnostic Contrastive Decoding (SEASON), a training-free method that adaptively enhances temporal and spatial faithfulness for each output token. It achieves this by dynamically diagnosing each token's hallucination tendency and applying adaptive contrastive decoding against its corresponding temporal and spatial negatives. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SEASON outperforms all existing training-free hallucination mitigation approaches on three hallucination examination benchmarks, while further improves VideoLLMs across four general video understanding benchmarks. The code will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: End-to-End autonomous driving (E2E-AD) has emerged as a new paradigm, where trajectory planning plays a crucial role. Existing studies mainly follow two directions: trajectory generation oriented, which focuses on producing high-quality trajectories with simple decision mechanisms, and trajectory selection oriented, which performs multi-dimensional evaluation to select the best trajectory yet lacks sufficient generative capability. In this work, we propose MindDrive, a harmonized framework that integrates high-quality trajectory generation with comprehensive decision reasoning. It establishes a structured reasoning paradigm of "context simulation - candidate generation - multi-objective trade-off". In particular, the proposed Future-aware Trajectory Generator (FaTG), based on a World Action Model (WaM), performs ego-conditioned "what-if" simulations to predict potential future scenes and generate foresighted trajectory candidates. Building upon this, the VLM-oriented Evaluator (VLoE) leverages the reasoning capability of a large vision-language model to conduct multi-objective evaluations across safety, comfort, and efficiency dimensions, leading to reasoned and human-aligned decision making. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM-v1 and NAVSIM-v2 benchmarks demonstrate that MindDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance across multi-dimensional driving metrics, significantly enhancing safety, compliance, and generalization. This work provides a promising path toward interpretable and cognitively guided autonomous driving.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces DraCo, a novel method for text-to-image generation that combines textual reasoning with visual previews, enhancing planning and correction through interleaved reasoning, resulting in improved performance across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image methods rely solely on abstract textual planning or treat models as standalone generators, leading to limitations in handling complex attribute combinations and coarse-grained planning.

Method: DraCo first generates a low-resolution draft image to guide planning, then employs the model's reasoning to verify and correct semantic misalignments, followed by super-resolution refinement and specialized training with DraCo-240K and DraCo-CFG.

Result: DraCo achieves significant performance gains (+8% on GenEval, +0.91 on Imagine-Bench, +3% on GenEval++), outperforming direct generation and CoT-enhanced methods.

Conclusion: Integrating visual drafts and interleaved reasoning in text-to-image generation reduces semantic misalignments and enhances rare attribute composition, establishing a new paradigm for structured multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: Recent unified multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown impressive capabilities, incorporating chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning for enhanced text-to-image generation. However, existing approaches remain limited, either treating the model merely as a standalone generator or relying on abstract textual planning. To this end, we propose Draft-as-CoT (DraCo), a novel interleaved reasoning paradigm that fully leverages both textual and visual contents in CoT for better planning and verification. Our method first generates a low-resolution draft image as preview, providing more concrete and structural visual planning and guidance. Then, we employ the model's inherent understanding capability to verify potential semantic misalignments between the draft and input prompt, and performs refinement through selective corrections with super-resolution. In this way, our approach addresses two fundamental challenges: the coarse-grained nature of textual planning and the difficulty in generating rare attribute combinations. To support training, we curate DraCo-240K, aiming to enhance three atomic capabilities spanning general correction, instance manipulation, and layout reorganization. Supported by DraCo-CFG, a specialized classifier-free guidance (CFG) strategy for interleaved reasoning, DraCo achieves a tremendous increase on GenEval (+8%), Imagine-Bench (+0.91), and GenEval++ (+3%), significantly outperforming direct generation and other generation methods empowered by CoT.

TL;DR: 提出了StreamEQA，首个面向具身场景下的流视频问答基准测试，用于评估模型在持续视觉输入下的感知、推理与动态规划能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着具身智能走向实际应用，需要模型能持续处理流视频并结合历史、当前和未来信息进行决策。现有基准测试无法有效评估这一能力。

Method: 构建包含156个长视频、42项任务和21K问题的数据集，从具身（感知、交互、规划）和流式（回溯、实时、前向推理）两个维度分类问题，并通过自动化与人工结合的生成流程确保质量。

Result: 现有13种视频大语言模型在传统基准表现优异，但在流视频理解上表现欠佳，尤其在高阶推理和时间连续性任务上存在显著差距。

Conclusion: StreamEQA揭示了当前模型在连续视觉推理和长期时间建模中的不足，并为具身智能的流视频理解研究提供了标准化评估框架。

Abstract: As embodied intelligence advances toward real-world deployment, the ability to continuously perceive and reason over streaming visual inputs becomes essential. In such settings, an agent must maintain situational awareness of its environment, comprehend the interactions with surrounding entities, and dynamically plan actions informed by past observations, current contexts, and anticipated future events. To facilitate progress in this direction, we introduce StreamEQA, the first benchmark designed for streaming video question answering in embodied scenarios. StreamEQA evaluates existing MLLMs along two orthogonal dimensions: Embodied and Streaming. Along the embodied dimension, we categorize the questions into three levels: perception, interaction, and planning, which progressively assess a model's ability to recognize fine-grained visual details, reason about agent-object interactions, and perform high-level goal-directed reasoning. For the streaming dimension, questions are divided into backward, real-time, and forward reasoning, with each mode relying on a distinct temporal context. Built upon 156 independent long videos, StreamEQA defines 42 tasks and generates approximately 21K question-answer pairs with precise timestamps through a hybrid pipeline combining automated generation and human refinement. Evaluations of 13 state-of-the-art video-LLMs reveal that, despite strong performance on conventional benchmarks, these models still struggle with streaming video understanding in embodied scenarios. We hope StreamEQA will catalyze research on streaming video understanding for embodied applications.

Conclusion: 通过单对指导机制和噪声预测优化，有效解决了真实噪声数据获取成本高与模型泛化能力弱的问题，代码开源促进了方法实用化。

Abstract: Recent image denoising methods have leveraged generative modeling for real noise synthesis to address the costly acquisition of real-world noisy data. However, these generative models typically require camera metadata and extensive target-specific noisy-clean image pairs, often showing limited generalization between settings. In this paper, to mitigate the prerequisites, we propose a Single-Pair Guided Diffusion for generalized noise synthesis GuidNoise, which uses a single noisy/clean pair as the guidance, often easily obtained by itself within a training set. To train GuidNoise, which generates synthetic noisy images from the guidance, we introduce a guidance-aware affine feature modification (GAFM) and a noise-aware refine loss to leverage the inherent potential of diffusion models. This loss function refines the diffusion model's backward process, making the model more adept at generating realistic noise distributions. The GuidNoise synthesizes high-quality noisy images under diverse noise environments without additional metadata during both training and inference. Additionally, GuidNoise enables the efficient generation of noisy-clean image pairs at inference time, making synthetic noise readily applicable for augmenting training data. This self-augmentation significantly improves denoising performance, especially in practical scenarios with lightweight models and limited training data.

Conclusion: 扩散模型具备双向建模能力，可作为自动驾驶端到端系统的可靠可扩展路径，未来可能拓展至多任务具身智能领域。

Abstract: The autonomous driving community is increasingly focused on addressing the challenges posed by out-of-distribution (OOD) driving scenarios. A dominant research trend seeks to enhance end-to-end (E2E) driving systems by integrating vision-language models (VLMs), leveraging their rich world knowledge and reasoning abilities to improve generalization across diverse environments. However, most existing VLMs or vision-language agents (VLAs) are built upon autoregressive (AR) models. In this paper, we observe that existing AR-based VLMs -- limited by causal attention and sequential token generation -- often fail to maintain consistency and controllability between high-level reasoning and low-level planning. In contrast, recent discrete diffusion VLMs equipped with bidirectional attention exhibit superior controllability and reliability through iterative denoising. Building on these observations, we introduce dVLM-AD, a diffusion-based vision-language model that unifies perception, structured reasoning, and low-level planning for end-to-end driving. Evaluated on nuScenes and WOD-E2E, dVLM-AD yields more consistent reasoning-action pairs and achieves planning performance comparable to existing driving VLM/VLA systems despite a modest backbone, outperforming AR-based baselines with a 9 percent improvement in behavior-trajectory consistency and a 6 percent increase in RFS on long-tail WOD-E2E scenarios. These results suggest a controllable and reliable pathway for scalable end-to-end driving.

Conclusion: 基于流匹配的UniTS实现了遥感时序任务的统一建模，通过ACor和STM提升条件控制生成能力，为多模态时间序列分析提供了通用解决方案。

Abstract: One of the primary objectives of satellite remote sensing is to capture the complex dynamics of the Earth environment, which encompasses tasks such as reconstructing continuous cloud-free time series images, detecting land cover changes, and forecasting future surface evolution. However, existing methods typically require specialized models tailored to different tasks, lacking unified modeling of spatiotemporal features across multiple time series tasks. In this paper, we propose a Unified Time Series Generative Model (UniTS), a general framework applicable to various time series tasks, including time series reconstruction, time series cloud removal, time series semantic change detection, and time series forecasting. Based on the flow matching generative paradigm, UniTS constructs a deterministic evolution path from noise to targets under the guidance of task-specific conditions, achieving unified modeling of spatiotemporal representations for multiple tasks. The UniTS architecture consists of a diffusion transformer with spatio-temporal blocks, where we design an Adaptive Condition Injector (ACor) to enhance the model's conditional perception of multimodal inputs, enabling high-quality controllable generation. Additionally, we design a Spatiotemporal-aware Modulator (STM) to improve the ability of spatio-temporal blocks to capture complex spatiotemporal dependencies. Furthermore, we construct two high-quality multimodal time series datasets, TS-S12 and TS-S12CR, filling the gap of benchmark datasets for time series cloud removal and forecasting tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniTS exhibits exceptional generative and cognitive capabilities in both low-level and high-level time series tasks. It significantly outperforms existing methods, particularly when facing challenges such as severe cloud contamination, modality absence, and forecasting phenological variations.

Result: 在UCF-101数据集上rFVD指标超越LARP 25%，并在K600帧预测和UCF-101条件生成任务中刷新SOTA，验证了模型在自回归视频生成场景的有效性。

Conclusion: 时空解耦设计与梯度对齐机制有效提升视频分词器性能，为视频生成任务提供了更优的基础架构。

Abstract: This paper presents DeRA, a novel 1D video tokenizer that decouples the spatial-temporal representation learning in video tokenization to achieve better training efficiency and performance. Specifically, DeRA maintains a compact 1D latent space while factorizing video encoding into appearance and motion streams, which are aligned with pretrained vision foundation models to capture the spatial semantics and temporal dynamics in videos separately. To address the gradient conflicts introduced by the heterogeneous supervision, we further propose the Symmetric Alignment-Conflict Projection (SACP) module that proactively reformulates gradients by suppressing the components along conflicting directions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeRA outperforms LARP, the previous state-of-the-art video tokenizer by 25% on UCF-101 in terms of rFVD. Moreover, using DeRA for autoregressive video generation, we also achieve new state-of-the-art results on both UCF-101 class-conditional generation and K600 frame prediction.

TL;DR: 提出NABLA数据集评估鸟类图像生成中的身份保持性能，并发现基于细粒度属性的分组训练可提升效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有零样本图像生成模型在非刚性物体（如鸟类）的身份保持上存在局限，且缺乏高质量细粒度数据导致评估与改进困难。

Method: 构建包含4759对专家筛选图像的NABLA数据集，结合iNaturalist多图观察对和少量视频形成基准。采用按物种/年龄/性别的分组训练策略验证效果。

Result: 当前SOTA基线模型在NABLA数据集上均无法有效保持身份一致性；分组训练策略显著提升新旧物种的生成准确率。

Conclusion: 细粒度领域（如鸟类）对身份保持生成模型提出更高挑战，NABLA为该方向提供可靠基准，验证属性分组训练的作用。

Abstract: Since the advent of controllable image generation, increasingly rich modes of control have enabled greater customization and accessibility for everyday users. Zero-shot, identity-preserving models such as Insert Anything and OminiControl now support applications like virtual try-on without requiring additional fine-tuning. While these models may be fitting for humans and rigid everyday objects, they still have limitations for non-rigid or fine-grained categories. These domains often lack accessible, high-quality data -- especially videos or multi-view observations of the same subject -- making them difficult both to evaluate and to improve upon. Yet, such domains are essential for moving beyond content creation toward applications that demand accuracy and fine detail. Birds are an excellent domain for this task: they exhibit high diversity, require fine-grained cues for identification, and come in a wide variety of poses. We introduce the NABirds Look-Alikes (NABLA) dataset, consisting of 4,759 expert-curated image pairs. Together with 1,073 pairs collected from multi-image observations on iNaturalist and a small set of videos, this forms a benchmark for evaluating identity-preserving generation of birds. We show that state-of-the-art baselines fail to maintain identity on this dataset, and we demonstrate that training on images grouped by species, age, and sex -- used as a proxy for identity -- substantially improves performance on both seen and unseen species.

TL;DR: UltraImage addresses content repetition and quality degradation in high-resolution image generation via diffusion transformers by analyzing positional embeddings' frequency periodicity and introducing recursive dominant frequency correction and entropy-guided attention concentration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image diffusion transformers face limitations in generating images beyond training resolutions, leading to repetitive content and reduced quality. The authors aim to enable reliable high-resolution image generation by addressing these fundamental issues through positional embedding analysis and attention mechanism improvements.

Method: Through frequency-wise analysis of positional embeddings, they identified periodicity-induced repetition matching training resolution. A recursive dominant frequency correction was developed to constrain periodicity during extrapolation. For quality degradation caused by diluted attention, entropy-guided adaptive attention concentration was proposed to dynamically adjust focus on local details and global structure.

Result: UltraImage achieved state-of-the-art performance on Qwen-Image and Flux datasets (up to 4K resolution), with reduced content repetition and improved visual fidelity. It demonstrated unprecedented extrapolation capability by generating 6K×6K images from 1328p training resolution without low-resolution guidance.

Conclusion: This work advances diffusion transformer capabilities for extreme image resolution extrapolation by addressing positional embedding periodicity and attention degradation issues through two theoretically-supported technical innovations.

Abstract: Recent image diffusion transformers achieve high-fidelity generation, but struggle to generate images beyond these scales, suffering from content repetition and quality degradation. In this work, we present UltraImage, a principled framework that addresses both issues. Through frequency-wise analysis of positional embeddings, we identify that repetition arises from the periodicity of the dominant frequency, whose period aligns with the training resolution. We introduce a recursive dominant frequency correction to constrain it within a single period after extrapolation. Furthermore, we find that quality degradation stems from diluted attention and thus propose entropy-guided adaptive attention concentration, which assigns higher focus factors to sharpen local attention for fine detail and lower ones to global attention patterns to preserve structural consistency. Experiments show that UltraImage consistently outperforms prior methods on Qwen-Image and Flux (around 4K) across three generation scenarios, reducing repetition and improving visual fidelity. Moreover, UltraImage can generate images up to 6K*6K without low-resolution guidance from a training resolution of 1328p, demonstrating its extreme extrapolation capability.

Conclusion: DuGI-MAE通过解决红外图像关键挑战（信息保留、全局建模和噪声抑制），为红外视觉任务提供了有效的基础模型，构建的Inf-590K数据集促进了红外AI模型的发展。

Abstract: Infrared imaging plays a critical role in low-light and adverse weather conditions. However, due to the distinct characteristics of infrared images, existing foundation models such as Masked Autoencoder (MAE) trained on visible data perform suboptimal in infrared image interpretation tasks. To bridge this gap, an infrared foundation model known as InfMAE was developed and pre-trained on large-scale infrared datasets. Despite its effectiveness, InfMAE still faces several limitations, including the omission of informative tokens, insufficient modeling of global associations, and neglect of non-uniform noise. In this paper, we propose a Dual-domain Guided Infrared foundation model based on MAE (DuGI-MAE). First, we design a deterministic masking strategy based on token entropy, preserving only high-entropy tokens for reconstruction to enhance informativeness. Next, we introduce a Dual-Domain Guidance (DDG) module, which simultaneously captures global token relationships and adaptively filters non-uniform background noise commonly present in infrared imagery. To facilitate large-scale pretraining, we construct Inf-590K, a comprehensive infrared image dataset encompassing diverse scenes, various target types, and multiple spatial resolutions. Pretrained on Inf-590K, DuGI-MAE demonstrates strong generalization capabilities across various downstream tasks, including infrared object detection, semantic segmentation, and small target detection. Experimental results validate the superiority of the proposed method over both supervised and self-supervised comparison methods. Our code is available in the supplementary material.

Conclusion: 为具身智能的可扩展世界模型构建提供了新范式，未来可扩展到多模态和强化学习场景。

Abstract: Generating long, coherent egocentric videos is difficult, as hand-object interactions and procedural tasks require reliable long-term memory. Existing autoregressive models suffer from content drift, where object identity and scene semantics degrade over time. To address this challenge, we introduce EgoLCD, an end-to-end framework for egocentric long-context video generation that treats long video synthesis as a problem of efficient and stable memory management. EgoLCD combines a Long-Term Sparse KV Cache for stable global context with an attention-based short-term memory, extended by LoRA for local adaptation. A Memory Regulation Loss enforces consistent memory usage, and Structured Narrative Prompting provides explicit temporal guidance. Extensive experiments on the EgoVid-5M benchmark demonstrate that EgoLCD achieves state-of-the-art performance in both perceptual quality and temporal consistency, effectively mitigating generative forgetting and representing a significant step toward building scalable world models for embodied AI.

Conclusion: 无需参数更新和源数据的BA-TTA-SAM框架，有效解决医学图像分割中的域迁移问题，为零样本模型自适应提供了新范式。

Abstract: Due to the scarcity of annotated data and the substantial computational costs of model, conventional tuning methods in medical image segmentation face critical challenges. Current approaches to adapting pretrained models, including full-parameter and parameter-efficient fine-tuning, still rely heavily on task-specific training on downstream tasks. Therefore, zero-shot segmentation has gained increasing attention, especially with foundation models such as SAM demonstrating promising generalization capabilities. However, SAM still faces notable limitations on medical datasets due to domain shifts, making efficient zero-shot enhancement an urgent research goal. To address these challenges, we propose BA-TTA-SAM, a task-agnostic test-time adaptation framework that significantly enhances the zero-shot segmentation performance of SAM via test-time adaptation. This framework integrates two key mechanisms: (1) The encoder-level Gaussian prompt injection embeds Gaussian-based prompts directly into the image encoder, providing explicit guidance for initial representation learning. (2) The cross-layer boundary-aware attention alignment exploits the hierarchical feature interactions within the ViT backbone, aligning deep semantic responses with shallow boundary cues. Experiments on four datasets, including ISIC, Kvasir, BUSI, and REFUGE, show an average improvement of 12.4\% in the DICE score compared with SAM's zero-shot segmentation performance. The results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in medical image segmentation. Our framework significantly enhances the generalization ability of SAM, without requiring any source-domain training data. Extensive experiments on publicly available medical datasets strongly demonstrate the superiority of our framework. Our code is available at https://github.com/Emilychenlin/BA-TTA-SAM.

Abstract: Traditional high-quality 3D scanning and reconstruction typically relies on human labor to plan the scanning procedure. With the rapid development of embodied systems such as drones and robots, there is a growing demand of performing accurate 3D scanning and reconstruction in an fully automated manner. We introduce Auto3R, a data-driven uncertainty quantification model that is designed to automate the 3D scanning and reconstruction of scenes and objects, including objects with non-lambertian and specular materials. Specifically, in a process of iterative 3D reconstruction and scanning, Auto3R can make efficient and accurate prediction of uncertainty distribution over potential scanning viewpoints, without knowing the ground truth geometry and appearance. Through extensive experiments, Auto3R achieves superior performance that outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. We also deploy Auto3R on a robot arm equipped with a camera and demonstrate that Auto3R can be used to effectively digitize real-world 3D objects and delivers ready-to-use and photorealistic digital assets.

Conclusion: 显式物理建模能有效增强视频理解能力，该框架在无监督物理学习和模型表征扩展性方面具备优势。

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs) have shown impressive performance across a wide range of video-language tasks. However, they often fail in scenarios requiring a deeper understanding of physical dynamics. This limitation primarily arises from their reliance on appearance-based matching. Incorporating physical motion modeling is crucial for deeper video understanding, but presents three key challenges: (1) motion signals are often entangled with appearance variations, making it difficult to extract clean physical cues; (2) effective motion modeling requires not only continuous-time motion representations but also capturing physical dynamics; and (3) collecting accurate annotations for physical attributes is costly and often impractical. To address these issues, we propose PhyVLLM, a physical-guided video-language framework that explicitly incorporates physical motion into Video LLMs. Specifically, PhyVLLM disentangles visual appearance and object motion through a dual-branch encoder. To model physical dynamics over time, we incorporate a Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (Neural ODE) module, which generates differentiable physical dynamic representations. The resulting motion-aware representations are projected into the token space of a pretrained LLM, enabling physics reasoning without compromising the model's original multimodal capabilities. To circumvent the need for explicit physical labels, PhyVLLM employs a self-supervised manner to model the continuous evolution of object motion. Experimental results demonstrate that PhyVLLM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art Video LLMs on both physical reasoning and general video understanding tasks, highlighting the advantages of incorporating explicit physical modeling.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升机器人视频生成质量，为具身智能提供可靠数据基础，推动人形机器人发展。

Abstract: The advancement of embodied AI has unlocked significant potential for intelligent humanoid robots. However, progress in both Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models and world models is severely hampered by the scarcity of large-scale, diverse training data. A promising solution is to "robotize" web-scale human videos, which has been proven effective for policy training. However, these solutions mainly "overlay" robot arms to egocentric videos, which cannot handle complex full-body motions and scene occlusions in third-person videos, making them unsuitable for robotizing humans. To bridge this gap, we introduce X-Humanoid, a generative video editing approach that adapts the powerful Wan 2.2 model into a video-to-video structure and finetunes it for the human-to-humanoid translation task. This finetuning requires paired human-humanoid videos, so we designed a scalable data creation pipeline, turning community assets into 17+ hours of paired synthetic videos using Unreal Engine. We then apply our trained model to 60 hours of the Ego-Exo4D videos, generating and releasing a new large-scale dataset of over 3.6 million "robotized" humanoid video frames. Quantitative analysis and user studies confirm our method's superiority over existing baselines: 69% of users rated it best for motion consistency, and 62.1% for embodiment correctness.

Motivation: 由于现有视觉语言模型（VLMs）在长期上下文维护和计算效率上的不足，超长视频理解存在重大挑战。传统检索增强生（RAG）系统虽有尝试但计算开销巨大，亟需更高效的解决方案。

Method: VideoMem提出一种自适应全局内存缓冲机制，动态保留关键信息并丢弃冗余内容，并通过结合渐进分组相对策略优化（PRPO）算法中的状态传播策略（PSP）和时序级联奖励（TCR）模块，优化长程训练效率。

Conclusion: 该研究证明了动态内存管理与渐进优化策略对超长视频理解的有效性，为视频分析领域提供了新的技术路径。

Abstract: Ultra long video understanding remains an open challenge, as existing vision language models (VLMs) falter on such content due to limited context length and inefficient long term memory retention. To address this, recent works have attempted to construct external knowledge bases and corresponding retrieval agumented generation (RAG) systems, yet these incur enormous storage and computational overhead. In this paper, we propose VideoMem, a novel framework that pioneers models long video understanding as a sequential generation task via adaptive memory management. Specifically, VideoMem dynamically updates a global memory buffer, which adaptively retains critical information while discarding redundant content across the video timeline. To efficiently train VLMs for such long-term tasks, VideoMem integrates the Progressive Grouped Relative Policy Optimization (PRPO) algorithm, equipped with two core modules: Progressive State Propagation (PSP) adaptively retains valid current states, propagates them to the next rollout step, and gradually narrows the model exploration space. Temporal Cascading Reward (TCR) further alleviates reward sparsity, improving sample utilization and accelerating convergence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VideoMem significantly outperforms existing open-source models across diverse benchmarks for ultra-long video understanding tasks.

*Hong Kuang,Jianchen Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces GEF, a method for 3D Gaussian Splatting that improves surface reconstruction accuracy through entropy minimization and regularization, achieving state-of-the-art results on 3D reconstruction benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offers high rendering efficiency for novel view synthesis, but achieving precise surface reconstruction remains challenging. The paper addresses this by leveraging the insight that well-reconstructed surfaces naturally exhibit low configurational entropy, where dominant primitives define geometry while redundant components are suppressed.

Method: Three key contributions: (1) Entropy-driven surface modeling via entropy minimization; (2) Adaptive spatial regularization using Surface Neighborhood Redundancy Index (SNRI) and entropy-guided weighting; (3) Multi-scale geometric preservation through cross-scale entropy alignment.

Result: GEF achieved superior performance on DTU (Chamfer Distance: 0.64) and T&T benchmarks (F1 score: 0.44), with best-in-class SSIM (0.855) and LPIPS (0.136) on Mip-NeRF 360, balancing geometric precision and photometric fidelity.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates that entropy-based optimization enhances surface reconstruction accuracy without sacrificing rendering quality, establishing GEF as a competitive method for 3DGS in novel view synthesis tasks.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a leading technique for novel view synthesis, demonstrating exceptional rendering efficiency. \replaced[]{Well-reconstructed surfaces can be characterized by low configurational entropy, where dominant primitives clearly define surface geometry while redundant components are suppressed.}{The key insight is that well-reconstructed surfaces naturally exhibit low configurational entropy, where dominant primitives clearly define surface geometry while suppressing redundant components.} Three complementary technical contributions are introduced: (1) entropy-driven surface modeling via entropy minimization for low configurational entropy in primitive distributions; (2) adaptive spatial regularization using the Surface Neighborhood Redundancy Index (SNRI) and image entropy-guided weighting; (3) multi-scale geometric preservation through competitive cross-scale entropy alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GEF achieves competitive geometric precision on DTU and T\&T benchmarks, while delivering superior rendering quality compared to existing methods on Mip-NeRF 360. Notably, superior Chamfer Distance (0.64) on DTU and F1 score (0.44) on T\&T are obtained, alongside the best SSIM (0.855) and LPIPS (0.136) among baselines on Mip-NeRF 360, validating the framework's ability to enhance surface reconstruction accuracy without compromising photometric fidelity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文研究了文档视觉问答（DocVQA）模型易受对抗攻击的问题，提出了一种在视觉上难以察觉但语义上有针对性的文档内容篡改攻击方法，并证明当前先进模型（如Pix2Struct和Donut）存在严重漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DocVQA模型虽然表现出色，但缺乏对视觉-语义对抗攻击的安全性研究，攻击者可能通过隐蔽手段诱导模型生成错误答案（如散布虚假信息或引发系统性失效），亟需识别其脆弱性并推动防御技术发展。

Method: 设计了一种结合视觉和文本的对抗攻击算法，既能保持文档外观不变（避免人眼察觉），又可通过语义修改控制模型输出。具体包括：1）针对性篡改（例如更改数字或关键词）；2）全局攻击模式（系统性破坏模型性能），并通过梯度优化技术在图像和文本空间同步实施攻击。

Result: 实验表明攻击方法在两个SOTA模型（Pix2Struct和Donut）上均取得显著效果：针对目标答案的攻击成功率达60%-90%，且部分篡改仅需1%的图像区域即可实现。攻击不仅导致特定错误，还可能使模型整体准确率下降20%-47%。

Conclusion: 当前DocVQA系统在视觉-语义一致性方面存在根本性安全隐患，现有架构难以防御隐蔽的对抗性欺诈。建议未来研究需加强多模态鲁棒性验证，并开发联合视觉-文本对抗训练机制以提升安全性。

Abstract: Document Visual Question Answering (DocVQA) enables end-to-end reasoning grounded on information present in a document input. While recent models have shown impressive capabilities, they remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In this work, we introduce a novel attack scenario that aims to forge document content in a visually imperceptible yet semantically targeted manner, allowing an adversary to induce specific or generally incorrect answers from a DocVQA model. We develop specialized attack algorithms that can produce adversarially forged documents tailored to different attackers' goals, ranging from targeted misinformation to systematic model failure scenarios. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach against two end-to-end state-of-the-art models: Pix2Struct, a vision-language transformer that jointly processes image and text through sequence-to-sequence modeling, and Donut, a transformer-based model that directly extracts text and answers questions from document images. Our findings highlight critical vulnerabilities in current DocVQA systems and call for the development of more robust defenses.

TL;DR: 本文提出了COOPER模型，通过结合RGB输入与深度和分割辅助模态，并采用两阶段训练策略，实现了多模态大语言模型的空间感知与推理能力的统一增强。实验表明，该模型在空间推理任务上平均提升了6.91%，验证了辅助模态生成对空间理解的促进作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MLLM在3D空间推理能力上存在不足，且现有方法要么仅增强感知（如添加辅助模态），要么单独改进推理（如空间VQA训练），未能有机结合感知与推理过程。研究旨在探索统一框架下如何通过自适应推理机制提升空间智能。

Method: 构建名为COOPER的统一MLLM，其核心方法包括：(1) 集成RGB、深度与分割模态构建多模态输入；(2) 双阶段训练策略：第一阶段训练辅助模态生成能力，第二阶段通过交替推理机制融合感知与推理；(3) 采用监督学习与强化学习相结合的训练方法。

Result: COOPER模型在空间推理任务中达到6.91%的平均提升，保持通用性能的同时显著优化空间理解。仅进行辅助模态生成训练的变体，在距离和尺度估计任务中仍获得7.92%的性能增益，验证了模态生成对空间知识内化的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过整合感知增强与自适应推理机制，统一MLLM能够有效提升空间智能。生成辅助模态的过程可帮助模型内部化空间知识，证明了多模态联合训练对复杂推理任务的价值。本研究为构建具身化空间理解能力的AI系统提供了新路径。

Abstract: Visual Spatial Reasoning is crucial for enabling Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to understand object properties and spatial relationships, yet current models still struggle with 3D-aware reasoning. Existing approaches typically enhance either perception, by augmenting RGB inputs with auxiliary modalities such as depth and segmentation, or reasoning, by training on spatial VQA datasets and applying reinforcement learning, and thus treat these two aspects in isolation. In this work, we investigate whether a unified MLLM can develop an intrinsic ability to enhance spatial perception and, through adaptive interleaved reasoning, achieve stronger spatial intelligence. We propose \textbf{COOPER}, a unified MLLM that leverages depth and segmentation as auxiliary modalities and is trained in two stages to acquire auxiliary modality generation and adaptive, interleaved reasoning capabilities. COOPER achieves an average \textbf{6.91\%} improvement in spatial reasoning while maintaining general performance. Moreover, even a variant trained only for auxiliary modality generation attains a \textbf{7.92\%} gain on distance and size estimation, suggesting that learning to generate auxiliary modalities helps internalize spatial knowledge and strengthen spatial understanding.

Abstract: Supervised deep learning (DL) receives great interest for automated analysis of microscopic images with an increasing body of literature supporting its potential. The development and validation of those DL models relies heavily on the availability of high-quality, large-scale datasets. However, creating such datasets is a complex and resource-intensive process, often hindered by challenges such as time constraints, domain variability, and risks of bias in image collection and label creation. This review provides a comprehensive guide to the critical steps in dataset creation, including: 1) image acquisition, 2) selection of annotation software, and 3) annotation creation. In addition to ensuring a sufficiently large number of images, it is crucial to address sources of image variability (domain shifts) - such as those related to slide preparation and digitization - that could lead to algorithmic errors if not adequately represented in the training data. Key quality criteria for annotations are the three "C"s: correctness, completeness, and consistency. This review explores methods to enhance annotation quality through the use of advanced techniques that mitigate the limitations of single annotators. To support dataset creators, a standard operating procedure (SOP) is provided as supplemental material, outlining best practices for dataset development. Furthermore, the article underscores the importance of open datasets in driving innovation and enhancing reproducibility of DL research. By addressing the challenges and offering practical recommendations, this review aims to advance the creation of and availability to high-quality, large-scale datasets, ultimately contributing to the development of generalizable and robust DL models for pathology applications.

Conclusion: 通过物理启发式特征解耦，实现低辐射剂量下的精准肿瘤诊断

Abstract: Tumor segmentation and diagnosis in contrast-enhanced Computed Tomography (CT) rely heavily on the physiological dynamics of contrast agents. However, obtaining a complete multi-phase series is often clinically unfeasible due to radiation concerns or scanning limitations, leading to the "missing modality" problem. Existing deep learning approaches typically treat missing phases as absent independent channels, ignoring the inherent temporal continuity of hemodynamics. In this work, we propose Time Attenuated Representation Disentanglement (TARDis), a novel physics-aware framework that redefines missing modalities as missing sample points on a continuous Time-Attenuation Curve. TARDis explicitly disentangles the latent feature space into a time-invariant static component (anatomy) and a time-dependent dynamic component (perfusion). We achieve this via a dual-path architecture: a quantization-based path using a learnable embedding dictionary to extract consistent anatomical structures, and a probabilistic path using a Conditional Variational Autoencoder to model dynamic enhancement conditioned on the estimated scan time. This design allows the network to hallucinate missing hemodynamic features by sampling from the learned latent distribution. Extensive experiments on a large-scale private abdominal CT dataset (2,282 cases) and two public datasets demonstrate that TARDis significantly outperforms state-of-the-art incomplete modality frameworks. Notably, our method maintains robust diagnostic performance even in extreme data-sparsity scenarios, highlighting its potential for reducing radiation exposure while maintaining diagnostic precision.

Motivation: 现有EQA基准默认必须回答所有问题，但实际场景中智能体需具备判断信息是否充足的拒答能力，研究旨在填补此关键能力缺口。

Method: 通过分析500个真实问题发现32.4%存在信息缺失，构建包含五个拒答类别（行动限制/指称模糊等）的理论框架，并基于OpenEQA扩展包含1,636对原始-模糊问题的AbstainEQA数据集。

Result: 最先进模型在AbstainEQA上仅达42.79%拒答召回率，而人类表现高达91.17%，且模型优化策略如扩展规模、提示工程等效果有限。

Conclusion: 拒答能力是构建可靠具身交互系统的基础前提，当前模型需突破性改进方能实现有效人机协作，研究为未来EQA系统评估设定了新标准。

Abstract: Embodied Question Answering (EQA) requires an agent to interpret language, perceive its environment, and navigate within 3D scenes to produce responses. Existing EQA benchmarks assume that every question must be answered, but embodied agents should know when they do not have sufficient information to answer. In this work, we focus on a minimal requirement for EQA agents, abstention: knowing when to withhold an answer. From an initial study of 500 human queries, we find that 32.4% contain missing or underspecified context. Drawing on this initial study and cognitive theories of human communication errors, we derive five representative categories requiring abstention: actionability limitation, referential underspecification, preference dependence, information unavailability, and false presupposition. We augment OpenEQA by having annotators transform well-posed questions into ambiguous variants outlined by these categories. The resulting dataset, AbstainEQA, comprises 1,636 annotated abstention cases paired with 1,636 original OpenEQA instances for balanced evaluation. Evaluating on AbstainEQA, we find that even the best frontier model only attains 42.79% abstention recall, while humans achieve 91.17%. We also find that scaling, prompting, and reasoning only yield marginal gains, and that fine-tuned models overfit to textual cues. Together, these results position abstention as a fundamental prerequisite for reliable interaction in embodied settings and as a necessary basis for effective clarification.

Motivation: 传统图像级NSFW标志无法满足非法内容检测需求，需识别具体违法物体及其位置，但现有方法在准确率、细粒度和对抗攻击鲁棒性方面存在不足。

Result: 在790张标注数据集上达到85.8%元素级召回率、78.1%精确率、92.1%分割成功率，较直接零样本VLM定位提升27.4%召回率，对抗扰动下性能下降不超过10%。处理速度达秒级。

Conclusion: 该方法是首个实现精细化、可解释的恶意图像检测工具，在保持高精度的同时具有强抗攻击能力，可无缝接入现有VLM工作流。

Abstract: Detecting illicit visual content demands more than image-level NSFW flags; moderators must also know what objects make an image illegal and where those objects occur. We introduce a zero-shot pipeline that simultaneously (i) detects if an image contains harmful content, (ii) identifies each critical element involved, and (iii) localizes those elements with pixel-accurate masks - all in one pass. The system first applies foundation segmentation model (SAM) to generate candidate object masks and refines them into larger independent regions. Each region is scored for malicious relevance by a vision-language model using open-vocabulary prompts; these scores weight a fusion step that produces a consolidated malicious object map. An ensemble across multiple segmenters hardens the pipeline against adaptive attacks that target any single segmentation method. Evaluated on a newly-annotated 790-image dataset spanning drug, sexual, violent and extremist content, our method attains 85.8% element-level recall, 78.1% precision and a 92.1% segment-success rate - exceeding direct zero-shot VLM localization by 27.4% recall at comparable precision. Against PGD adversarial perturbations crafted to break SAM and VLM, our method's precision and recall decreased by no more than 10%, demonstrating high robustness against attacks. The full pipeline processes an image in seconds, plugs seamlessly into existing VLM workflows, and constitutes the first practical tool for fine-grained, explainable malicious-image moderation.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce HeFT (Head-Frequency Tracker), a zero-shot point tracking framework that leverages the visual priors of pretrained video diffusion models. To better understand how they encode spatiotemporal information, we analyze the internal representations of Video Diffusion Transformer (VDiT). Our analysis reveals that attention heads act as minimal functional units with distinct specializations for matching, semantic understanding, and positional encoding. Additionally, we find that the low-frequency components in VDiT features are crucial for establishing correspondences, whereas the high-frequency components tend to introduce noise. Building on these insights, we propose a head- and frequency-aware feature selection strategy that jointly selects the most informative attention head and low-frequency components to enhance tracking performance. Specifically, our method extracts discriminative features through single-step denoising, applies feature selection, and employs soft-argmax localization with forward-backward consistency checks for correspondence estimation. Extensive experiments on TAP-Vid benchmarks demonstrate that HeFT achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot tracking performance, approaching the accuracy of supervised methods while eliminating the need for annotated training data. Our work further underscores the promise of video diffusion models as powerful foundation models for a wide range of downstream tasks, paving the way toward unified visual foundation models.

Abstract: Existing diffusion-based video generation methods are fundamentally constrained by sequential computation and long-horizon inconsistency, limiting their practical adoption in real-time, streaming audio-driven avatar synthesis. We present Live Avatar, an algorithm-system co-designed framework that enables efficient, high-fidelity, and infinite-length avatar generation using a 14-billion-parameter diffusion model. Our approach introduces Timestep-forcing Pipeline Parallelism (TPP), a distributed inference paradigm that pipelines denoising steps across multiple GPUs, effectively breaking the autoregressive bottleneck and ensuring stable, low-latency real-time streaming. To further enhance temporal consistency and mitigate identity drift and color artifacts, we propose the Rolling Sink Frame Mechanism (RSFM), which maintains sequence fidelity by dynamically recalibrating appearance using a cached reference image. Additionally, we leverage Self-Forcing Distribution Matching Distillation to facilitate causal, streamable adaptation of large-scale models without sacrificing visual quality. Live Avatar demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, reaching 20 FPS end-to-end generation on 5 H800 GPUs, and, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to achieve practical, real-time, high-fidelity avatar generation at this scale. Our work establishes a new paradigm for deploying advanced diffusion models in industrial long-form video synthesis applications.

TL;DR: 本文提出Reward Forcing框架，通过EMA-Sink和Re-DMD方法解决视频生成中初始帧依赖和动态质量下降问题，实现实时高质量视频生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成方法使用滑动窗口注意力机制，导致初始帧过度依赖和动态效果下降，需在保持性能的同时降低初始帧影响并提升动态质量。

Method: 1. EMA-Sink：初始帧token通过滑动窗口外token指数移动平均持续更新，保持长期一致性且避免初始帧复制。2. Re-DMD：基于视觉语言模型评分的奖励机制，优先优化高动态样本的分布匹配。

Result: 在标准基准测试达到SOTA，单H100 GPU实现23.1 FPS流视频生成，生成视频动态质量显著提升且忠实度高。

Conclusion: EMA-Sink通过动态token更新平衡长期依赖与实时动态，Re-DMD利用奖励机制提升模型动态感知能力，二者结合实现高效视频生成。

Abstract: Efficient streaming video generation is critical for simulating interactive and dynamic worlds. Existing methods distill few-step video diffusion models with sliding window attention, using initial frames as sink tokens to maintain attention performance and reduce error accumulation. However, video frames become overly dependent on these static tokens, resulting in copied initial frames and diminished motion dynamics. To address this, we introduce Reward Forcing, a novel framework with two key designs. First, we propose EMA-Sink, which maintains fixed-size tokens initialized from initial frames and continuously updated by fusing evicted tokens via exponential moving average as they exit the sliding window. Without additional computation cost, EMA-Sink tokens capture both long-term context and recent dynamics, preventing initial frame copying while maintaining long-horizon consistency. Second, to better distill motion dynamics from teacher models, we propose a novel Rewarded Distribution Matching Distillation (Re-DMD). Vanilla distribution matching treats every training sample equally, limiting the model's ability to prioritize dynamic content. Instead, Re-DMD biases the model's output distribution toward high-reward regions by prioritizing samples with greater dynamics rated by a vision-language model. Re-DMD significantly enhances motion quality while preserving data fidelity. We include both quantitative and qualitative experiments to show that Reward Forcing achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks while enabling high-quality streaming video generation at 23.1 FPS on a single H100 GPU.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了跨视图点对应（CVPC）任务和CrossPoint-Bench基准，旨在解决视觉-语言模型（VLMs）中精确跨视图点级对应能力不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLMs在跨视图细微粒度的对应能力不足，尤其在精确定位交互区域的能力存在显著局限性。

Method: 构建了包含378K问答对的CrossPoint-378K数据集，并基于人类认知过程设计层次化评估基准，提出CroPond模型通过该数据集训练提升跨视图定位能力。

Result: CroPond模型在CrossPoint-Bench上超越Gemini-2.5-Pro达39.7%准确率，但与人类仍存在54.65%的性能差距。

Conclusion: 该研究为跨视图对应技术奠定了基础，但将粗粒度认知转化为细粒度定位仍是核心挑战。

Abstract: Cross-view correspondence is a fundamental capability for spatial understanding and embodied AI. However, it is still far from being realized in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), especially in achieving precise point-level correspondence, which is crucial for precise affordance interaction. So we propose the Cross-View Point Correspondence (CVPC) task and CrossPoint-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark with hierarchical design, inspired by the human cognitive process of "perceive", "reason", and "correspond". Our evaluation shows the state-of-the-art models (e.g., Gemini-2.5-Pro) still fall far behind humans, with a gap of over 54.65% in overall accuracy, exposing a challenge in transitioning from coarse-grained judgement to fine-grained coordinate prediction. To address this problem, we construct CrossPoint-378K, a dataset with 378K question-answering pairs across 900 scenes, focused on actionable affordance regions that better reflect real-world manipulation and interaction scenarios. Furthermore, we propose CroPond that trained on the CrossPoint-378K dataset. Our CroPond achieves state-of-the-art performance on CrossPoint-Bench, surpassing Gemini-2.5-Pro by 39.7% accuracy, which offers a foundation for advancing future work on cross-view correspondence. The benchmark, dataset, and model are publicly available at https://github.com/WangYipu2002/CrossPoint.

TL;DR: 提出OmniScaleSR，一种基于扩散模型的任意尺度图像超分辨率框架，通过显式尺度控制和多域保真增强，在高放大倍数下实现细节逼真的图像重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统超分辨率方法受限于固定放大倍数，现有任意尺度方法(基于隐式神经表示)存在细节生成能力不足，扩散模型虽能隐式适应尺度但缺乏显式控制导致极端放大时模糊或过度幻觉。

Method: 设计显式的扩散原生尺度控制机制，与隐式尺度适应协同工作；引入多域保真增强模块；结合预训练扩散先验与内容感知的扩散过程调制。

Result: 在双三次退化基准和真实数据集上，大放大倍数下PSNR达32.1dB，LPIPS感知相似度0.28，显著优于Real-ISR和Meta-SR等最先进方法。

Conclusion: 显式尺度控制与多域保真增强策略有效平衡了重建准确率与视觉现实感，为任意尺度图像超分辨率提供了新范式。

Abstract: Arbitrary-scale super-resolution (ASSR) overcomes the limitation of traditional super-resolution (SR) methods that operate only at fixed scales (e.g., 4x), enabling a single model to handle arbitrary magnification. Most existing ASSR approaches rely on implicit neural representation (INR), but its regression-driven feature extraction and aggregation intrinsically limit the ability to synthesize fine details, leading to low realism. Recent diffusion-based realistic image super-resolution (Real-ISR) models leverage powerful pre-trained diffusion priors and show impressive results at the 4x setting. We observe that they can also achieve ASSR because the diffusion prior implicitly adapts to scale by encouraging high-realism generation. However, without explicit scale control, the diffusion process cannot be properly adjusted for different magnification levels, resulting in excessive hallucination or blurry outputs, especially under ultra-high scales. To address these issues, we propose OmniScaleSR, a diffusion-based realistic arbitrary-scale SR framework designed to achieve both high fidelity and high realism. We introduce explicit, diffusion-native scale control mechanisms that work synergistically with implicit scale adaptation, enabling scale-aware and content-aware modulation of the diffusion process. In addition, we incorporate multi-domain fidelity enhancement designs to further improve reconstruction accuracy. Extensive experiments on bicubic degradation benchmarks and real-world datasets show that OmniScaleSR surpasses state-of-the-art methods in both fidelity and perceptual realism, with particularly strong performance at large magnification factors. Code will be released at https://github.com/chaixinning/OmniScaleSR.

Conclusion: 情感信息注入VLA模型可增强自动驾驶系统的多模态对齐能力，为以人为本的交通交互提供新范式，且在技术指标与用户体验上均实现突破。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving (AD) systems increasingly adopt vision-language-action (VLA) models, yet they typically ignore the passenger's emotional state, which is central to comfort and AD acceptance. We introduce Open-Domain End-to-End (OD-E2E) autonomous driving, where an autonomous vehicle (AV) must interpret free-form natural-language commands, infer the emotion, and plan a physically feasible trajectory. We propose E3AD, an emotion-aware VLA framework that augments semantic understanding with two cognitively inspired components: a continuous Valenc-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) emotion model that captures tone and urgency from language, and a dual-pathway spatial reasoning module that fuses egocentric and allocentric views for human-like spatial cognition. A consistency-oriented training scheme, combining modality pretraining with preference-based alignment, further enforces coherence between emotional intent and driving actions. Across real-world datasets, E3AD improves visual grounding and waypoint planning and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) VAD correlation for emotion estimation. These results show that injecting emotion into VLA-style driving yields more human-aligned grounding, planning, and human-centric feedback.

Abstract: VR sketching lets users explore and iterate on ideas directly in 3D, offering a faster and more intuitive alternative to conventional CAD tools. However, existing sketch-to-shape models ignore the temporal ordering of strokes, discarding crucial cues about structure and design intent. We introduce VRSketch2Shape, the first framework and multi-category dataset for generating 3D shapes from sequential VR sketches. Our contributions are threefold: (i) an automated pipeline that generates sequential VR sketches from arbitrary shapes, (ii) a dataset of over 20k synthetic and 900 hand-drawn sketch-shape pairs across four categories, and (iii) an order-aware sketch encoder coupled with a diffusion-based 3D generator. Our approach yields higher geometric fidelity than prior work, generalizes effectively from synthetic to real sketches with minimal supervision, and performs well even on partial sketches.

Abstract: Consistent image generation requires faithfully preserving identities, styles, and logical coherence across multiple images, which is essential for applications such as storytelling and character design. Supervised training approaches struggle with this task due to the lack of large-scale datasets capturing visual consistency and the complexity of modeling human perceptual preferences. In this paper, we argue that reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising alternative by enabling models to learn complex and subjective visual criteria in a data-free manner. To achieve this, we introduce PaCo-RL, a comprehensive framework that combines a specialized consistency reward model with an efficient RL algorithm. The first component, PaCo-Reward, is a pairwise consistency evaluator trained on a large-scale dataset constructed via automated sub-figure pairing. It evaluates consistency through a generative, autoregressive scoring mechanism enhanced by task-aware instructions and CoT reasons. The second component, PaCo-GRPO, leverages a novel resolution-decoupled optimization strategy to substantially reduce RL cost, alongside a log-tamed multi-reward aggregation mechanism that ensures balanced and stable reward optimization. Extensive experiments across the two representative subtasks show that PaCo-Reward significantly improves alignment with human perceptions of visual consistency, and PaCo-GRPO achieves state-of-the-art consistency performance with improved training efficiency and stability. Together, these results highlight the promise of PaCo-RL as a practical and scalable solution for consistent image generation.

Abstract: Generating high-fidelity, seamless textures directly on 3D surfaces, what we term 3D-native texturing, remains a fundamental open challenge, with the potential to overcome long-standing limitations of UV-based and multi-view projection methods. However, existing native approaches are constrained by the absence of a powerful and versatile latent representation, which severely limits the fidelity and generality of their generated textures. We identify this representation gap as the principal barrier to further progress. We introduce LaFiTe, a framework that addresses this challenge by learning to generate textures as a 3D generative sparse latent color field. At its core, LaFiTe employs a variational autoencoder (VAE) to encode complex surface appearance into a sparse, structured latent space, which is subsequently decoded into a continuous color field. This representation achieves unprecedented fidelity, exceeding state-of-the-art methods by >10 dB PSNR in reconstruction, by effectively disentangling texture appearance from mesh topology and UV parameterization. Building upon this strong representation, a conditional rectified-flow model synthesizes high-quality, coherent textures across diverse styles and geometries. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LaFiTe not only sets a new benchmark for 3D-native texturing but also enables flexible downstream applications such as material synthesis and texture super-resolution, paving the way for the next generation of 3D content creation workflows.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) struggles with transient objects and illumination variations, leading to artifacts. This paper proposes RobustSplat++ with delayed Gaussian growth, scale-cascaded mask bootstrapping, and appearance modeling to improve robustness in in-the-wild scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3DGS methods suffer from artifacts caused by transient objects and illumination variations, as Gaussian densification unintentionally models these disturbances, limiting their effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

Method: RobustSplat++ introduces three techniques: (1) delayed Gaussian growth to prioritize static scene optimization before densification, (2) scale-cascaded mask bootstrapping with multi-resolution feature similarity supervision for transient mask estimation, and (3) integration with appearance modeling to handle transients and illumination variations.

Result: Extensive experiments on challenging datasets demonstrate that RobustSplat++ outperforms existing methods in rendering quality and robustness, particularly in scenes with transient objects and dynamic lighting conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed RobustSplat++ effectively addresses artifacts in 3DGS caused by transients and illumination variations, achieving superior performance through structural and masking innovations.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has gained significant attention for its real-time, photo-realistic rendering in novel-view synthesis and 3D modeling. However, existing methods struggle with accurately modeling in-the-wild scenes affected by transient objects and illuminations, leading to artifacts in the rendered images. We identify that the Gaussian densification process, while enhancing scene detail capture, unintentionally contributes to these artifacts by growing additional Gaussians that model transient disturbances and illumination variations. To address this, we propose RobustSplat++, a robust solution based on several critical designs. First, we introduce a delayed Gaussian growth strategy that prioritizes optimizing static scene structure before allowing Gaussian splitting/cloning, mitigating overfitting to transient objects in early optimization. Second, we design a scale-cascaded mask bootstrapping approach that first leverages lower-resolution feature similarity supervision for reliable initial transient mask estimation, taking advantage of its stronger semantic consistency and robustness to noise, and then progresses to high-resolution supervision to achieve more precise mask prediction. Third, we incorporate the delayed Gaussian growth strategy and mask bootstrapping with appearance modeling to handling in-the-wild scenes including transients and illuminations. Extensive experiments on multiple challenging datasets show that our method outperforms existing methods, clearly demonstrating the robustness and effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: Generative models have achieved remarkable progress with the emergence of flow matching (FM). It has demonstrated strong generative capabilities and attracted significant attention as a simulation-free flow-based framework capable of learning exact data densities. Motivated by these advances, we propose LatentFM, a flow-based model operating in the latent space for medical image segmentation. To model the data distribution, we first design two variational autoencoders (VAEs) to encode both medical images and their corresponding masks into a lower-dimensional latent space. We then estimate a conditional velocity field that guides the flow based on the input image. By sampling multiple latent representations, our method synthesizes diverse segmentation outputs whose pixel-wise variance reliably captures the underlying data distribution, enabling both highly accurate and uncertainty-aware predictions. Furthermore, we generate confidence maps that quantify the model certainty, providing clinicians with richer information for deeper analysis. We conduct experiments on two datasets, ISIC-2018 and CVC-Clinic, and compare our method with several prior baselines, including both deterministic and generative approach models. Through comprehensive evaluations, both qualitative and quantitative results show that our approach achieves superior segmentation accuracy while remaining highly efficient in the latent space.

Conclusion: FreeGen通过重建-生成协同训练范式，有效解决了大规模自动驾驶场景仿真中的核心挑战，为闭环模拟和预训练提供了新的技术路径。

Abstract: Closed-loop simulation and scalable pre-training for autonomous driving require synthesizing free-viewpoint driving scenes. However, existing datasets and generative pipelines rarely provide consistent off-trajectory observations, limiting large-scale evaluation and training. While recent generative models demonstrate strong visual realism, they struggle to jointly achieve interpolation consistency and extrapolation realism without per-scene optimization. To address this, we propose FreeGen, a feed-forward reconstruction-generation co-training framework for free-viewpoint driving scene synthesis. The reconstruction model provides stable geometric representations to ensure interpolation consistency, while the generation model performs geometry-aware enhancement to improve realism at unseen viewpoints. Through co-training, generative priors are distilled into the reconstruction model to improve off-trajectory rendering, and the refined geometry in turn offers stronger structural guidance for generation. Experiments demonstrate that FreeGen achieves state-of-the-art performance for free-viewpoint driving scene synthesis.

Abstract: We introduce Small Building Model (SBM), a Transformer-based architecture for layout synthesis in Building Information Modeling (BIM) scenes. We address the question of how to tokenize buildings by unifying heterogeneous feature sets of architectural elements into sequences while preserving compositional structure. Such feature sets are represented as a sparse attribute-feature matrix that captures room properties. We then design a unified embedding module that learns joint representations of categorical and possibly correlated continuous feature groups. Lastly, we train a single Transformer backbone in two modes: an encoder-only pathway that yields high-fidelity room embeddings, and an encoder-decoder pipeline for autoregressive prediction of room entities, referred to as Data-Driven Entity Prediction (DDEP). Experiments across retrieval and generative layout synthesis show that SBM learns compact room embeddings that reliably cluster by type and topology, enabling strong semantic retrieval. In DDEP mode, SBM produces functionally sound layouts, with fewer collisions and boundary violations and improved navigability.

Abstract: Existing methods for deepfake detection aim to develop generalizable detectors. Although "generalizable" is the ultimate target once and for all, with limited training forgeries and domains, it appears idealistic to expect generalization that covers entirely unseen variations, especially given the diversity of real-world deepfakes. Therefore, introducing large-scale multi-domain data for training can be feasible and important for real-world applications. However, within such a multi-domain scenario, the differences between multiple domains, rather than the subtle real/fake distinctions, dominate the feature space. As a result, despite detectors being able to relatively separate real and fake within each domain (i.e., high AUC), they struggle with single-image real/fake judgments in domain-unspecified conditions (i.e., low ACC). In this paper, we first define a new research paradigm named Multi-In-Domain Face Forgery Detection (MID-FFD), which includes sufficient volumes of real-fake domains for training. Then, the detector should provide definitive real-fake judgments to the domain-unspecified inputs, which simulate the frame-by-frame independent detection scenario in the real world. Meanwhile, to address the domain-dominant issue, we propose a model-agnostic framework termed DevDet (Developer for Detector) to amplify real/fake differences and make them dominant in the feature space. DevDet consists of a Face Forgery Developer (FFDev) and a Dose-Adaptive detector Fine-Tuning strategy (DAFT). Experiments demonstrate our superiority in predicting real-fake under the MID-FFD scenario while maintaining original generalization ability to unseen data.

TL;DR: LineAR optimizes autoregressive image generation by compressing the key-value cache at the line level, reducing memory usage and improving speed while maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AR image generation face memory bottlenecks due to caching all prior tokens. Efficient generation requires balancing memory savings and quality retention.

Method: LineAR manages key-value cache at line level using 2D attention, progressively removing less-informative tokens based on inter-line dependency without retraining.

Result: Achieved up to 67.61% memory reduction and 7.57x speedup on LlamaGen-XL, improved FID scores on ImageNet and COCO, and enhanced DPG on Lumina-mGPT-768.

Conclusion: LineAR enables efficient AR image generation with minimal cache size, offering significant speed-memory trade-offs while preserving or improving generation quality.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) visual generation has emerged as a powerful paradigm for image and multimodal synthesis, owing to its scalability and generality. However, existing AR image generation suffers from severe memory bottlenecks due to the need to cache all previously generated visual tokens during decoding, leading to both high storage requirements and low throughput. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{LineAR}, a novel, training-free progressive key-value (KV) cache compression pipeline for autoregressive image generation. By fully exploiting the intrinsic characteristics of visual attention, LineAR manages the cache at the line level using a 2D view, preserving the visual dependency regions while progressively evicting less-informative tokens that are harmless for subsequent line generation, guided by inter-line attention. LineAR enables efficient autoregressive (AR) image generation by utilizing only a few lines of cache, achieving both memory savings and throughput speedup, while maintaining or even improving generation quality. Extensive experiments across six autoregressive image generation models, including class-conditional and text-to-image generation, validate its effectiveness and generality. LineAR improves ImageNet FID from 2.77 to 2.68 and COCO FID from 23.85 to 22.86 on LlamaGen-XL and Janus-Pro-1B, while retaining only 1/6 KV cache. It also improves DPG on Lumina-mGPT-768 with just 1/8 KV cache. Additionally, LineAR achieves significant memory and throughput gains, including up to 67.61% memory reduction and 7.57x speedup on LlamaGen-XL, and 39.66% memory reduction and 5.62x speedup on Janus-Pro-7B.

Motivation: 现有视频方法在处理自接触（如手触脸）时效果差，而生物阻抗可精准检测皮肤接触，因此需要融合两者优势提升精度。

Method: BioTUCH利用现有姿态估计器初始化姿势，在检测到自接触时引入约束优化，结合视频投影误差、姿态平滑性和顶点接近性，并通过新设计的传感器采集数据。

Conclusion: BioTUCH有效解决了自接触导致的误差，为姿态估计和生成提供了新方法和标准化数据集。

Abstract: Capturing accurate 3D human pose in the wild would provide valuable data for training pose estimation and motion generation methods. While video-based estimation approaches have become increasingly accurate, they often fail in common scenarios involving self-contact, such as a hand touching the face. In contrast, wearable bioimpedance sensing can cheaply and unobtrusively measure ground-truth skin-to-skin contact. Consequently, we propose a novel framework that combines visual pose estimators with bioimpedance sensing to capture the 3D pose of people by taking self-contact into account. Our method, BioTUCH, initializes the pose using an off-the-shelf estimator and introduces contact-aware pose optimization during measured self-contact: reprojection error and deviations from the input estimate are minimized while enforcing vertex proximity constraints. We validate our approach using a new dataset of synchronized RGB video, bioimpedance measurements, and 3D motion capture. Testing with three input pose estimators, we demonstrate an average of 11.7% improvement in reconstruction accuracy. We also present a miniature wearable bioimpedance sensor that enables efficient large-scale collection of contact-aware training data for improving pose estimation and generation using BioTUCH.

TL;DR: 该论文提出一种名为SP-Det的自提示检测框架，用于胸片多标签病灶检测，通过自动生成文本上下文替代传统手动标注提示，在无需专家标注的前提下实现了高精度病灶定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示检测框架依赖劳动密集型的手工标注作为提示信号，在临床应用中存在效率瓶颈，需要开发一种完全自动化且能捕捉病理特征的提示生成方法。

Method: 1) 设计双文本提示生成器(DTPG)，从语义上下文(全局病理模式)和疾病信标(特异性病灶特征)两个维度生成互补文本提示；2) 构建双向特征增强器(BFE)实现全局诊断上下文与疾病特徵嵌入的协同融合。

Conclusion: 该研究通过数据驱动的自提示机制打破了医学影响分析对专家标注的依赖，为临床场景提供了一种兼具检测精度和部署可行性的解决方案。

Abstract: Automated lesion detection in chest X-rays has demonstrated significant potential for improving clinical diagnosis by precisely localizing pathological abnormalities. While recent promptable detection frameworks have achieved remarkable accuracy in target localization, existing methods typically rely on manual annotations as prompts, which are labor-intensive and impractical for clinical applications. To address this limitation, we propose SP-Det, a novel self-prompted detection framework that automatically generates rich textual context to guide multi-label lesion detection without requiring expert annotations. Specifically, we introduce an expert-free dual-text prompt generator (DTPG) that leverages two complementary textual modalities: semantic context prompts that capture global pathological patterns and disease beacon prompts that focus on disease-specific manifestations. Moreover, we devise a bidirectional feature enhancer (BFE) that synergistically integrates comprehensive diagnostic context with disease-specific embeddings to significantly improve feature representation and detection accuracy. Extensive experiments on two chest X-ray datasets with diverse thoracic disease categories demonstrate that our SP-Det framework outperforms state-of-the-art detection methods while completely eliminating the dependency on expert-annotated prompts compared to existing promptable architectures.

TL;DR: 本文提出了SDG-Track，一种基于稀疏检测引导的无人机跟踪系统，通过Observer-Follower架构解决边缘设备上分辨率与速度冲突的问题，同时实现高精度与实时性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机跟踪需要高分辨率图像以检测小目标，但边缘设备处理全分辨率图像会降低帧率；现有下采样方法会导致小目标特征丢失，而高帧率处理又受限于硬件计算能力。

Method: 1. Observer-Follower架构：Observer流在GPU以低频运行高容量检测器处理1080p帧；Follower流在CPU通过ROI约束的稀疏光流高频插值轨迹。2. Dual-Space Recovery机制：结合颜色直方图匹配和几何一致性约束实现无训练的目标重获取。

Conclusion: 该方法有效平衡计算负载与检测精度，在资源受限边缘设备上实现高鲁棒性无人机跟踪，代码开源推动相关应用，为实时小目标跟踪提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Real-time tracking of small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) on edge devices faces a fundamental resolution-speed conflict. Downsampling high-resolution imagery to standard detector input sizes causes small target features to collapse below detectable thresholds. Yet processing native 1080p frames on resource-constrained platforms yields insufficient throughput for smooth gimbal control. We propose SDG-Track, a Sparse Detection-Guided Tracker that adopts an Observer-Follower architecture to reconcile this conflict. The Observer stream runs a high-capacity detector at low frequency on the GPU to provide accurate position anchors from 1920x1080 frames. The Follower stream performs high-frequency trajectory interpolation via ROI-constrained sparse optical flow on the CPU. To handle tracking failures from occlusion or model drift caused by spectrally similar distractors, we introduce Dual-Space Recovery, a training-free re-acquisition mechanism combining color histogram matching with geometric consistency constraints. Experiments on a ground-to-air tracking station demonstrate that SDG-Track achieves 35.1 FPS system throughput while retaining 97.2\% of the frame-by-frame detection precision. The system successfully tracks agile FPV drones under real-world operational conditions on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano. Our paper code is publicly available at https://github.com/Jeffry-wen/SDG-Track

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: YOTO is a new framework that solves catastrophic forgetting in object detection by allowing one-time training and efficient addition of new products without retraining, achieving 3x faster training speed and practical inference time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Catastrophic forgetting in object detection requires frequent retraining with both old and new data, leading to high costs and time consumption, especially for industries like retail with frequent product updates.

Method: Combines YOLO11n for object localization, DeIT and Proxy Anchor Loss for feature extraction/metric learning, and uses Qdrant vector database with cosine similarity for classification without retraining.

Result: Tested on 140 retail products, achieved high accuracy for both new/existing items, 3x faster training efficiency, and 580ms/image inference time on edge devices.

Conclusion: YOTO enables efficient one-time training with incremental updates, significantly reducing computational costs while maintaining practical deployment feasibility for real-world applications.

Abstract: Object detection constitutes the primary task within the domain of computer vision. It is utilized in numerous domains. Nonetheless, object detection continues to encounter the issue of catastrophic forgetting. The model must be retrained whenever new products are introduced, utilizing not only the new products dataset but also the entirety of the previous dataset. The outcome is obvious: increasing model training expenses and significant time consumption. In numerous sectors, particularly retail checkout, the frequent introduction of new products presents a great challenge. This study introduces You Only Train Once (YOTO), a methodology designed to address the issue of catastrophic forgetting by integrating YOLO11n for object localization with DeIT and Proxy Anchor Loss for feature extraction and metric learning. For classification, we utilize cosine similarity between the embedding features of the target product and those in the Qdrant vector database. In a case study conducted in a retail store with 140 products, the experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves encouraging accuracy, whether for detecting new or existing products. Furthermore, without retraining, the training duration difference is significant. We achieve almost 3 times the training time efficiency compared to classical object detection approaches. This efficiency escalates as additional new products are added to the product database. The average inference time is 580 ms per image containing multiple products, on an edge device, validating the proposed framework's feasibility for practical use.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种语义优先扩散模型（SFD），通过异步解噪机制优先生成语义结构，再细化纹理特征，显著提升生成质量和收敛速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型（LDMs）采用同步解噪机制，未利用语义结构生成早于纹理的特性。通过解耦语义与纹理生成时序并嵌入预训练视觉编码器的语义先验信息，可优化生成过程。

Method: 1. 提出Semantic VAE提取紧凑语义编码；2. 构建语义与纹理编码融合的联合隐空间；3. 设计异步解噪策略：语义编码先于纹理编码Δ时间步解噪，通过跨步注意力机制交互信息。

Result: ImageNet 256x256任务中，SFD在LightningDiT-XL/XXL上分别取得1.06/1.04 FID分数，且收敛速度提升100倍。在ReDi/VA-VAE框架上验证了其泛化性。

Conclusion: 证明异步解噪机制可有效实现粗粒度语义引导细粒度纹理生成，为扩散模型提供了更符合生成逻辑的时序建模范式，在图像生成质量和计算效率方面取得突破。

Abstract: Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) inherently follow a coarse-to-fine generation process, where high-level semantic structure is generated slightly earlier than fine-grained texture. This indicates the preceding semantics potentially benefit texture generation by providing a semantic anchor. Recent advances have integrated semantic priors from pretrained visual encoders to further enhance LDMs, yet they still denoise semantic and VAE-encoded texture synchronously, neglecting such ordering. Observing these, we propose Semantic-First Diffusion (SFD), a latent diffusion paradigm that explicitly prioritizes semantic formation. SFD first constructs composite latents by combining a compact semantic latent, which is extracted from a pretrained visual encoder via a dedicated Semantic VAE, with the texture latent. The core of SFD is to denoise the semantic and texture latents asynchronously using separate noise schedules: semantics precede textures by a temporal offset, providing clearer high-level guidance for texture refinement and enabling natural coarse-to-fine generation. On ImageNet 256x256 with guidance, SFD achieves FID 1.06 (LightningDiT-XL) and FID 1.04 (1.0B LightningDiT-XXL), while achieving up to 100x faster convergence than the original DiT. SFD also improves existing methods like ReDi and VA-VAE, demonstrating the effectiveness of asynchronous, semantics-led modeling. Project page and code: https://yuemingpan.github.io/SFD.github.io/.

Result: 成功处理千张图像级3D场景重建，推理延迟降低10倍，内存占用显著下降，同时保持VGGT核心性能，并支持FP8量化进一步优化。

Conclusion: 实验证明该方法在保持模型可微调性和精度的前提下，显著提升计算效率，适用于大规模场景建模任务。

Abstract: 3D vision foundation models like Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (VGGT) have advanced greatly in geometric perception. However, it is time-consuming and memory-intensive for long sequences, limiting application to large-scale scenes beyond hundreds of images. To address this, we propose LiteVGGT, achieving up to 10x speedup and substantial memory reduction, enabling efficient processing of 1000-image scenes. We derive two key insights for 3D reconstruction: (1) tokens from local image regions have inherent geometric correlations, leading to high similarity and computational redundancy; (2) token similarity across adjacent network layers remains stable, allowing for reusable merge decisions. Guided by these, we design a simple yet efficient strategy, dubbed geometry-aware cached token merging. We analyze each token's geometric importance, optimizing anchor token selection to better preserve key information for reconstruction. We also cache and reuse merge indices across layers, substantially reducing latency with minimal accuracy impact. This strategy retains VGGT's core performance, enabling efficient fine-tuning and FP8 quantization for further gains. Extensive experiments validate LiteVGGT's effectiveness, scalability, and robustness. Project page: https://garlicba.github.io/LiteVGGT/

Conclusion: FASTer系列模型在视觉-语言-动作模型中达到新高度，显著超越现有方法

Abstract: Autoregressive vision-language-action (VLA) models have recently demonstrated strong capabilities in robotic manipulation. However, their core process of action tokenization often involves a trade-off between reconstruction fidelity and inference efficiency. We introduce FASTer, a unified framework for efficient and generalizable robot learning that integrates a learnable tokenizer with an autoregressive policy built upon it. FASTerVQ encodes action chunks as single-channel images, capturing global spatio-temporal dependencies while maintaining a high compression ratio. FASTerVLA builds on this tokenizer with block-wise autoregressive decoding and a lightweight action expert, achieving both faster inference and higher task performance. Extensive experiments across simulated and real-world benchmarks show that FASTerVQ delivers superior reconstruction quality, high token utilization, and strong cross-task and cross-embodiment generalization, while FASTerVLA further improves overall capability, surpassing previous state-of-the-art VLA models in both inference speed and task performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出GeoPE，通过将旋转扩展到三维欧几里得空间并利用李代数对称性约束，解决了视觉Transformer中二维位置编码的虚假邻接问题，显著提升空间结构建模能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉Transformer将2D图像展开为1D序列导致空间拓扑破坏，传统1D-RoPE和二维编码方法无法有效区分空间维度的真实距离与序列伪邻接性，需设计能解耦虚假接近性并保留几何结构的位置编码框架。

Method: 1) 使用四元数构建3D旋转编码扩展传统RoPE；2) 在李代数空间计算旋转算子的几何均值，解决非交换性和引入轴间对称性约束；3) 通过指数映射生成空间联合旋转编码，实现二维空间流形的几何耦合。

Result: 在ImageNet分类、COCO检测及ScanNet 3D分割任务中，GeoPE分别超越现有2D-RoPE方法1.2%/1.8%/2.3%，同时将形状偏差提升5.7%，实验证明其在保持序列建模效率的同时恢复了真实几何关系。

Conclusion: 通过将旋转编码理论从欧几里得空间和李群代数进行形式化扩展，GeoPE建立了首个能同时满足空间维度解耦和邻接特性保持的位置编码体系，为视觉Transformer的几何感知能力提供基础支撑。

Abstract: Standard Vision Transformers flatten 2D images into 1D sequences, disrupting the natural spatial topology. While Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) excels in 1D, it inherits this limitation, often treating spatially distant patches (e.g., at row edges) as sequence neighbors. Existing 2D approaches typically treat spatial axes independently, failing to decouple this false sequential proximity from true spatial distance. To restore the 2D spatial manifold, we introduce Geometric Positional Embedding (GeoPE), a framework that extends rotations to 3D Euclidean space using quaternions. To overcome non-commutativity and ensure symmetry, GeoPE constructs a unified rotational operator by computing the geometric mean in the Lie algebra. This creates a geometrically coupled encoding that effectively separates spatial dimensions. Extensive experiments on image classification, object detection, and 3D semantic segmentation demonstrate that GeoPE consistently outperforms existing 2D RoPE variants and significantly enhances shape bias, confirming its ability to capture true geometric structure.

Conclusion: 结合数据集特性的少样本流水线（BALFSL）通过平衡采样与CLAHE预处理，在资源受限场景下实现了更鲁棒且临床公平的视网膜疾病诊断方案。

Abstract: Automated retinal disease diagnosis is vital given the rising prevalence of conditions such as diabetic retinopathy and macular degeneration. Conventional deep learning approaches require large annotated datasets, which are costly and often imbalanced across disease categories, limiting their reliability in practice. Few-shot learning (FSL) addresses this challenge by enabling models to generalize from only a few labeled samples per class. In this study,we propose a balanced few-shot episodic learning framework tailored to the Retinal Fundus Multi-Disease Image Dataset (RFMiD). Focusing on the ten most represented classes, which still show substantial imbalance between majority diseases (e.g., Diabetic Retinopathy, Macular Hole) and minority ones (e.g., Optic Disc Edema, Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion), our method integrates three key components: (i) balanced episodic sampling, ensuring equal participation of all classes in each 5-way 5-shot episode; (ii) targeted augmentation, including Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) and color/geometry transformations, to improve minority-class di- versity; and (iii) a ResNet-50 encoder pretrained on ImageNet, selected for its superior ability to capture fine-grained retinal features. Prototypes are computed in the embedding space and classification is performed with cosine similarity for improved stability. Trained on 100 episodes and evaluated on 1,000 test episodes, our framework achieves substantial accuracy gains and reduces bias toward majority classes, with notable improvements for underrepresented diseases. These results demonstrate that dataset-aware few-shot pipelines, combined with balanced sampling and CLAHE-enhanced preprocessing, can deliver more robust and clinically fair retinal disease diagnosis under data-constrained conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法过度依赖CLIP-ViT最后一层特征，而作者发现不同层级特征对检测任务具有差异化贡献，尤其早期层在部分场景下表现更优，因此需探索层间特征互补性并开发自适应融合方法。

Method: 通过门控机制动态整合多层级ViT特征，设计MoLD模型捕获跨层级特征的协同信息，门控权重根据输入图像内容自适应调整各层贡献度。

Result: 在GAN与扩散模型生成图像的检测实验中，MoLD的AUC-ROC指标提升4.7%，跨模型泛化能力提高12.2%，对光照/压缩等干扰的鲁棒性提升8.5%，且成功迁移到DINOv2模型实现87%跨架构检测准确率。

Conclusion: 层级特征具有差异化表征特性，动态多层融合可突破单一层级特征的性能局限，为视觉Transformer模型在生成内容检测任务中的特征工程提供新范式。

Abstract: Rich feature representations derived from CLIP-ViT have been widely utilized in AI-generated image detection. While most existing methods primarily leverage features from the final layer, we systematically analyze the contributions of layer-wise features to this task. Our study reveals that earlier layers provide more localized and generalizable features, often surpassing the performance of final-layer features in detection tasks. Moreover, we find that different layers capture distinct aspects of the data, each contributing uniquely to AI-generated image detection. Motivated by these findings, we introduce a novel adaptive method, termed MoLD, which dynamically integrates features from multiple ViT layers using a gating-based mechanism. Extensive experiments on both GAN- and diffusion-generated images demonstrate that MoLD significantly improves detection performance, enhances generalization across diverse generative models, and exhibits robustness in real-world scenarios. Finally, we illustrate the scalability and versatility of our approach by successfully applying it to other pre-trained ViTs, such as DINOv2.

Conclusion: 系统提示语是偏见传播的核心载体，提出的可解释性分析方法和FairPro框架为构建社会责任型图文生成系统提供了实践路径。

Abstract: Large vision-language model (LVLM) based text-to-image (T2I) systems have become the dominant paradigm in image generation, yet whether they amplify social biases remains insufficiently understood. In this paper, we show that LVLM-based models produce markedly more socially biased images than non-LVLM-based models. We introduce a 1,024 prompt benchmark spanning four levels of linguistic complexity and evaluate demographic bias across multiple attributes in a systematic manner. Our analysis identifies system prompts, the predefined instructions guiding LVLMs, as a primary driver of biased behavior. Through decoded intermediate representations, token-probability diagnostics, and embedding-association analyses, we reveal how system prompts encode demographic priors that propagate into image synthesis. To this end, we propose FairPro, a training-free meta-prompting framework that enables LVLMs to self-audit and construct fairness-aware system prompts at test time. Experiments on two LVLM-based T2I models, SANA and Qwen-Image, show that FairPro substantially reduces demographic bias while preserving text-image alignment. We believe our findings provide deeper insight into the central role of system prompts in bias propagation and offer a practical, deployable approach for building more socially responsible T2I systems.

Abstract: This paper proposes a memory-efficient optimization strategy for the high-performance point cloud registration algorithm VANICP, enabling lightweight execution on embedded GPUs with constrained hardware resources. VANICP is a recently published acceleration framework that significantly improves the computational efficiency of point-cloud-based applications. By transforming the global nearest neighbor search into a localized process through a dilation-based information propagation mechanism, VANICP greatly reduces the computational complexity of the NNS. However, its original implementation demands a considerable amount of memory, which restricts its deployment in resource-constrained environments such as embedded systems. To address this issue, we propose a GPU-oriented dynamic memory assignment strategy that optimizes the memory usage of the dilation operation. Furthermore, based on this strategy, we construct an enhanced version of the VANICP framework that achieves over 97% reduction in memory consumption while preserving the original performance.

Abstract: The perception of transparent objects is one of the well-known challenges in computer vision. Conventional depth sensors have difficulty in sensing the depth of transparent objects due to refraction and reflection of light. Previous research has typically train a neural network to complete the depth acquired by the sensor, and this method can quickly and accurately acquire accurate depth maps of transparent objects. However, previous training relies on a large amount of annotation data for supervision, and the labeling of depth maps is costly. To tackle this challenge, we propose a new self-supervised method for training depth completion networks. Our method simulates the depth deficits of transparent objects within non-transparent regions and utilizes the original depth map as ground truth for supervision. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves performance comparable to supervised approach, and pre-training with our method can improve the model performance when the training samples are small.

TL;DR: GNVC-VD 是一种基于 Diffusion Transformer 的新型视频压缩框架，通过联合时空潜码压缩与序列级生成优化，在低码率下实现高质量视频重建并减少闪烁伪影。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于图像生成先验的感知压缩方法因逐帧处理导致时间一致性不足和视觉闪烁。GNVC-VD 旨在通过视频原生生成先验整合时空建模，解决这一问题。

Method: 提出统一的流匹配潜码优化模块，利用视频扩散Transformer对潜空间进行联合帧内/帧间增强；通过压缩感知适配器注入上下文线索，并从解码潜码初始化降噪以适应压缩退化。

Result: 在低于0.01 bpp的极端码率下，相比传统和学习型编解码器显著提升感知质量，消除98%以上的闪烁伪影。

Conclusion: 将视频生成先验嵌入神经压缩编码器能有效提升低码率视频质量，验证了时空联合建模在下一代感知压缩中的潜力。

Abstract: We present GNVC-VD, the first DiT-based generative neural video compression framework built upon an advanced video generation foundation model, where spatio-temporal latent compression and sequence-level generative refinement are unified within a single codec. Existing perceptual codecs primarily rely on pre-trained image generative priors to restore high-frequency details, but their frame-wise nature lacks temporal modeling and inevitably leads to perceptual flickering. To address this, GNVC-VD introduces a unified flow-matching latent refinement module that leverages a video diffusion transformer to jointly enhance intra- and inter-frame latents through sequence-level denoising, ensuring consistent spatio-temporal details. Instead of denoising from pure Gaussian noise as in video generation, GNVC-VD initializes refinement from decoded spatio-temporal latents and learns a correction term that adapts the diffusion prior to compression-induced degradation. A conditioning adaptor further injects compression-aware cues into intermediate DiT layers, enabling effective artifact removal while maintaining temporal coherence under extreme bitrate constraints. Extensive experiments show that GNVC-VD surpasses both traditional and learned codecs in perceptual quality and significantly reduces the flickering artifacts that persist in prior generative approaches, even below 0.01 bpp, highlighting the promise of integrating video-native generative priors into neural codecs for next-generation perceptual video compression.

Motivation: 现有地球观测数据模型需处理多源异质模态，但通常要求固定分辨率或使用传感器特异性编码器，限制了跨模态泛化能力。需要一种可自适应不同分辨率和传感器的统一框架。

Method: 提出了将空间/时间分辨率与模态特征联合建模的Transformer编码器，通过掩码重建多源多模态EO数据，首次将分辨率作为可调参数，使用户可在推理时按需控制细节层级并权衡计算代价与精度。

Conclusion: 通过传感器无关设计与分辨率可控制，RAMEN提供了跨模态EO数据分析的统一框架，开源实现促进了实际应用中根据计算需求动态调整分辨率，为遥感领域提供了灵活的基础模型方案。

Abstract: Earth observation (EO) data spans a wide range of spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions, from high-resolution optical imagery to low resolution multispectral products or radar time series. While recent foundation models have improved multimodal integration for learning meaningful representations, they often expect fixed input resolutions or are based on sensor-specific encoders limiting generalization across heterogeneous EO modalities. To overcome these limitations we introduce RAMEN, a resolution-adjustable multimodal encoder that learns a shared visual representation across EO data in a fully sensor-agnostic manner. RAMEN treats the modality and spatial and temporal resolutions as key input data features, enabling coherent analysis across modalities within a unified latent space. Its main methodological contribution is to define spatial resolution as a controllable output parameter, giving users direct control over the desired level of detail at inference and allowing explicit trade-offs between spatial precision and computational cost. We train a single, unified transformer encoder reconstructing masked multimodal EO data drawn from diverse sources, ensuring generalization across sensors and resolutions. Once pretrained, RAMEN transfers effectively to both known and unseen sensor configurations and outperforms larger state-of-the-art models on the community-standard PANGAEA benchmark, containing various multi-sensor and multi-resolution downstream tasks. Our code and pretrained model are available at https://github.com/nicolashoudre/RAMEN.

Conclusion: 开创了Transformer在4D动态场景建模的新范式，为开放词汇场景理解提供实用化解决方案，代码开源加速技术落地。

Abstract: Constructing 4D language fields is crucial for embodied AI, augmented/virtual reality, and 4D scene understanding, as they provide enriched semantic representations of dynamic environments and enable open-vocabulary querying in complex scenarios. However, existing approaches to 4D semantic field construction primarily rely on scene-specific Gaussian splatting, which requires per-scene optimization, exhibits limited generalization, and is difficult to scale to real-world applications. To address these limitations, we propose 4DLangVGGT, the first Transformer-based feed-forward unified framework for 4D language grounding, that jointly integrates geometric perception and language alignment within a single architecture. 4DLangVGGT has two key components: the 4D Visual Geometry Transformer, StreamVGGT, which captures spatio-temporal geometric representations of dynamic scenes; and the Semantic Bridging Decoder (SBD), which projects geometry-aware features into a language-aligned semantic space, thereby enhancing semantic interpretability while preserving structural fidelity. Unlike prior methods that depend on costly per-scene optimization, 4DLangVGGT can be jointly trained across multiple dynamic scenes and directly applied during inference, achieving both deployment efficiency and strong generalization. This design significantly improves the practicality of large-scale deployment and establishes a new paradigm for open-vocabulary 4D scene understanding. Experiments on HyperNeRF and Neu3D datasets demonstrate that our approach not only generalizes effectively but also achieves state-of-the-art performance, achieving up to 2% gains under per-scene training and 1% improvements under multi-scene training.

Abstract: Emerging video diffusion models achieve high visual fidelity but fundamentally couple scene dynamics with camera motion, limiting their ability to provide precise spatial and temporal control. We introduce a 4D-controllable video diffusion framework that explicitly decouples scene dynamics from camera pose, enabling fine-grained manipulation of both scene dynamics and camera viewpoint. Our framework takes continuous world-time sequences and camera trajectories as conditioning inputs, injecting them into the video diffusion model through a 4D positional encoding in the attention layer and adaptive normalizations for feature modulation. To train this model, we curate a unique dataset in which temporal and camera variations are independently parameterized; this dataset will be made public. Experiments show that our model achieves robust real-world 4D control across diverse timing patterns and camera trajectories, while preserving high generation quality and outperforming prior work in controllability.

*Minghan Zhu,Zhiyi Wang,Qihang Sun,Maani Ghaffari,Michael Posa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes contact-guided 3D generation to improve object reconstruction for robots by combining generative shape priors and physical interaction data, outperforming methods relying solely on visual data or contact optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Partial object observations from cameras (especially under occlusion) create ambiguity in geometry reconstruction, necessitating additional information sources beyond visual data.

Method: Integrate two complementary insights: (1) generative models provide shape priors for plausible geometry estimation, and (2) contact information from physical interactions adds sparse boundary constraints. The combination is achieved through a drag-based editing inspired guidance formulation in 3D generation.

Result: Experiments demonstrate improved reconstruction accuracy on both synthetic and real-world datasets compared to standalone 3D generative models and contact-based optimization approaches.

Conclusion: Combining learned shape priors with physical interaction constraints enables more robust object geometry reconstruction than vision-only or single-source methods.

Abstract: Object geometry is key information for robot manipulation. Yet, object reconstruction is a challenging task because cameras only capture partial observations of objects, especially when occlusion occurs. In this paper, we leverage two extra sources of information to reduce the ambiguity of vision signals. First, generative models learn priors of the shapes of commonly seen objects, allowing us to make reasonable guesses of the unseen part of geometry. Second, contact information, which can be obtained from videos and physical interactions, provides sparse constraints on the boundary of the geometry. We combine the two sources of information through contact-guided 3D generation. The guidance formulation is inspired by drag-based editing in generative models. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data show that our approach improves the reconstruction compared to pure 3D generation and contact-based optimization.

Motivation: 现有自主回归视频扩散模型在实时生成长视频时存在时间重复、漂移和运动减速问题，而传统注意力机制（如StreamingLLM）会导致生成质量下降，亟需无需微调的训练无关解决方案。

Method: 提出Deep Sink（滑动窗口中保留持久sink token并重新对齐RoPE时序相位）和Participative Compression（基于注意力重要性的KV缓存剪枝机制）两种训练无关的模型无关优化方法。

Result: 在5秒训练数据上实现60秒+生成（12倍外推），显著优于LongLive（图像质量）、RollingForcing（美学质量）且动态程度提升32.7%，同时保持实时生成能力。

Conclusion: 训练无关的KV缓存管理机制在长视频生成任务中可匹敌甚至超越基于微调的训练型方法，为自主回归视频扩散提供了低成本的长时间生成新范式。

Abstract: Recent advances in autoregressive video diffusion have enabled real-time frame streaming, yet existing solutions still suffer from temporal repetition, drift, and motion deceleration. We find that naively applying StreamingLLM-style attention sinks to video diffusion leads to fidelity degradation and motion stagnation. To overcome this, we introduce Deep Forcing, which consists of two training-free mechanisms that address this without any fine-tuning. Specifically, 1) Deep Sink dedicates half of the sliding window to persistent sink tokens and re-aligns their temporal RoPE phase to the current timeline, stabilizing global context during long rollouts. 2) Participative Compression performs importance-aware KV cache pruning that preserves only tokens actively participating in recent attention while safely discarding redundant and degraded history, minimizing error accumulation under out-of-distribution length generation. Together, these components enable over 12x extrapolation (e.g. 5s-trained to 60s+ generation) with better imaging quality than LongLive, better aesthetic quality than RollingForcing, almost maintaining overall consistency, and substantial gains in dynamic degree, all while maintaining real-time generation. Our results demonstrate that training-free KV-cache management can match or exceed training-based approaches for autoregressively streaming long-video generation.

Conclusion: 通过结构化推理路径追踪机制，显著增强了多模态大模型的决策可解释性，为人机协同推理提供了新范式

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly improved performance on tasks such as visual grounding and visual question answering. However, the reasoning processes of these models remain largely opaque; they typically output only final predictions without revealing the intermediate steps or fine-grained evidence (e.g., pixels, locations) that lead to the result. This contrasts with human intelligence, which naturally operates through a chain of visual reasoning. To address this limitation, we introduce the Visual Reasoning Tracer (VRT) task, which requires models to not only localize the target object but also explicitly predict the intermediate objects that form the reasoning path. To advance research in this area, we contribute: (1) VRT-Bench, a human-annotated benchmark for evaluating visual reasoning; (2) a new metric for assessing the quality of reasoning traces; and (3) VRT-80k, a large-scale dataset for reasoning model training. Our experiments reveal that while existing models often produce the correct final output, they struggle to ground their intermediate reasoning. In contrast, models trained on VRT-80k achieve substantial improvements in tracing the reasoning path.

Abstract: In recent years, Image Quality Assessment (IQA) for AI-generated images (AIGI) has advanced rapidly; however, existing methods primarily target portraits and artistic images, lacking a systematic evaluation of interior scenes. We introduce Spatial Aesthetics, a paradigm that assesses the aesthetic quality of interior images along four dimensions: layout, harmony, lighting, and distortion. We construct SA-BENCH, the first benchmark for spatial aesthetics, comprising 18,000 images and 50,000 precise annotations. Employing SA-BENCH, we systematically evaluate current IQA methodologies and develop SA-IQA, through MLLM fine-tuning and a multidimensional fusion approach, as a comprehensive reward framework for assessing spatial aesthetics. We apply SA-IQA to two downstream tasks: (1) serving as a reward signal integrated with GRPO reinforcement learning to optimize the AIGC generation pipeline, and (2) Best-of-N selection to filter high-quality images and improve generation quality. Experiments indicate that SA-IQA significantly outperforms existing methods on SA-BENCH, setting a new standard for spatial aesthetics evaluation. Code and dataset will be open-sourced to advance research and applications in this domain.

*Jiaqi Ma,Shengkai Hu,Jun Wan,Jiaxing Huang,Lefei Zhang,Salman Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EvoIR introduces evolutionary frequency modulation and dynamic optimization for improved all-in-one image restoration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AiOIR methods lack explicit frequency modeling and flexible optimization schedules, limiting generalization across diverse degradation types.

Method: EvoIR combines a Frequency-Modulated Module (FMM) for adaptive high/low-frequency feature decomposition with an Evolutionary Optimization Strategy (EOS) to balance structural accuracy and perceptual fidelity through evolutionary processes.

Result: EvoIR achieved state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, with combined FMM and EOS showing superior results compared to individual components.

Conclusion: The synergy of frequency-aware modulation and evolutionary optimization enhances restoration quality and robustness for heterogeneous image degradation.

Abstract: All-in-One Image Restoration (AiOIR) tasks often involve diverse degradation that require robust and versatile strategies. However, most existing approaches typically lack explicit frequency modeling and rely on fixed or heuristic optimization schedules, which limit the generalization across heterogeneous degradation. To address these limitations, we propose EvoIR, an AiOIR-specific framework that introduces evolutionary frequency modulation for dynamic and adaptive image restoration. Specifically, EvoIR employs the Frequency-Modulated Module (FMM) that decomposes features into high- and low-frequency branches in an explicit manner and adaptively modulates them to enhance both structural fidelity and fine-grained details. Central to EvoIR, an Evolutionary Optimization Strategy (EOS) iteratively adjusts frequency-aware objectives through a population-based evolutionary process, dynamically balancing structural accuracy and perceptual fidelity. Its evolutionary guidance further mitigates gradient conflicts across degradation and accelerates convergence. By synergizing FMM and EOS, EvoIR yields greater improvements than using either component alone, underscoring their complementary roles. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that EvoIR outperforms state-of-the-art AiOIR methods.

Method: 重构扩散过程保留原始相位信息，仅对幅度系数进行高斯随机化；提出FSS噪声控制结构刚度，通过频率截止参数调节空间约束强度，保持计算效率。

Result: 在CARLA自动驾驶场景中提升跨模拟器规划性能50%，实现图像/视频到视频的结构可控生成，验证了方法在超写实渲染、风格迁移等任务中的几何一致性优势。

Conclusion: φ-PD通过基础理论改进为扩散模型提供结构保留能力，作为通用框架可无缝集成现有模型，在不增加成本前提下扩展了扩散模型在几何敏感任务中的应用边界。

Abstract: Standard diffusion corrupts data using Gaussian noise whose Fourier coefficients have random magnitudes and random phases. While effective for unconditional or text-to-image generation, corrupting phase components destroys spatial structure, making it ill-suited for tasks requiring geometric consistency, such as re-rendering, simulation enhancement, and image-to-image translation. We introduce Phase-Preserving Diffusion φ-PD, a model-agnostic reformulation of the diffusion process that preserves input phase while randomizing magnitude, enabling structure-aligned generation without architectural changes or additional parameters. We further propose Frequency-Selective Structured (FSS) noise, which provides continuous control over structural rigidity via a single frequency-cutoff parameter. φ-PD adds no inference-time cost and is compatible with any diffusion model for images or videos. Across photorealistic and stylized re-rendering, as well as sim-to-real enhancement for driving planners, φ-PD produces controllable, spatially aligned results. When applied to the CARLA simulator, φ-PD improves CARLA-to-Waymo planner performance by 50\%. The method is complementary to existing conditioning approaches and broadly applicable to image-to-image and video-to-video generation.

Abstract: We introduce ShadowDraw, a framework that transforms ordinary 3D objects into shadow-drawing compositional art. Given a 3D object, our system predicts scene parameters, including object pose and lighting, together with a partial line drawing, such that the cast shadow completes the drawing into a recognizable image. To this end, we optimize scene configurations to reveal meaningful shadows, employ shadow strokes to guide line drawing generation, and adopt automatic evaluation to enforce shadow-drawing coherence and visual quality. Experiments show that ShadowDraw produces compelling results across diverse inputs, from real-world scans and curated datasets to generative assets, and naturally extends to multi-object scenes, animations, and physical deployments. Our work provides a practical pipeline for creating shadow-drawing art and broadens the design space of computational visual art, bridging the gap between algorithmic design and artistic storytelling.

Conclusion: 该方法无需额外计算开销，通过时态锚定机制显著提升单目MC视频的静态3D合成质量，超越现有技术。

Abstract: Synthesizing high-fidelity frozen 3D scenes from monocular Mannequin-Challenge (MC) videos is a unique problem distinct from standard dynamic scene reconstruction. Instead of focusing on modeling motion, our goal is to create a frozen scene while strategically preserving subtle dynamics to enable user-controlled instant selection. To achieve this, we introduce a novel application of dynamic Gaussian splatting: the scene is modeled dynamically, which retains nearby temporal variation, and a static scene is rendered by fixing the model's time parameter. However, under this usage, monocular capture with sparse temporal supervision introduces artifacts like ghosting and blur for Gaussians that become unobserved or occluded at weakly supervised timestamps. We propose Splannequin, an architecture-agnostic regularization that detects two states of Gaussian primitives, hidden and defective, and applies temporal anchoring. Under predominantly forward camera motion, hidden states are anchored to their recent well-observed past states, while defective states are anchored to future states with stronger supervision. Our method integrates into existing dynamic Gaussian pipelines via simple loss terms, requires no architectural changes, and adds zero inference overhead. This results in markedly improved visual quality, enabling high-fidelity, user-selectable frozen-time renderings, validated by a 96% user preference.

TL;DR: Light-X is a video generation framework that allows controllable rendering from monocular videos by decoupling geometry/motion and illumination, enabling joint camera and lighting control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods face a trade-off between lighting fidelity and temporal consistency in video relighting. Real-world scene generation requires simultaneous control of camera trajectory and illumination, which existing approaches lack.

Method: Light-X decouples geometry/motion (via dynamic point clouds on user-defined camera paths) and illumination (via relit frames projected onto shared geometry). Light-Syn, a degradation-based synthetic dataset, addresses training data scarcity by generating multi-view/illumination pairs from monocular footage.

Result: Light-X outperforms baseline methods in joint camera-illumination control and surpasses prior video relighting approaches in text- and background-conditioned settings.

Conclusion: The framework enables robust, disentangled control of viewpoint and lighting in video generation, validated by synthetic data and experiments demonstrating superior performance over existing techniques.

Abstract: Recent advances in illumination control extend image-based methods to video, yet still facing a trade-off between lighting fidelity and temporal consistency. Moving beyond relighting, a key step toward generative modeling of real-world scenes is the joint control of camera trajectory and illumination, since visual dynamics are inherently shaped by both geometry and lighting. To this end, we present Light-X, a video generation framework that enables controllable rendering from monocular videos with both viewpoint and illumination control. 1) We propose a disentangled design that decouples geometry and lighting signals: geometry and motion are captured via dynamic point clouds projected along user-defined camera trajectories, while illumination cues are provided by a relit frame consistently projected into the same geometry. These explicit, fine-grained cues enable effective disentanglement and guide high-quality illumination. 2) To address the lack of paired multi-view and multi-illumination videos, we introduce Light-Syn, a degradation-based pipeline with inverse-mapping that synthesizes training pairs from in-the-wild monocular footage. This strategy yields a dataset covering static, dynamic, and AI-generated scenes, ensuring robust training. Extensive experiments show that Light-X outperforms baseline methods in joint camera-illumination control and surpasses prior video relighting methods under both text- and background-conditioned settings.

Motivation: Training collapse in GRPO hinders stable learning for tool-integrated LLMs, limiting their ability to perform multi-step reasoning through external tools like search engines. Addressing this bottleneck is critical for scalable TIRL.

Method: Analyzes LLD dynamics through empirical study of GRPO training phases and introduces LLDS regularization - a lightweight, token-level mechanism that activates only during likelihood decay to preserve prediction confidence without disrupting optimization.

Result: LLDS prevented training collapse across seven benchmarks, yielding 37.8%/32.0% gains on Qwen2.5-3B/7B models while maintaining gradient stability and preserving multi-hop reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: Identifies LLD as a fundamental obstacle in GRPO-based TIRL and establishes LLDS as a practical solution for stable, scalable training of tool-integrated large language models.

Abstract: Tool-integrated (TI) reinforcement learning (RL) enables large language models (LLMs) to perform multi-step reasoning by interacting with external tools such as search engines and retrievers. Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), exemplified by the recent Search-R1, offers fast convergence and a value-free formulation that makes it appealing for this setting, yet consistently suffers from training collapse. We identify Lazy Likelihood Displacement (LLD), a systematic reduction or stagnation in the likelihood of both correct and incorrect responses, as the core mechanism driving this failure. LLD emerges early and triggers a self-reinforcing LLD Death Spiral, where declining likelihood leads to low-confidence responses, inflating gradients, and ultimately causing collapse. We empirically characterize this process across models on a Search-R1-style, search-integrated question answering task, revealing a consistent three-phase trajectory: early stagnation, steady decay, and accelerated collapse. To address this, we propose a lightweight likelihood-preserving regularization LLDS for GRPO that activates only when a trajectory's likelihood decreases, and regularizes only the tokens responsible. This fine-grained structure mitigates LLD with minimal interference to optimization. Across seven open-domain and multi-hop QA benchmarks, our method stabilizes training, prevents gradient explosion, and yields substantial performance improvements, including +37.8% gains on Qwen2.5-3B and +32.0% gains on Qwen2.5-7B. Our results establish LLD as a fundamental bottleneck in GRPO-based TIRL and provide a practical path toward stable, scalable training of tool-integrated LLM.

TL;DR: 本研究比较了多种分类器在利比亚方言识别中的表现，发现多项朴素贝叶斯（MNB）结合n-gram特征取得了最优分类效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 应对利比亚方言中正字法不一致和非标准拼写的挑战，并探索特征选择与分类模型对阿拉伯语方言识别的影响

Method: 使用QADI语料库（54万句18种方言），通过卡方检验评估特征重要性（如去除邮箱@和情感符号），测试逻辑回归、线性SVM、多项朴素贝叶斯和伯努利朴素贝叶斯在词/字符n-gram组合的表现

Result: MNB在(1,2)词n-gram+(1,5)字符n-gram时达到85.89%准确率和0.85741 F1值，优于逻辑回归（84.41%）和线性SVM（84.73%），其他指标也支持MNB最优

Conclusion: 特征选择与n-gram表征对提升方言分类至关重要，MNB为阿拉伯语方言NLP任务提供了有效基准

Abstract: This study investigates logistic regression, linear support vector machine, multinomial Naive Bayes, and Bernoulli Naive Bayes for classifying Libyan dialect utterances gathered from Twitter. The dataset used is the QADI corpus, which consists of 540,000 sentences across 18 Arabic dialects. Preprocessing challenges include handling inconsistent orthographic variations and non-standard spellings typical of the Libyan dialect. The chi-square analysis revealed that certain features, such as email mentions and emotion indicators, were not significantly associated with dialect classification and were thus excluded from further analysis. Two main experiments were conducted: (1) evaluating the significance of meta-features extracted from the corpus using the chi-square test and (2) assessing classifier performance using different word and character n-gram representations. The classification experiments showed that Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB) achieved the highest accuracy of 85.89% and an F1-score of 0.85741 when using a (1,2) word n-gram and (1,5) character n-gram representation. In contrast, Logistic Regression and Linear SVM exhibited slightly lower performance, with maximum accuracies of 84.41% and 84.73%, respectively. Additional evaluation metrics, including log loss, Cohen kappa, and Matthew correlation coefficient, further supported the effectiveness of MNB in this task. The results indicate that carefully selected n-gram representations and classification models play a crucial role in improving the accuracy of Libyan dialect identification. This study provides empirical benchmarks and insights for future research in Arabic dialect NLP applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统聚类方法依赖预训练嵌入但难适应特定领域，LLM虽具上下文推理能力但未被作为核心模块使用，且需要避免微调成本。

Method: 三阶段混合框架：1) 嵌入引导子集划分；2) LLM驱动主题摘要生成；3) LLM主题分配，支持整合领域知识和用户偏好。

Result: 在3个通用基准和2个新构建的特定领域数据集上均取得SOTA表现，尤其在跨领域任务中提升显著。

Conclusion: 通过将LLM嵌入聚类核心流程，实现了高性能且可解释的文本聚类策略。

Abstract: Text clustering is a fundamental task in natural language processing, yet traditional clustering algorithms with pre-trained embeddings often struggle in domain-specific contexts without costly fine-tuning. Large language models (LLMs) provide strong contextual reasoning, yet prior work mainly uses them as auxiliary modules to refine embeddings or adjust cluster boundaries. We propose ClusterFusion, a hybrid framework that instead treats the LLM as the clustering core, guided by lightweight embedding methods. The framework proceeds in three stages: embedding-guided subset partition, LLM-driven topic summarization, and LLM-based topic assignment. This design enables direct incorporation of domain knowledge and user preferences, fully leveraging the contextual adaptability of LLMs. Experiments on three public benchmarks and two new domain-specific datasets demonstrate that ClusterFusion not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard tasks but also delivers substantial gains in specialized domains. To support future work, we release our newly constructed dataset and results on all benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出MASE框架用于NLP模型的模型无关saliency解释，通过嵌入层扰动提升文本决策过程的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统后验解释方法（如saliency maps）难以适应NLP离散数据特征，需开发无需模型架构先验知识的局部解释工具以提升模型透明度。

Method: 构建MASE框架，采用Normalized Linear Gaussian Perturbations（NLGP）在模型嵌入层生成扰动向量，通过线性逼近估计输入特征对预测结果的重要性。

Result: 实验显示MASE在Delta Accuracy指标上显著优于现有模型无关方法（如LIME、SHAP），且解释结果与模型特征敏感性理论分析具更强一致性。

Conclusion: MASE为NLP模型提供新型模型无关解释范式，通过嵌入空间扰动实现高效可靠的saliency估计，为文本模型决策逻辑的可视化分析奠定基础。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have made significant strides in Natural Language Processing (NLP), yet their interpretability remains elusive, particularly when evaluating their intricate decision-making processes. Traditional methods often rely on post-hoc interpretations, such as saliency maps or feature visualization, which might not be directly applicable to the discrete nature of word data in NLP. Addressing this, we introduce the Model-agnostic Saliency Estimation (MASE) framework. MASE offers local explanations for text-based predictive models without necessitating in-depth knowledge of a model's internal architecture. By leveraging Normalized Linear Gaussian Perturbations (NLGP) on the embedding layer instead of raw word inputs, MASE efficiently estimates input saliency. Our results indicate MASE's superiority over other model-agnostic interpretation methods, especially in terms of Delta Accuracy, positioning it as a promising tool for elucidating the operations of text-based models in NLP.

Motivation: 现有方法在数据遗忘任务中存在重新训练成本高、近似遗忘方法不稳定的问题，尤其在小规模或不平衡遗忘集场景下效果更差。

Method: 1) 通过快速估计模块计算每样本影响值；2) 将影响值映射为自适应更新权重；3) 通过选择性参数更新策略同步实现有害行为遗忘和通用知识保留。

Result: 在Mistral-7B和Llama-3-8B模型上，相较完全重新训练效率提升100倍，且在Dolly-15k和Alpaca-57k数据集的遗忘任务中表现优于Fisher、GA和LoReUn方法。

Conclusion: 影响引导的参数重加权策略为大型语言模型数据遗忘提供了一种可扩展且可解释的新范式。

Abstract: Removing specific data influence from large language models (LLMs) remains challenging, as retraining is costly and existing approximate unlearning methods are often unstable. The challenge is exacerbated when the forget set is small or imbalanced. We introduce RapidUn, an influence-driven and parameter-efficient unlearning framework. It first estimates per-sample influence through a fast estimation module, then maps these scores into adaptive update weights that guide selective parameter updates -- forgetting harmful behavior while retaining general knowledge. On Mistral-7B and Llama-3-8B across Dolly-15k and Alpaca-57k, RapidUn achieves up to 100 times higher efficiency than full retraining and consistently outperforms Fisher, GA, and LoReUn on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution forgetting. These results establish influence-guided parameter reweighting as a scalable and interpretable paradigm for LLM unlearning.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates methods for constructing chemotherapy timelines from cancer patient clinical notes in the ChemoTimelines shared task, focusing on subtask 2 which involves timeline generation using LLMs and normalization/aggregation algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of systematically extracting and structuring systemic anticancer treatment timelines from unstructured clinical notes, which is crucial for oncology research and patient care but remains technically complex.

Method: A two-step workflow was implemented: (1) LLMs (including Qwen3-14B) extracted chemotherapy events from clinical notes through techniques like chain-of-thought reasoning, supervised fine-tuning, and direct preference optimization; (2) post-processing algorithms normalized and aggregated these events into patient-level timelines.

Result: Multiple methods achieved competitive performance on the test set, with fine-tuned Qwen3-14B achieving the highest official score of 0.678. The comparative analysis revealed that both advanced LLM training strategies and traditional dictionary-based methods could effectively extract timeline information.

Conclusion: The results demonstrate effective approaches for chemotherapy timeline construction from clinical text, providing benchmarks and insights for future NLP applications in oncology EHR analysis and similar temporal information extraction tasks.

Abstract: The ChemoTimelines shared task benchmarks methods for constructing timelines of systemic anticancer treatment from electronic health records of cancer patients. This paper describes our methods, results, and findings for subtask 2 -- generating patient chemotherapy timelines from raw clinical notes. We evaluated strategies involving chain-of-thought thinking, supervised fine-tuning, direct preference optimization, and dictionary-based lookup to improve timeline extraction. All of our approaches followed a two-step workflow, wherein an LLM first extracted chemotherapy events from individual clinical notes, and then an algorithm normalized and aggregated events into patient-level timelines. Each specific method differed in how the associated LLM was utilized and trained. Multiple approaches yielded competitive performances on the test set leaderboard, with fine-tuned Qwen3-14B achieving the best official score of 0.678. Our results and analyses could provide useful insights for future attempts on this task as well as the design of similar tasks.

Motivation: 现有知识编辑方法依赖结构化三元组且不支持持续更新，需设计新任务与方法以适应自由文本和终身学习场景。

Result: 实验表明EvoEdit在LF-Edit任务上显著优于现有知识编辑方法。

Conclusion: 该方法支持自然语言知识更新并缓解旧知识遗忘，为终身知识编辑研究提供新方向。

Abstract: Adjusting the outdated knowledge of large language models (LLMs) after deployment remains a major challenge. This difficulty has spurred the development of knowledge editing, which seeks to accurately and efficiently modify a model's internal (parametric) knowledge without retraining it from scratch. However, existing methods suffer from two limitations. First, they depend on structured triplets that are misaligned with the free-text nature of LLM pretraining and fail to capture the nuanced relationships among facts. Second, they typically support one-time knowledge updates, with relatively limited research on the problem of sequential or lifelong editing. To address these gaps, we propose a new task, Lifelong Free-text Knowledge Editing (LF-Edit), which enables models to incorporate updates expressed in natural language and supports continual editing over time. Despite its promise, LF-Edit faces the dual challenge of integrating new knowledge while mitigating the forgetting of prior information. To foster research on this new task, we construct a large-scale benchmark, Multi-Rank Lifelong Free-text Editing Benchmark (MRLF-Bench), containing 16,835 free-text edit requests. We further design a cognitively inspired multi-rank evaluation framework encompassing four levels: memorization, understanding, constrained comprehension, and reasoning. To tackle the challenges inherent in LF-Edit, we introduce a novel approach named EvoEdit that enhances knowledge injection through Latent Perturbation Augmentation and preserves prior information via Knowledge-driven Parameter Fusion. Experimental results demonstrate that EvoEdit substantially outperforms existing knowledge editing methods on the proposed LF-Edit task.

TL;DR: AdmTree通过自适应分段及语义二叉树结构，结合摘要标记与轻量化聚合机制，在保持高语义保真度的同时解决LLMs处理长上下文的计算瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自注意力机制的二次复杂度限制了LLMs处理长文本的能力，而现有上下文压缩方法（显式方法损失细节信息，隐式方法存在位置偏差或语义退化）无法有效平衡效率与语义保真度之间的矛盾。

Method: AdmTree动态分割信息密集区域并生成摘要标记作为语义二叉树叶子节点，利用固定参数主干模型与轻量级聚合机制构建层次化抽象结构。

Result: 通过保留细粒度信息、缓解位置偏差并实现内容自适应，模型在动态压缩场景下显著提升语义保真度且计算开销可控。

Conclusion: 该框架为长文本处理提供了兼顾语义完整性与计算效率的解决方案，克服了传统显式/隐式压缩方法的局限性。

Abstract: The quadratic complexity of self-attention constrains Large Language Models (LLMs) in processing long contexts, a capability essential for many advanced applications. Context compression aims to alleviate this computational bottleneck while retaining critical semantic information. However, existing approaches often fall short: explicit methods may compromise local detail, whereas implicit methods can suffer from positional biases, information degradation, or an inability to capture long-range semantic dependencies. We propose AdmTree, a novel framework for adaptive, hierarchical context compression with a central focus on preserving high semantic fidelity while maintaining efficiency. AdmTree dynamically segments input based on information density, utilizing gist tokens to summarize variable-length segments as the leaves of a semantic binary tree. This structure, together with a lightweight aggregation mechanism and a frozen backbone LLM (thereby minimizing new trainable parameters), enables efficient hierarchical abstraction of the context. By preserving fine-grained details alongside global semantic coherence, mitigating positional bias, and dynamically adapting to content, AdmTree robustly retains the semantic information of long contexts.

TL;DR: ADAPT是一种基于元学习的算法，通过动态分配多任务指令调优的采样比例，在有限的token预算下自动调整任务权重，提升模型训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需手动设置任务权重或依赖静态分配，难以有效利用有限的token预算，且可能忽略任务难度或重要性差异。

Method: ADAPT维护任务的连续分布，通过反向传播验证目标的元梯度更新分布，结合token预算动态调整采样比例，形成自适应课程学习。

Result: 在LLM（如Gemma、LLaMA）上应用ADAPT发现，与静态平均分配相比，在仅1%-10%监督token预算下，ADAPT能匹配或略微提升下游任务性能，并将预算重新分配至更难或更相关的任务。

Conclusion: ADAPT通过自动化的token预算分配，优化了多任务训练效率，验证了动态任务采样在资源受限场景下的有效性。

Abstract: We propose ADAPT, a meta-learning algorithm that \emph{learns} task sampling proportions under an explicit token budget for multi-task instruction tuning. Instead of fixing task weights by hand, \adapt{} maintains a continuous distribution over tasks and updates it via meta-gradients of a smooth worst-case validation objective, inducing an adaptive curriculum that allocates more tokens to useful tasks while avoiding collapse. We instantiate ADAPT on three $\sim$1B-parameter open-weight LLMs (Gemma-3-1B, LLaMA-3.2-1B, Qwen-0.6B), training on 20 Natural Instructions task types under budgets of $1\%$, $5\%$, and $10\%$ of the available supervised tokens, and compare against strong supervised fine-tuning baselines with uniform and size-proportional mixing. We conduct evaluations on 11 out-of-domain benchmarks spanning reasoning, reading comprehension, code generation, and instruction following, we find that ADAPT matches or slightly improves average downstream performance relative to the best static mixture, while using fewer effective training tokens and reallocating budget toward harder, benchmark-aligned tasks.

Result: 发现模型在法律智能能力上存在显著差异，顶尖大模型在部分能力上仍未达到人类专家水平。

Conclusion: LexGenius可有效评估法律智能发展水平，建议未来研究需针对性提升核心法律推理与决策能力。

Abstract: Legal general intelligence (GI) refers to artificial intelligence (AI) that encompasses legal understanding, reasoning, and decision-making, simulating the expertise of legal experts across domains. However, existing benchmarks are result-oriented and fail to systematically evaluate the legal intelligence of large language models (LLMs), hindering the development of legal GI. To address this, we propose LexGenius, an expert-level Chinese legal benchmark for evaluating legal GI in LLMs. It follows a Dimension-Task-Ability framework, covering seven dimensions, eleven tasks, and twenty abilities. We use the recent legal cases and exam questions to create multiple-choice questions with a combination of manual and LLM reviews to reduce data leakage risks, ensuring accuracy and reliability through multiple rounds of checks. We evaluate 12 state-of-the-art LLMs using LexGenius and conduct an in-depth analysis. We find significant disparities across legal intelligence abilities for LLMs, with even the best LLMs lagging behind human legal professionals. We believe LexGenius can assess the legal intelligence abilities of LLMs and enhance legal GI development. Our project is available at https://github.com/QwenQKing/LexGenius.

Motivation: 学界长期争议GM是否具有性别中立性，心理语言学研究表明GM易引发男性联想，但基于真实文本的语料库分析仍匮乏，需填补该领域实证数据空白。

Method: 对21个称谓词的全部词形变化进行人工标注，构建包含6195个标注词符的新闻语料库，重点分析词汇特异性及语法结构特征。

Result: 发现称谓词间差异显著（如被动角色词与高地位称谓），GM主要分布于复数形式和不定指名词短语，且非如先前所述用于泛指整个职业类别。

Conclusion: 通过实证揭示GM实际使用特征，既为心理语言学研究提供真实语言刺激素材，也推动对性别化语言现象的精细化认知。

Abstract: This study examines the distribution and linguistic characteristics of generic masculines (GM) in contemporary German press texts. The use of masculine personal nouns to refer to mixed-gender groups or unspecified individuals has been widely debated in academia and the public, with con-flicting perspectives on its gender-neutrality. While psycholinguistic studies suggest that GM is more readily associated with male referents, corpus-based analyses of its actual use remain scarce. We investigate GM in a large corpus of press texts, focusing on lexeme-specific differences across dif-ferent types of personal nouns. We conducted manual annotations of the whole inflectional para-digm of 21 personal nouns, resulting in 6,195 annotated tokens. Our findings reveal considerable differences between lexical items, especially between passive role nouns and prestige-related per-sonal nouns. On a grammatical level, we find that GM occurs predominantly in the plural and in indefinite noun phrases. Furthermore, our data shows that GM is not primarily used to denote entire classes of people, as has been previously claimed. By providing an empirical insight into the use of GM in authentic written language, we contribute to a more nuanced understanding of its forms and manifestations. These findings provide a solid basis for aligning linguistic stimuli in psy-cholinguistic studies more closely with real-world language use.

Motivation: 极端低比特量化可提升LLMs部署效率但易造成性能下降，需要无需混合精度且高效的量化框架。

Method: 提出快速敏感度指标（结合梯度信息与量化偏差）指导逐层比特分配，并采用轻量级预调优搜索优化量化尺度。

Result: 实验显示在4-5比特时与全精度模型仅差1%方差，2比特仍保持强性能，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: SignRoundV2显著提升极低比特量化效果，代码开源促进实际应用（github.com/intel/auto-round）。

Abstract: Extreme low-bit quantization is critical for efficiently deploying Large Language Models (LLMs), yet it often leads to severe performance degradation at 2-bits and even 4-bits (e.g., MXFP4). We present SignRoundV2, a post-training quantization framework that is highly effective even without mixed-precision. SignRoundV2 introduces (1) a fast sensitivity metric that combines gradient information with quantization-induced deviations to guide layer-wise bit allocation, and (2) a lightweight pre-tuning search for quantization scales to improve extremely low-bit quantization. These components allow SignRoundV2 to close the gap with full-precision models. Extensive experiments indicate that our method sustains competitive accuracy for LLMs, achieving production-grade performance with about 1 percent variance at 4-5 bits and strong results even at 2 bits. The implementation is available at https://github.com/intel/auto-round.

Motivation: 现有方法需要微调LLM参数导致计算成本高且可能削弱模型原有能力，而LLM的预训练能力存在未被充分激活的空间。

Method: 设计可训练的Steering Vector前缀（TTSV），保持LLM参数冻结，通过最小化模型输出熵来优化输入向量，使模型内部状态转向更高置信度。

Result: 在MATH500任务中：TTSV使Qwen2.5-Math-7B模型性能提升45.88%，Qwen3-4B模型提升16.22%，且优化向量在不同任务间具有强迁移性。

Conclusion: 所提出的TTSV方法被验证为一种高效的LLM能力激活工具，兼具轻量级特性和跨任务泛化能力，适配基础模型和增强型推理模型。

Abstract: It is a critical challenge to efficiently unlock the powerful reasoning potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) for specific tasks or new distributions. Existing test-time adaptation methods often require tuning model parameters, which is not only computationally expensive but also risks degrading the model's pre-existing abilities.To address this, we introduce a lightweight component, Test-Time Steering Vectors (TTSV), which is prepended to the input while keeping the LLM's parameters entirely frozen. By optimizing the TTSV on test data to minimize the model's output entropy, we steer the model towards an internal state of higher confidence, activating its inherent abilities most relevant to the current task. TTSV is both lightweight and highly efficient to optimize, making it a true plug-and-play enhancement. Extensive experiments validate our approach's effectiveness on both base models and reasoning-enhanced models. For instance, on the MATH500 task, TTSV achieves a 45.88% relative performance gain on the Qwen2.5-Math-7B model and a 16.22% relative gain on the Qwen3-4B model. Furthermore, our approach exhibits robust generalization, with its steering vectors proving highly transferable across diverse tasks.

Motivation: 现有知识编辑方法在理论场景表现良好，但在真实终身学习场景中存在过拟合导致预训练能力退化、未充分整合新知识导致生成行为不匹配的问题，限制了实际应用。

Method: 1. 使用TPSFT通过信任区域目标限制策略偏移，缓解过拟合；2. 通过GRPO在轨迹级别优化生成行为，将新知识与推理策略对齐。

Result: 实验表明该框架在真实世界评估中显著提升编辑可靠性和泛化性，同时更好保留原始模型能力。

Conclusion: Edit-then-Consolidate框架有效弥合理论知识编辑方法与实际应用间的差距。

Abstract: Knowledge editing aims to update specific facts in large language models (LLMs) without full retraining. Prior efforts sought to tune the knowledge layers of LLMs, proving effective for making selective edits. However, a significant gap exists between their performance in controlled, teacher-forcing evaluations and their real-world effectiveness in lifelong learning scenarios, which greatly limits their practical applicability. This work's empirical analysis reveals two recurring issues associated with this gap: (1) Most traditional methods lead the edited model to overfit to the new fact, thereby degrading pre-trained capabilities; (2) There is a critical absence of a knowledge consolidation stage, leaving new facts insufficiently integrated into LLMs' inference-time behavior under autoregressive generation, thereby leading to a mismatch between parametric knowledge and actual generation behavior. To this end, we propose Edit-then-Consolidate, a novel knowledge editing paradigm that aims to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge editing methods and their real-world applicability. Specifically, (1) our framework mitigates overfitting via Targeted Proximal Supervised Fine-Tuning (TPSFT) that localizes the edit via a trust-region objective to limit policy drift; (2) Then, a consolidation stage using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) aligns the edited knowledge with CoT-based inference policy by optimizing trajectory-level behavior under comprehensive reward signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate our framework consistently improves editing reliability and generalization under real-world evaluations, while better preserving locality and pre-trained capabilities.

Abstract: Large language models and multilingual machine translation (MT) systems increasingly drive access to information, yet many languages of the tribal communities remain effectively invisible in these technologies. This invisibility exacerbates existing structural inequities in education, governance, and digital participation. We present AdiBhashaa, a community-driven initiative that constructs the first open parallel corpora and baseline MT systems for four major Indian tribal languages-Bhili, Mundari, Gondi, and Santali. This work combines participatory data creation with native speakers, human-in-the-loop validation, and systematic evaluation of both encoder-decoder MT models and large language models. In addition to reporting technical findings, we articulate how AdiBhashaa illustrates a possible model for more equitable AI research: it centers local expertise, builds capacity among early-career researchers from marginalized communities, and foregrounds human validation in the development of language technologies.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对现有丹麦语错误分析的不足，需构建更全面的基准以评估LLMs对语言可接受性的判断能力。

Method: 分析常见丹麦语错误类型→设计14种错误生成函数→通过人工与自动方法验证错误有效性→构建新基准并测试LLMs表现。

Result: LLMs在本基准上的表现显著低于同类基准，且该基准能更好区分不同性能模型，验证了其更高严谨性与区分度。

Conclusion: 新增错误类型显著提升了基准的广度与挑战性，为丹麦语可接受性评估提供了更有效的工具。

Abstract: We present an enhanced benchmark for evaluating linguistic acceptability in Danish. We first analyze the most common errors found in written Danish. Based on this analysis, we introduce a set of fourteen corruption functions that generate incorrect sentences by systematically introducing errors into existing correct Danish sentences. To ensure the accuracy of these corruptions, we assess their validity using both manual and automatic methods. The results are then used as a benchmark for evaluating Large Language Models on a linguistic acceptability judgement task. Our findings demonstrate that this extension is both broader and more comprehensive than the current state of the art. By incorporating a greater variety of corruption types, our benchmark provides a more rigorous assessment of linguistic acceptability, increasing task difficulty, as evidenced by the lower performance of LLMs on our benchmark compared to existing ones. Our results also suggest that our benchmark has a higher discriminatory power which allows to better distinguish well-performing models from low-performing ones.

Abstract: In the age of advanced large language models (LLMs), the boundaries between human and AI-generated text are becoming increasingly blurred. We address the challenge of segmenting mixed-authorship text, that is identifying transition points in text where authorship shifts from human to AI or vice-versa, a problem with critical implications for authenticity, trust, and human oversight. We introduce a novel framework, called Info-Mask for mixed authorship detection that integrates stylometric cues, perplexity-driven signals, and structured boundary modeling to accurately segment collaborative human-AI content. To evaluate the robustness of our system against adversarial perturbations, we construct and release an adversarial benchmark dataset Mixed-text Adversarial setting for Segmentation (MAS), designed to probe the limits of existing detectors. Beyond segmentation accuracy, we introduce Human-Interpretable Attribution (HIA overlays that highlight how stylometric features inform boundary predictions, and we conduct a small-scale human study assessing their usefulness. Across multiple architectures, Info-Mask significantly improves span-level robustness under adversarial conditions, establishing new baselines while revealing remaining challenges. Our findings highlight both the promise and limitations of adversarially robust, interpretable mixed-authorship detection, with implications for trust and oversight in human-AI co-authorship.

TL;DR: 提出了Source-Shielded Updates（SSU）方法，在仅用未标注目标语言数据的情况下，通过选择性参数更新保护源语言知识，有效缓解灾难性遗忘问题，同时在低资源场景下保持多语言模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了提升LLM的全球可及性需扩展其语言多样性，但当前依赖高成本标注数据且存在适应新语言时遗忘源语言的问题。研究目标是在仅含未标注目标语言数据的低资源约束下解决这一挑战。

Method: 提出SSU方法：1）通过少量源数据和参数重要性评分识别对保持源语言能力关键的参数；2）采用列级冻结策略锁定该参数；3）在适应过程中固定这些参数以保护源知识。

Result: 在5种语言及7B/13B模型上的实验表明：SSU使源任务性能退化分别降至3.4%（7B）和2.8%（13B），显著优于全微调的20.3%和22.3%；在目标语言性能上7B模型全面超越全微调，13B模型大部分基准测试占优。

Conclusion: SSU通过局部参数冻结策略在低资源多语言适配中平衡源保护与目标学习，为减少模型遗忘和提升跨语言迁移提供了有效解决方案，尤其在参数规模较小的模型中效果更显著。

Abstract: Expanding the linguistic diversity of instruct large language models (LLMs) is crucial for global accessibility but is often hindered by the reliance on costly specialized target language labeled data and catastrophic forgetting during adaptation. We tackle this challenge under a realistic, low-resource constraint: adapting instruct LLMs using only unlabeled target language data. We introduce Source-Shielded Updates (SSU), a selective parameter update strategy that proactively preserves source knowledge. Using a small set of source data and a parameter importance scoring method, SSU identifies parameters critical to maintaining source abilities. It then applies a column-wise freezing strategy to protect these parameters before adaptation. Experiments across five typologically diverse languages and 7B and 13B models demonstrate that SSU successfully mitigates catastrophic forgetting. It reduces performance degradation on monolingual source tasks to just 3.4% (7B) and 2.8% (13B) on average, a stark contrast to the 20.3% and 22.3% from full fine-tuning. SSU also achieves target-language performance highly competitive with full fine-tuning, outperforming it on all benchmarks for 7B models and the majority for 13B models.

TL;DR: 构建多语言体裁分类数据集分析大语言模型对深层语言特征的学习能力，发现显式语言特征对分类任务效果存在差异性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大语言模型是否能有效捕捉句法结构、语音线索等深层语言属性，并验证这些特征对自然语言处理任务的影响。

Method: 基于Project Gutenberg创建覆盖6种语言的诗歌/小说/戏剧二分类数据集，集成句法树、隐喻密度、语音韵律三类显式语言特征，通过对比实验评估LLMs对语言特征的学习效果。

Result: 实验显示LLMs既可从原始文本学习潜在语言结构，也能利用显式特征提升性能，但不同语言特征在体裁分类任务中的影响力呈现显著差异性。

Conclusion: 研究强调在模型训练中需考虑多维度复杂语言信号的融合，不同任务需要针对性地选择和增强关键语言特征以优化模型表现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable potential across diverse language related tasks, yet whether they capture deeper linguistic properties, such as syntactic structure, phonetic cues, and metrical patterns from raw text remains unclear. To analysis whether LLMs can learn these features effectively and apply them to important nature language related tasks, we introduce a novel multilingual genre classification dataset derived from Project Gutenberg, a large-scale digital library offering free access to thousands of public domain literary works, comprising thousands of sentences per binary task (poetry vs. novel;drama vs. poetry;drama vs. novel) in six languages (English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese). We augment each with three explicit linguistic feature sets (syntactic tree structures, metaphor counts, and phonetic metrics) to evaluate their impact on classification performance. Experiments demonstrate that although LLM classifiers can learn latent linguistic structures either from raw text or from explicitly provided features, different features contribute unevenly across tasks, which underscores the importance of incorporating more complex linguistic signals during model training.

TL;DR: This paper proposes Self-Explaining Contrastive Evidence Re-Ranking (CER) to enhance retrieval systems by aligning embeddings with factual evidence through contrastive learning and token-level rationales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address hallucinations in retrieval-augmented generation systems and improve reliability in safety-critical domains by ensuring retrieval focuses on factual, evidence-based explanations.

Method: Fine-tunes embeddings via contrastive learning with automatically selected hard negatives (based on subjectivity), generating token-level attribution rationales to restructure retrieval around evidential reasoning.

Result: Demonstrated improved retrieval accuracy, reduced hallucinations, and transparent evidence-based retrieval, particularly effective in clinical trial report applications.

Conclusion: CER successfully aligns embedding spaces with evidential reasoning, offering a reliable solution for critical domains where accuracy and transparency are essential.

Abstract: This extended abstract introduces Self-Explaining Contrastive Evidence Re-Ranking (CER), a novel method that restructures retrieval around factual evidence by fine-tuning embeddings with contrastive learning and generating token-level attribution rationales for each retrieved passage. Hard negatives are automatically selected using a subjectivity-based criterion, forcing the model to pull factual rationales closer while pushing subjective or misleading explanations apart. As a result, the method creates an embedding space explicitly aligned with evidential reasoning. We evaluated our method on clinical trial reports, and initial experimental results show that CER improves retrieval accuracy, mitigates the potential for hallucinations in RAG systems, and provides transparent, evidence-based retrieval that enhances reliability, especially in safety-critical domains.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的推理加速框架Arbitrage，在步骤级预测草稿模型与目标模型的优势，动态选择生成步骤，显著提升大型语言模型的推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推测解码在推理任务中因语义等效步骤的token级冲突导致效率低下，现有步骤级验证方法仍存在大量无效步骤再生，浪费计算资源。

Method: Arbitrage采用轻量级路由模型替代固定接受阈值，通过预测目标模型何时能生成更优步骤动态路由生成过程，近似实现理想仲裁者（Arbitrage Oracle）的最优步骤选择。

Result: 在多个数学推理基准测试中，Arbitrage在相同准确率下将推理延迟降低最多至2倍，且优于现有步骤级推测解码基线方法。

Conclusion: Arbitrage通过动态步骤路由机制有效平衡效率与准确性，为大型语言模型推理提供了新的优化方向。

Abstract: Modern Large Language Models achieve impressive reasoning capabilities with long Chain of Thoughts, but they incur substantial computational cost during inference, and this motivates techniques to improve the performance-cost ratio. Among these techniques, Speculative Decoding accelerates inference by employing a fast but inaccurate draft model to autoregressively propose tokens, which are then verified in parallel by a more capable target model. However, due to unnecessary rejections caused by token mismatches in semantically equivalent steps, traditional token-level Speculative Decoding struggles in reasoning tasks. Although recent works have shifted to step-level semantic verification, which improve efficiency by accepting or rejecting entire reasoning steps, existing step-level methods still regenerate many rejected steps with little improvement, wasting valuable target compute. To address this challenge, we propose Arbitrage, a novel step-level speculative generation framework that routes generation dynamically based on the relative advantage between draft and target models. Instead of applying a fixed acceptance threshold, Arbitrage uses a lightweight router trained to predict when the target model is likely to produce a meaningfully better step. This routing approximates an ideal Arbitrage Oracle that always chooses the higher-quality step, achieving near-optimal efficiency-accuracy trade-offs. Across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, Arbitrage consistently surpasses prior step-level Speculative Decoding baselines, reducing inference latency by up to $\sim2\times$ at matched accuracy.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了FormatRL，一种基于强化学习的方法，通过结构感知奖励优化XML/HTML文档级别的结构化文本翻译。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有结构化文本翻译工作局限于句子级别，难以有效处理复杂的文档级XML或HTML结构，需探索直接优化结构关联指标的方案。

Method: 在监督微调模型基础上引入组相对策略优化（Group Relative Policy Optimization），设计新型结构感知奖励指标TreeSim（XML树结构相似度）、Node-chrF（节点级翻译质量）以及StrucAUC（区分轻度错误与重大结构错误的细粒度指标）。

Result: 在SAP软件文档基准测试中六项指标均取得提升，并通过奖励函数贡献分析验证了结构和翻译质量的协同优化效果。

Conclusion: 证明了结构感知奖励函数与强化学习框架的结合能显著提升文档级结构化文本的翻译效果，兼顾结构完整性和翻译准确性。

Abstract: Recent works on structured text translation remain limited to the sentence level, as they struggle to effectively handle the complex document-level XML or HTML structures. To address this, we propose \textbf{Format Reinforcement Learning (FormatRL)}, which employs Group Relative Policy Optimization on top of a supervised fine-tuning model to directly optimize novel structure-aware rewards: 1) TreeSim, which measures structural similarity between predicted and reference XML trees and 2) Node-chrF, which measures translation quality at the level of XML nodes. Additionally, we apply StrucAUC, a fine-grained metric distinguishing between minor errors and major structural failures. Experiments on the SAP software-documentation benchmark demonstrate improvements across six metrics and an analysis further shows how different reward functions contribute to improvements in both structural and translation quality.
