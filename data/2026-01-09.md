*Chenye Meng,Zejian Li,Zhongni Liu,Yize Li,Changle Xie,Kaixin Jia,Ling Yang,Huanghuang Deng,Shiying Ding,Shengyuan Zhang,Jiayi Li,Lingyun Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了复杂偏好优化（CPO）框架，通过构建分层细粒度评估标准，显著提升扩散模型在图像生成中的专业对齐能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型依赖简化信号（如二元偏好）进行对齐，难以匹配人类专业知识的层级性和细粒度，导致生成结果偏离专业预期。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：1) 监督微调注入领域知识到辅助扩散模型；2) CPO算法扩展DPO，将层级非二元标准转化为联合优化目标，同步提升正属性概率并抑制负属性概率。

Result: 在绘画生成领域实验证明，CPO生成质量超越基线模型，细粒度属性对齐率达到专业标准，且通过消融实验验证了方法有效性。

Conclusion: CPO为复杂层级标准的模型对齐提供了可扩展范式，揭示了细粒度知识注入对生成质量的提升潜力，未来可拓展至其他专业领域。

Abstract: Post-training alignment of diffusion models relies on simplified signals, such as scalar rewards or binary preferences. This limits alignment with complex human expertise, which is hierarchical and fine-grained. To address this, we first construct a hierarchical, fine-grained evaluation criteria with domain experts, which decomposes image quality into multiple positive and negative attributes organized in a tree structure. Building on this, we propose a two-stage alignment framework. First, we inject domain knowledge to an auxiliary diffusion model via Supervised Fine-Tuning. Second, we introduce Complex Preference Optimization (CPO) that extends DPO to align the target diffusion to our non-binary, hierarchical criteria. Specifically, we reformulate the alignment problem to simultaneously maximize the probability of positive attributes while minimizing the probability of negative attributes with the auxiliary diffusion. We instantiate our approach in the domain of painting generation and conduct CPO training with an annotated dataset of painting with fine-grained attributes based on our criteria. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CPO significantly enhances generation quality and alignment with expertise, opening new avenues for fine-grained criteria alignment.

### [2] [Embedding Textual Information in Images Using Quinary Pixel Combinations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04302)
*A V Uday Kiran Kandala*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a quinary RGB pixel intensity combination method for text-image embedding, achieving efficient text hiding per pixel with minimal distortion compared to traditional LSB/MSB or learning-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing steganography methods suffer from computational heaviness, noise artifacts, and multi-pixel requirements. The authors aim to develop a lightweight, single-pixel encoding technique with better imperceptibility.

Method: Utilizes 5 intensity levels in R, G, and B channels (5³=125 combinations) mapped to ASCII characters. Text is encoded through controlled pixel intensity variations within a single RGB pixel, validated through MSE, PSNR, SSIM, and histogram analysis.

Result: Achieved zero perceptible distortion (PSNR~48dB, SSIM~0.998), full character set support (uppercase/lowercase, digits, symbols), and 3-4× higher embedding efficiency compared to LSB/PVD methods.

Conclusion: The quinary combination strategy outperforms conventional methods in embedding capacity (1 character/pixel) and image quality preservation, offering a computationally efficient alternative for secure data hiding.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel technique for embedding textual data into images using quinary combinations of pixel intensities in RGB space. Existing methods predominantly rely on least and most significant bit (LSB & MSB) manipulation, Pixel Value Differencing (PVD), spatial perturbations in RGB channels, transform domain based methods, Quantization methods, Edge and Region based methods and more recently through deep learning methods and generative AI techniques for hiding textual information in spatial domain of images. Most of them are dependent on pixel intensity flipping over multiple pixels, such as LSB and combination of LSB based methodologies, and on transform coefficients, often resulting in the form of noise. Encoding and Decoding are deterministic in most of the existing approaches and are computationally heavy in case of higher models such as deep learning and gen AI approaches. The proposed method works on quinary pixel intensity combinations in RGB space, where five controlled different pixel intensity variations in each of the R, G, and B channels formulate up to one hundred and twenty five distinct pixel intensity combinations. These combinations are mapped to textual symbols, enabling the representation of uppercase and lowercase alphabetic characters, numeric digits, whitespace, and commonly used special characters. Different metrics such as MSE, MAE, SNR, PSNR, SSIM, Histogram Comparison and Heatmap analysis, were evaluated for both original and encoded images resulting in no significant distortion in the images. Furthermore, the method achieves improved embedding efficiency by encoding a complete textual symbol within a single RGB pixel, in contrast to LSB and MSB based approaches that typically require multiple pixels or multi-step processes, as well as transform and learning based methods that incur higher computational overhead.

Conclusion: 联合多模态后训练与策略性数据设计能有效增强图文生成能力，证明奖励加权和自主生成流程对跨模态合成的重要性。

Abstract: Unified multimodal generation architectures that jointly produce text and images have recently emerged as a promising direction for text-to-image (T2I) synthesis. However, many existing systems rely on explicit modality switching, generating reasoning text before switching manually to image generation. This separate, sequential inference process limits cross-modal coupling and prohibits automatic multimodal generation. This work explores post-training to achieve fully unified text-image generation, where models autonomously transition from textual reasoning to visual synthesis within a single inference process. We examine the impact of joint text-image generation on T2I performance and the relative importance of each modality during post-training. We additionally explore different post-training data strategies, showing that a targeted dataset addressing specific limitations achieves superior results compared to broad image-caption corpora or benchmark-aligned data. Using offline, reward-weighted post-training with fully self-generated synthetic data, our approach enables improvements in multimodal image generation across four diverse T2I benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of reward-weighting both modalities and strategically designed post-training data.

### [4] [ReHyAt: Recurrent Hybrid Attention for Video Diffusion Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04342)
*Mohsen Ghafoorian,Amirhossein Habibian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReHyAt introduces a hybrid attention mechanism combining softmax and linear attention for efficient video diffusion models, enabling linear complexity and scalable long-duration generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based video diffusion models suffer from quadratic attention complexity, limiting scalability for longer sequences and practical applications.

Method: ReHyAt integrates softmax attention (for fidelity) and linear attention (for efficiency) with recurrent chunk-wise processing, enabling distillation from existing softmax models and constant memory usage.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art quality on VBench benchmarks and human studies, reduces training cost by 100x (~160 GPU hours), and lowers attention complexity from quadratic to linear.

Conclusion: ReHyAt's hybrid design unlocks scalable, efficient video generation for long durations and on-device deployment, offering a reusable distillation framework for future models.

Abstract: Recent advances in video diffusion models have shifted towards transformer-based architectures, achieving state-of-the-art video generation but at the cost of quadratic attention complexity, which severely limits scalability for longer sequences. We introduce ReHyAt, a Recurrent Hybrid Attention mechanism that combines the fidelity of softmax attention with the efficiency of linear attention, enabling chunk-wise recurrent reformulation and constant memory usage. Unlike the concurrent linear-only SANA Video, ReHyAt's hybrid design allows efficient distillation from existing softmax-based models, reducing the training cost by two orders of magnitude to ~160 GPU hours, while being competitive in the quality. Our light-weight distillation and finetuning pipeline provides a recipe that can be applied to future state-of-the-art bidirectional softmax-based models. Experiments on VBench and VBench-2.0, as well as a human preference study, demonstrate that ReHyAt achieves state-of-the-art video quality while reducing attention cost from quadratic to linear, unlocking practical scalability for long-duration and on-device video generation.

### [5] [SCAR-GS: Spatial Context Attention for Residuals in Progressive Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04348)
*Diego Revilla,Pooja Suresh,Anand Bhojan,Ooi Wei Tsang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于残差向量量化的新型3D高斯点阵渐进压缩编解码器，通过自回归熵模型和多分辨率哈希网格提升了压缩效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有压缩方法（渐进掩码和标量量化）无法有效捕捉高维特征向量相关性，导致率失真性能受限，且大型场景存储需求高阻碍云端部署。

Method: 采用残差矢量量化替代传统标量量化，构建多分辨率哈希网格引导的自回归熵模型，对渐进层传输索引的条件概率进行精准预测，实现高效压缩。

Result: 设计了支持分层压缩的编解码框架，通过矢量量化和概率模型优化，理论上可提升三维高斯表示的率失真效率。

Conclusion: 新方法在保持高保真的前提下显著降低存储需求，为云流媒体场景下的大规模点云压缩提供了解决方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting have allowed for real-time, high-fidelity novel view synthesis. Nonetheless, these models have significant storage requirements for large and medium-sized scenes, hindering their deployment over cloud and streaming services. Some of the most recent progressive compression techniques for these models rely on progressive masking and scalar quantization techniques to reduce the bitrate of Gaussian attributes using spatial context models. While effective, scalar quantization may not optimally capture the correlations of high-dimensional feature vectors, which can potentially limit the rate-distortion performance.
  In this work, we introduce a novel progressive codec for 3D Gaussian Splatting that replaces traditional methods with a more powerful Residual Vector Quantization approach to compress the primitive features. Our key contribution is an auto-regressive entropy model, guided by a multi-resolution hash grid, that accurately predicts the conditional probability of each successive transmitted index, allowing for coarse and refinement layers to be compressed with high efficiency.

### [6] [Comparative Analysis of Custom CNN Architectures versus Pre-trained Models and Transfer Learning: A Study on Five Bangladesh Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04352)
*Ibrahim Tanvir,Alif Ruslan,Sartaj Solaiman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper compares custom CNNs and pre-trained models (ResNet-18, VGG-16) for image classification in Bangladesh. Transfer learning with fine-tuning achieves up to 76% accuracy improvement, though custom models are smaller and faster to train.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine practical trade-offs between model complexity, data constraints, and application-specific performance requirements for image classification tasks in resource-limited domains.

Method: Evaluated custom CNNs vs. ResNet-18/VGG-16 using feature extraction/transfer learning across 5 Bangladeshi datasets. Measured accuracy, parameter count (3.4M vs 11-134M), and training efficiency.

Result: Transfer learning with fine-tuning improved accuracy by 3-76% over custom/feature extraction methods. ResNet-18 achieved 100% accuracy on Road Damage BD dataset. Custom CNNs trained faster but underperformed on complex tasks.

Conclusion: Pre-trained models with transfer learning provide superior accuracy, especially for complex tasks with limited data. Custom CNNs remain viable for simple tasks where computational efficiency is critical.

Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of custom-built Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) against popular pre-trained architectures (ResNet-18 and VGG-16) using both feature extraction and transfer learning approaches. We evaluated these models across five diverse image classification datasets from Bangladesh: Footpath Vision, Auto Rickshaw Detection, Mango Image Classification, Paddy Variety Recognition, and Road Damage Detection. Our experimental results demonstrate that transfer learning with fine-tuning consistently outperforms both custom CNNs built from scratch and feature extraction methods, achieving accuracy improvements ranging from 3% to 76% across different datasets. Notably, ResNet-18 with fine-tuning achieved perfect 100% accuracy on the Road Damage BD dataset. While custom CNNs offer advantages in model size (3.4M parameters vs. 11-134M for pre-trained models) and training efficiency on simpler tasks, pre-trained models with transfer learning provide superior performance, particularly on complex classification tasks with limited training data. This research provides practical insights for practitioners in selecting appropriate deep learning approaches based on dataset characteristics, computational resources, and performance requirements.

### [7] [PackCache: A Training-Free Acceleration Method for Unified Autoregressive Video Generation via Compact KV-Cache](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04359)
*Kunyang Li,Mubarak Shah,Yuzhang Shang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PackCache通过动态压缩KV缓存，在保证生成质量的前提下提升统一自回归模型在视频生成中的推理效率，实现1.7-2.2倍的端到端加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 统一自回归模型的KV缓存随生成token线性增长，成为限制推理效率和生成长度的瓶颈。

Method: 提出无训练的PackCache，融合条件锚定（保留语义锚点）、跨帧衰减建模（按时间距离分配缓存预算）及空间位置嵌入保护（保持3D结构连贯）三机制协调压缩缓存

Result: 48帧视频生成中后四帧（成本最高部分）在A40/H200显卡实现2.6x/3.7x加速，整体端到端加速1.7-2.2倍

Conclusion: PackCache突破KV缓存瓶颈，在保持生成质量的同时显著提升多模态统一自回归模型的长序列生成效率

Abstract: A unified autoregressive model is a Transformer-based framework that addresses diverse multimodal tasks (e.g., text, image, video) as a single sequence modeling problem under a shared token space. Such models rely on the KV-cache mechanism to reduce attention computation from O(T^2) to O(T); however, KV-cache size grows linearly with the number of generated tokens, and it rapidly becomes the dominant bottleneck limiting inference efficiency and generative length. Unified autoregressive video generation inherits this limitation. Our analysis reveals that KV-cache tokens exhibit distinct spatiotemporal properties: (i) text and conditioning-image tokens act as persistent semantic anchors that consistently receive high attention, and (ii) attention to previous frames naturally decays with temporal distance. Leveraging these observations, we introduce PackCache, a training-free KV-cache management method that dynamically compacts the KV cache through three coordinated mechanisms: condition anchoring that preserves semantic references, cross-frame decay modeling that allocates cache budget according to temporal distance, and spatially preserving position embedding that maintains coherent 3D structure under cache removal. In terms of efficiency, PackCache accelerates end-to-end generation by 1.7-2.2x on 48-frame long sequences, showcasing its strong potential for enabling longer-sequence video generation. Notably, the final four frames - the portion most impacted by the progressively expanding KV-cache and thus the most expensive segment of the clip - PackCache delivers a 2.6x and 3.7x acceleration on A40 and H200, respectively, for 48-frame videos.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 压力识别难点在于其主观性和面部表情可控性，传统方法依赖面部动作单元（AUs）但未充分挖掘3D面部几何特征。研究旨在探索驾驶情境下3D面部特征与压力的关系，并验证时序建模及多模态融合方法对压力识别的提升效果。

Method: 1) 使用EMOCA从面部视频提取56维3D表情/姿态系数；2) 通过基线与压力刺激阶段的配对假设检验筛选压力相关系数；3) 构建Transformer时序模型，比较单模态、早融合和跨模态注意力策略；4) 融合EMOCA、生理信号及眼动数据进行压力分类。

Conclusion: 3D面部几何特征（尤其姿态系数）包含压力相关生物标记物，基于Transformer的时序建模和跨模态注意力能有效融合多源数据提升压力识别性能。为驾驶安全监测等实际应用提供了新范式，未来需进一步探索动态面部特征的时序建模机制。

Abstract: Reliable stress recognition from facial videos is challenging due to stress's subjective nature and voluntary facial control. While most methods rely on Facial Action Units, the role of disentangled 3D facial geometry remains underexplored. We address this by analyzing stress during distracted driving using EMOCA-derived 3D expression and pose coefficients. Paired hypothesis tests between baseline and stressor phases reveal that 41 of 56 coefficients show consistent, phase-specific stress responses comparable to physiological markers. Building on this, we propose a Transformer-based temporal modeling framework and assess unimodal, early-fusion, and cross-modal attention strategies. Cross-Modal Attention fusion of EMOCA and physiological signals achieves best performance (AUROC 92\%, Accuracy 86.7\%), with EMOCA-gaze fusion also competitive (AUROC 91.8\%). This highlights the effectiveness of temporal modeling and cross-modal attention for stress recognition.

### [9] [Few-Shot LoRA Adaptation of a Flow-Matching Foundation Model for Cross-Spectral Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04381)
*Maxim Clouser,Kia Khezeli,John Kalantari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究通过在预训练的流匹配基础模型上添加低秩自适应（LoRA）模块，仅使用100对跨模态图像对（RGB→红外/合成孔径雷达），成功实现了跨光谱翻译，并通过生成的合成数据提升了目标检测性能，表明流匹配模型的小样本适配在非可见光模态中具有应用潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉基础模型主要依赖RGB数据训练，但安全关键场景（如夜间监控、雷达成像）需依赖非可见光模态（如红外/合成孔径雷达）。本研究旨在验证是否可通过少量配对数据，快速适配RGB基础模型实现跨光谱翻译，并利用合成数据增强目标检测。

Method: 基于FLUX.1基础模型插入LoRA模块，在KAIST（RGB→红外）和M4-SAR（RGB→合成孔径雷达）数据集上各使用100对配准图像进行微调。通过LPIPS指标评估翻译质量，并利用生成的合成数据训练YOLOv11n和DETR检测模型。

Result: 实验发现LPIPS值与目标检测性能（mAP）强负相关：更低的LPIPS预测更高的检测精度。合成红外数据提升KAIST行人检测，合成SAR数据与少量真实SAR结合后显著增强M4-SAR的基础设施检测。

Conclusion: 流匹配基础模型通过小样本LoRA适配可有效支持非可见光模态任务，为构建跨光谱基础模型提供了无需大规模标注数据的可行路径。

Abstract: Foundation models for vision are predominantly trained on RGB data, while many safety-critical applications rely on non-visible modalities such as infrared (IR) and synthetic aperture radar (SAR). We study whether a single flow-matching foundation model pre-trained primarily on RGB images can be repurposed as a cross-spectral translator using only a few co-measured examples, and whether the resulting synthetic data can enhance downstream detection. Starting from FLUX.1 Kontext, we insert low-rank adaptation (LoRA) modules and fine-tune them on just 100 paired images per domain for two settings: RGB to IR on the KAIST dataset and RGB to SAR on the M4-SAR dataset. The adapted model translates RGB images into pixel-aligned IR/SAR, enabling us to reuse existing bounding boxes and train object detection models purely in the target modality. Across a grid of LoRA hyperparameters, we find that LPIPS computed on only 50 held-out pairs is a strong proxy for downstream performance: lower LPIPS consistently predicts higher mAP for YOLOv11n on both IR and SAR, and for DETR on KAIST IR test data. Using the best LPIPS-selected LoRA adapter, synthetic IR from external RGB datasets (LLVIP, FLIR ADAS) improves KAIST IR pedestrian detection, and synthetic SAR significantly boosts infrastructure detection on M4-SAR when combined with limited real SAR. Our results suggest that few-shot LoRA adaptation of flow-matching foundation models is a promising path toward foundation-style support for non-visible modalities.

Method: 构建从零训练的定制CNN，并通过迁移学习调用预训练模型，在相同实验条件下进行对比，使用准确率、精度、召回率、F1分数评估性能。

Result: 预训练模型在准确率和收敛速度上表现更优（尤其在数据量少时），而定制模型参数更少且计算复杂度更低。

Conclusion: 在模型复杂度、性能与计算效率之间存在权衡，推荐：（1）小数据集优先选择预训练模型；（2）资源受限场景可考虑简化模型设计。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success in image classification tasks; however, the choice between designing a custom CNN from scratch and employing established pre-trained architectures remains an important practical consideration. In this work, we present a comparative analysis of a custom-designed CNN and several widely used deep learning architectures, including VGG-16, ResNet-50, and MobileNet, for an image classification task. The custom CNN is developed and trained from scratch, while the popular architectures are employed using transfer learning under identical experimental settings. All models are evaluated using standard performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Experimental results show that pre-trained CNN architectures consistently outperform the custom CNN in terms of classification accuracy and convergence speed, particularly when training data is limited. However, the custom CNN demonstrates competitive performance with significantly fewer parameters and reduced computational complexity. This study highlights the trade-offs between model complexity, performance, and computational efficiency, and provides practical insights into selecting appropriate CNN architectures for image classification problems.

Abstract: Cochlear Implant (CI) surgery treats severe hearing loss by inserting an electrode array into the cochlea to stimulate the auditory nerve. An important step in this procedure is mastoidectomy, which removes part of the mastoid region of the temporal bone to provide surgical access. Accurate mastoidectomy shape prediction from preoperative imaging improves pre-surgical planning, reduces risks, and enhances surgical outcomes. Despite its importance, there are limited deep-learning-based studies regarding this topic due to the challenges of acquiring ground-truth labels. We address this gap by investigating self-supervised and weakly-supervised learning models to predict the mastoidectomy region without human annotations. We propose a hybrid self-supervised and weakly-supervised learning framework to predict the mastoidectomy region directly from preoperative CT scans, where the mastoid remains intact. Our hybrid method achieves a mean Dice score of 0.72 when predicting the complex and boundary-less mastoidectomy shape, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches and demonstrating strong performance. The method provides groundwork for constructing 3D postmastoidectomy surfaces directly from the corresponding preoperative CT scans. To our knowledge, this is the first work that integrating self-supervised and weakly-supervised learning for mastoidectomy shape prediction, offering a robust and efficient solution for CI surgical planning while leveraging 3D T-distribution loss in weakly-supervised medical imaging.

Conclusion: CRUNet-MR-Univ展现了解决CMR重建泛化性问题的潜力，为医学影像分析中基础模型的开发提供了新思路。

Abstract: In recent years, deep learning has attracted increasing at- tention in the field of Cardiac MRI (CMR) reconstruction due to its superior performance over traditional methods, particularly in handling higher acceleration factors, highlighting its potential for real-world clini- cal applications. However, current deep learning methods remain limited in generalizability. CMR scans exhibit wide variability in image contrast, sampling patterns, scanner vendors, anatomical structures, and disease types. Most existing models are designed to handle only a single or nar- row subset of these variations, leading to performance degradation when faced with distribution shifts. Therefore, it is beneficial to develop a unified model capable of generalizing across diverse CMR scenarios. To this end, we propose CRUNet-MR-Univ, a foundation model that lever- ages spatio-temporal correlations and prompt-based priors to effectively handle the full diversity of CMR scans. Our approach consistently out- performs baseline methods across a wide range of settings, highlighting its effectiveness and promise.

### [14] [Addressing Overthinking in Large Vision-Language Models via Gated Perception-Reasoning Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04442)
*Xingjian Diao,Zheyuan Liu,Chunhui Zhang,Weiyi Wu,Keyi Kong,Lin Shi,Kaize Ding,Soroush Vosoughi,Jiang Gui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes GPRO to address overthinking in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) caused by visual perception errors, achieving improved accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs using chain-of-thought reasoning often produce verbose responses due to overthinking, stemming from visual perception failures rather than insufficient deliberation.

Method: GPRO introduces a meta-reasoning controller with three decision paths (fast, slow perception, slow reasoning) and uses 790k samples with reinforcement learning to balance accuracy and computational cost.

Result: Experiments show GPRO significantly enhances both accuracy and efficiency, outperforming existing slow-thinking methods with shorter responses.

Conclusion: Addressing visual perception failures is critical for stable LVLM reasoning; GPRO's dynamic computation routing improves system reliability and resource optimization.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have exhibited strong reasoning capabilities through chain-of-thought mechanisms that generate step-by-step rationales. However, such slow-thinking approaches often lead to overthinking, where models produce excessively verbose responses even for simple queries, resulting in test-time inefficiency and even degraded accuracy. Prior work has attempted to mitigate this issue via adaptive reasoning strategies, but these methods largely overlook a fundamental bottleneck: visual perception failures. We argue that stable reasoning critically depends on low-level visual grounding, and that reasoning errors often originate from imperfect perception rather than insufficient deliberation. To address this limitation, we propose Gated Perception-Reasoning Optimization (GPRO), a meta-reasoning controller that dynamically routes computation among three decision paths at each generation step: a lightweight fast path, a slow perception path for re-examining visual inputs, and a slow reasoning path for internal self-reflection. To learn this distinction, we derive large-scale failure attribution supervision from approximately 790k samples, using teacher models to distinguish perceptual hallucinations from reasoning errors. We then train the controller with multi-objective reinforcement learning to optimize the trade-off between task accuracy and computational cost under uncertainty. Experiments on five benchmarks demonstrate that GPRO substantially improves both accuracy and efficiency, outperforming recent slow-thinking methods while generating significantly shorter responses.

Abstract: World models have become central to autonomous driving, where accurate scene understanding and future prediction are crucial for safe control. Recent work has explored using vision-language models (VLMs) for planning, yet existing approaches typically treat perception, prediction, and planning as separate modules. We propose UniDrive-WM, a unified VLM-based world model that jointly performs driving-scene understanding, trajectory planning, and trajectory-conditioned future image generation within a single architecture. UniDrive-WM's trajectory planner predicts a future trajectory, which conditions a VLM-based image generator to produce plausible future frames. These predictions provide additional supervisory signals that enhance scene understanding and iteratively refine trajectory generation. We further compare discrete and continuous output representations for future image prediction, analyzing their influence on downstream driving performance. Experiments on the challenging Bench2Drive benchmark show that UniDrive-WM produces high-fidelity future images and improves planning performance by 5.9% in L2 trajectory error and 9.2% in collision rate over the previous best method. These results demonstrate the advantages of tightly integrating VLM-driven reasoning, planning, and generative world modeling for autonomous driving.

Abstract: Modern forest monitoring workflows increasingly benefit from the growing availability of high-resolution satellite imagery and advances in deep learning. Two persistent challenges in this context are accurate pixel-level change detection and meaningful semantic change captioning for complex forest dynamics. While large language models (LLMs) are being adapted for interactive data exploration, their integration with vision-language models (VLMs) for remote sensing image change interpretation (RSICI) remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce an LLM-driven agent for integrated forest change analysis that supports natural language querying across multiple RSICI tasks. The proposed system builds upon a multi-level change interpretation (MCI) vision-language backbone with LLM-based orchestration. To facilitate adaptation and evaluation in forest environments, we further introduce the Forest-Change dataset, which comprises bi-temporal satellite imagery, pixel-level change masks, and multi-granularity semantic change captions generated using a combination of human annotation and rule-based methods. Experimental results show that the proposed system achieves mIoU and BLEU-4 scores of 67.10% and 40.17% on the Forest-Change dataset, and 88.13% and 34.41% on LEVIR-MCI-Trees, a tree-focused subset of LEVIR-MCI benchmark for joint change detection and captioning. These results highlight the potential of interactive, LLM-driven RSICI systems to improve accessibility, interpretability, and efficiency of forest change analysis.

Abstract: Three-dimensional medical image segmentation is a fundamental yet computationally demanding task due to the cubic growth of voxel processing and the redundant computation on homogeneous regions. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{TokenSeg}, a boundary-aware sparse token representation framework for efficient 3D medical volume segmentation. Specifically, (1) we design a \emph{multi-scale hierarchical encoder} that extracts 400 candidate tokens across four resolution levels to capture both global anatomical context and fine boundary details; (2) we introduce a \emph{boundary-aware tokenizer} that combines VQ-VAE quantization with importance scoring to select 100 salient tokens, over 60\% of which lie near tumor boundaries; and (3) we develop a \emph{sparse-to-dense decoder} that reconstructs full-resolution masks through token reprojection, progressive upsampling, and skip connections. Extensive experiments on a 3D breast DCE-MRI dataset comprising 960 cases demonstrate that TokenSeg achieves state-of-the-art performance with 94.49\% Dice and 89.61\% IoU, while reducing GPU memory and inference latency by 64\% and 68\%, respectively. To verify the generalization capability, our evaluations on MSD cardiac and brain MRI benchmark datasets demonstrate that TokenSeg consistently delivers optimal performance across heterogeneous anatomical structures. These results highlight the effectiveness of anatomically informed sparse representation for accurate and efficient 3D medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Recent facial texture generation methods prefer to use deep networks to synthesize image content and then fill in the UV map, thus generating a compelling full texture from a single image. Nevertheless, the synthesized texture UV map usually comes from a space constructed by the training data or the 2D face generator, which limits the methods' generalization ability for in-the-wild input images. Consequently, their facial details, structures and identity may not be consistent with the input. In this paper, we address this issue by proposing a style transfer-based facial texture refinement method named FaceRefiner. FaceRefiner treats the 3D sampled texture as style and the output of a texture generation method as content. The photo-realistic style is then expected to be transferred from the style image to the content image. Different from current style transfer methods that only transfer high and middle level information to the result, our style transfer method integrates differentiable rendering to also transfer low level (or pixel level) information in the visible face regions. The main benefit of such multi-level information transfer is that, the details, structures and semantics in the input can thus be well preserved. The extensive experiments on Multi-PIE, CelebA and FFHQ datasets demonstrate that our refinement method can improve the texture quality and the face identity preserving ability, compared with state-of-the-arts.

Abstract: Segmentation of the left atrial (LA) wall and endocardium from late gadolinium-enhanced (LGE) MRI is essential for quantifying atrial fibrosis in patients with atrial fibrillation. The development of accurate machine learning-based segmentation models remains challenging due to the limited availability of data and the complexity of anatomical structures. In this work, we investigate 3D conditional generative models as potential solution for augmenting scarce LGE training data and improving LA segmentation performance. We develop a pipeline to synthesize high-fidelity 3D LGE MRI volumes from composite semantic label maps combining anatomical expert annotations with unsupervised tissue clusters, using three 3D conditional generators (Pix2Pix GAN, SPADE-GAN, and SPADE-LDM). The synthetic images are evaluated for realism and their impact on downstream LA segmentation. SPADE-LDM generates the most realistic and structurally accurate images, achieving an FID of 4.063 and surpassing GAN models, which have FIDs of 40.821 and 7.652 for Pix2Pix and SPADE-GAN, respectively. When augmented with synthetic LGE images, the Dice score for LA cavity segmentation with a 3D U-Net model improved from 0.908 to 0.936, showing a statistically significant improvement (p < 0.05) over the baseline.These findings demonstrate the potential of label-conditioned 3D synthesis to enhance the segmentation of under-represented cardiac structures.

Abstract: Real-world design documents (e.g., posters) are inherently multi-layered, combining decoration, text, and images. Editing them from natural-language instructions requires fine-grained, layer-aware reasoning to identify relevant layers and coordinate modifications. Prior work largely overlooks multi-layer design document editing, focusing instead on single-layer image editing or multi-layer generation, which assume a flat canvas and lack the reasoning needed to determine what and where to modify. To address this gap, we introduce the Multi-Layer Document Editing Agent (MiLDEAgent), a reasoning-based framework that combines an RL-trained multimodal reasoner for layer-wise understanding with an image editor for targeted modifications. To systematically benchmark this setting, we introduce the MiLDEBench, a human-in-the-loop corpus of over 20K design documents paired with diverse editing instructions. The benchmark is complemented by a task-specific evaluation protocol, MiLDEEval, which spans four dimensions including instruction following, layout consistency, aesthetics, and text rendering. Extensive experiments on 14 open-source and 2 closed-source models reveal that existing approaches fail to generalize: open-source models often cannot complete multi-layer document editing tasks, while closed-source models suffer from format violations. In contrast, MiLDEAgent achieves strong layer-aware reasoning and precise editing, significantly outperforming all open-source baselines and attaining performance comparable to closed-source models, thereby establishing the first strong baseline for multi-layer document editing.

Abstract: In recent years, Human-centric cyber-physical systems have increasingly involved artificial intelligence to enable knowledge extraction from sensor-collected data. Examples include medical monitoring and control systems, as well as autonomous cars. Such systems are intended to operate according to the protocols and guidelines for regular system operations. However, in many scenarios, such as closed-loop blood glucose control for Type 1 diabetics, self-driving cars, and monitoring systems for stroke diagnosis. The operations of such AI-enabled human-centric applications can expose them to cases for which their operational mode may be uncertain, for instance, resulting from the interactions with a human with the system. Such cases, in which the system is in uncertain conditions, can violate the system's safety and security requirements. 
  This paper will discuss operational deviations that can lead these systems to operate in unknown conditions. We will then create a framework to evaluate different strategies for ensuring the safety and security of AI-enabled human-centric cyber-physical systems in operation deployment. Then, as an example, we show a personalized image-based novel technique for detecting the non-announcement of meals in closed-loop blood glucose control for Type 1 diabetics.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of organs at risk in the head and neck is essential for radiation therapy, yet deep learning models often fail on small, complexly shaped organs. While hybrid architectures that combine different models show promise, they typically just concatenate features without exploiting the unique strengths of each component. This results in functional overlap and limited segmentation accuracy. To address these issues, we propose a high uncertainty region-guided multi-architecture collaborative learning (HUR-MACL) model for multi-organ segmentation in the head and neck. This model adaptively identifies high uncertainty regions using a convolutional neural network, and for these regions, Vision Mamba as well as Deformable CNN are utilized to jointly improve their segmentation accuracy. Additionally, a heterogeneous feature distillation loss was proposed to promote collaborative learning between the two architectures in high uncertainty regions to further enhance performance. Our method achieves SOTA results on two public datasets and one private dataset.

Abstract: With the rapid development of text-to-image generation technology, accurately assessing the alignment between generated images and text prompts has become a critical challenge. Existing methods rely on Euclidean space metrics, neglecting the structured nature of semantic alignment, while lacking adaptive capabilities for different samples. To address these limitations, we propose HyperAlign, an adaptive text-to-image alignment assessment framework based on hyperbolic entailment geometry. First, we extract Euclidean features using CLIP and map them to hyperbolic space. Second, we design a dynamic-supervision entailment modeling mechanism that transforms discrete entailment logic into continuous geometric structure supervision. Finally, we propose an adaptive modulation regressor that utilizes hyperbolic geometric features to generate sample-level modulation parameters, adaptively calibrating Euclidean cosine similarity to predict the final score. HyperAlign achieves highly competitive performance on both single database evaluation and cross-database generalization tasks, fully validating the effectiveness of hyperbolic geometric modeling for image-text alignment assessment.

Abstract: Agricultural disease diagnosis challenges VLMs, as conventional fine-tuning requires extensive labels, lacks interpretability, and generalizes poorly. While reasoning improves model robustness, existing methods rely on costly expert annotations and rarely address the open-ended, diverse nature of agricultural queries. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{Agri-R1}, a reasoning-enhanced large model for agriculture. Our framework automates high-quality reasoning data generation via vision-language synthesis and LLM-based filtering, using only 19\% of available samples. Training employs Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a novel proposed reward function that integrates domain-specific lexicons and fuzzy matching to assess both correctness and linguistic flexibility in open-ended responses. Evaluated on CDDMBench, our resulting 3B-parameter model achieves performance competitive with 7B- to 13B-parameter baselines, showing a +23.2\% relative gain in disease recognition accuracy, +33.3\% in agricultural knowledge QA, and a +26.10-point improvement in cross-domain generalization over standard fine-tuning. Ablation studies confirm that the synergy between structured reasoning data and GRPO-driven exploration underpins these gains, with benefits scaling as question complexity increases.

Abstract: Infrared video has been of great interest in visual tasks under challenging environments, but often suffers from severe atmospheric turbulence and compression degradation. Existing video super-resolution (VSR) methods either neglect the inherent modality gap between infrared and visible images or fail to restore turbulence-induced distortions. Directly cascading turbulence mitigation (TM) algorithms with VSR methods leads to error propagation and accumulation due to the decoupled modeling of degradation between turbulence and resolution. We introduce HATIR, a Heat-Aware Diffusion for Turbulent InfraRed Video Super-Resolution, which injects heat-aware deformation priors into the diffusion sampling path to jointly model the inverse process of turbulent degradation and structural detail loss. Specifically, HATIR constructs a Phasor-Guided Flow Estimator, rooted in the physical principle that thermally active regions exhibit consistent phasor responses over time, enabling reliable turbulence-aware flow to guide the reverse diffusion process. To ensure the fidelity of structural recovery under nonuniform distortions, a Turbulence-Aware Decoder is proposed to selectively suppress unstable temporal cues and enhance edge-aware feature aggregation via turbulence gating and structure-aware attention. We built FLIR-IVSR, the first dataset for turbulent infrared VSR, comprising paired LR-HR sequences from a FLIR T1050sc camera (1024 X 768) spanning 640 diverse scenes with varying camera and object motion conditions. This encourages future research in infrared VSR. Project page: https://github.com/JZ0606/HATIR

Abstract: Integrating image generation and understanding into a single framework has become a pivotal goal in the multimodal domain. However, how understanding can effectively assist generation has not been fully explored. Unlike previous works that focus on leveraging reasoning abilities and world knowledge from understanding models, this paper introduces a novel perspective: leveraging understanding to enhance the fidelity and detail richness of generated images. To this end, we propose Forge-and-Quench, a new unified framework that puts this principle into practice. In the generation process of our framework, an MLLM first reasons over the entire conversational context, including text instructions, to produce an enhanced text instruction. This refined instruction is then mapped to a virtual visual representation, termed the Bridge Feature, via a novel Bridge Adapter. This feature acts as a crucial link, forging insights from the understanding model to quench and refine the generation process. It is subsequently injected into the T2I backbone as a visual guidance signal, alongside the enhanced text instruction that replaces the original input. To validate this paradigm, we conduct comprehensive studies on the design of the Bridge Feature and Bridge Adapter. Our framework demonstrates exceptional extensibility and flexibility, enabling efficient migration across different MLLM and T2I models with significant savings in training overhead, all without compromising the MLLM's inherent multimodal understanding capabilities. Experiments show that Forge-and-Quench significantly improves image fidelity and detail across multiple models, while also maintaining instruction-following accuracy and enhancing world knowledge application.

Result: Custom lightweight CNN achieved competitive performance across domains. Transfer learning and deep architectures showed significant performance gains in data-constrained environments. Model depth/architectural complexity trade-offs varied by task difficulty and dataset size.

Conclusion: Provides practical guidelines for deploying deep learning in resource-limited high-impact visual classification tasks. Demonstrates transfer learning's value when training data is limited, while custom CNNs offer efficient multi-domain adaptability.

Abstract: Deep learning has transformed visual data analysis, with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) becoming highly effective in learning meaningful feature representations directly from images. Unlike traditional manual feature engineering methods, CNNs automatically extract hierarchical visual patterns, enabling strong performance across diverse real-world contexts. This study investigates the effectiveness of CNN-based architectures across five heterogeneous datasets spanning agricultural and urban domains: mango variety classification, paddy variety identification, road surface condition assessment, auto-rickshaw detection, and footpath encroachment monitoring. These datasets introduce varying challenges, including differences in illumination, resolution, environmental complexity, and class imbalance, necessitating adaptable and robust learning models.
  We evaluate a lightweight, task-specific custom CNN alongside established deep architectures, including ResNet-18 and VGG-16, trained both from scratch and using transfer learning. Through systematic preprocessing, augmentation, and controlled experimentation, we analyze how architectural complexity, model depth, and pre-training influence convergence, generalization, and performance across datasets of differing scale and difficulty. The key contributions of this work are: (1) the development of an efficient custom CNN that achieves competitive performance across multiple application domains, and (2) a comprehensive comparative analysis highlighting when transfer learning and deep architectures provide substantial advantages, particularly in data-constrained environments. These findings offer practical insights for deploying deep learning models in resource-limited yet high-impact real-world visual classification tasks.

Conclusion: AIVD successfully bridges the gap between accurate localization and efficient multimodal reasoning through edge-cloud collaboration, demonstrating practicality for real-world deployment with dynamic resource adaptation.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate exceptional capabilities in semantic understanding and visual reasoning, yet they still face challenges in precise object localization and resource-constrained edge-cloud deployment. To address this, this paper proposes the AIVD framework, which achieves unified precise localization and high-quality semantic generation through the collaboration between lightweight edge detectors and cloud-based MLLMs. To enhance the cloud MLLM's robustness against edge cropped-box noise and scenario variations, we design an efficient fine-tuning strategy with visual-semantic collaborative augmentation, significantly improving classification accuracy and semantic consistency. Furthermore, to maintain high throughput and low latency across heterogeneous edge devices and dynamic network conditions, we propose a heterogeneous resource-aware dynamic scheduling algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that AIVD substantially reduces resource consumption while improving MLLM classification performance and semantic generation quality. The proposed scheduling strategy also achieves higher throughput and lower latency across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: We present ProFuse, an efficient context-aware framework for open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). The pipeline enhances cross-view consistency and intra-mask cohesion within a direct registration setup, adding minimal overhead and requiring no render-supervised fine-tuning. Instead of relying on a pretrained 3DGS scene, we introduce a dense correspondence-guided pre-registration phase that initializes Gaussians with accurate geometry while jointly constructing 3D Context Proposals via cross-view clustering. Each proposal carries a global feature obtained through weighted aggregation of member embeddings, and this feature is fused onto Gaussians during direct registration to maintain per-primitive language coherence across views. With associations established in advance, semantic fusion requires no additional optimization beyond standard reconstruction, and the model retains geometric refinement without densification. ProFuse achieves strong open-vocabulary 3DGS understanding while completing semantic attachment in about five minutes per scene, which is two times faster than SOTA.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive progress in single-image grounding and general multi-image understanding. Recently, some methods begin to address multi-image grounding. However, they are constrained by single-target localization and limited types of practical tasks, due to the lack of unified modeling for generalized grounding tasks. Therefore, we propose GeM-VG, an MLLM capable of Generalized Multi-image Visual Grounding. To support this, we systematically categorize and organize existing multi-image grounding tasks according to their reliance of cross-image cues and reasoning, and introduce the MG-Data-240K dataset, addressing the limitations of existing datasets regarding target quantity and image relation. To tackle the challenges of robustly handling diverse multi-image grounding tasks, we further propose a hybrid reinforcement finetuning strategy that integrates chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and direct answering, considering their complementary strengths. This strategy adopts an R1-like algorithm guided by a carefully designed rule-based reward, effectively enhancing the model's overall perception and reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior generalized grounding capabilities of our model. For multi-image grounding, it outperforms the previous leading MLLMs by 2.0% and 9.7% on MIG-Bench and MC-Bench, respectively. In single-image grounding, it achieves a 9.1% improvement over the base model on ODINW. Furthermore, our model retains strong capabilities in general multi-image understanding.

Abstract: Video-language models (VLMs) achieve strong multimodal understanding but remain prone to hallucinations, especially when reasoning about actions and temporal order. Existing mitigation strategies, such as textual filtering or random video perturbations, often fail to address the root cause: over-reliance on language priors rather than fine-grained visual dynamics. We propose a scalable framework for counterfactual video generation that synthesizes videos differing only in actions or temporal structure while preserving scene context. Our pipeline combines multimodal LLMs for action proposal and editing guidance with diffusion-based image and video models to generate semantic hard negatives at scale. Using this framework, we build CounterVid, a synthetic dataset of ~26k preference pairs targeting action recognition and temporal reasoning. We further introduce MixDPO, a unified Direct Preference Optimization approach that jointly leverages textual and visual preferences. Fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL with MixDPO yields consistent improvements, notably in temporal ordering, and transfers effectively to standard video hallucination benchmarks. Code and models will be made publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper validates the Gaussian model's accuracy for defocus blur analysis in 3D depth recovery, showing less than 1% error rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Depth estimation from 2D images remains challenging due to ambiguity between defocus blur and inherent blur, prompting the need for a robust computational model.

Method: Established Gaussian defocus operator settings for conventional cameras through geometric optics analysis and tested model accuracy via defocus aberration theory.

Result: Achieved <1% mean absolute error in depth estimation for scenes with 1-100m depths and 10% depth variation, confirming Gaussian model's reliability.

Conclusion: Gaussian model provides optimal balance of mathematical simplicity and accuracy for both absolute/relative defocus blur analysis in real-time applications.

Abstract: Over the past three decades, defocus has consistently provided groundbreaking depth information in scene images. However, accurately estimating depth from 2D images continues to be a persistent and fundamental challenge in the field of 3D recovery. Heuristic approaches involve with the ill-posed problem for inferring the spatial variant defocusing blur, as the desired blur cannot be distinguished from the inherent blur. Given a prior knowledge of the defocus model, the problem become well-posed with an analytic solution for the relative blur between two images, taken at the same viewpoint with different camera settings for the focus. The Gaussian model stands out as an optimal choice for real-time applications, due to its mathematical simplicity and computational efficiency. And theoretically, it is the only model can be applied at the same time to both the absolute blur caused by depth in a single image and the relative blur resulting from depth differences between two images. This paper introduces the settings, for conventional imaging devices, to ensure that the defocusing operator adheres to the Gaussian model. Defocus analysis begins within the framework of geometric optics and is conducted by defocus aberration theory in diffraction-limited optics to obtain the accuracy of fitting the actual model to its Gaussian approximation. The results for a typical set of focused depths between $1$ and $100$ meters, with a maximum depth variation of $10\%$ at the focused depth, confirm the Gaussian model's applicability for defocus operators in most imaging devices. The findings demonstrate a maximum Mean Absolute Error $(\!M\!A\!E)$ of less than $1\%$, underscoring the model's accuracy and reliability.

Conclusion: 通过模块创新与结构优化，成功扩展了Pix2Pix在医学图像转换领域的适用性，为缓解MRI采集限制提供了新方法。

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) provides detailed tissue information, but its clinical application is limited by long acquisition time, high cost, and restricted resolution. Image translation has recently gained attention as a strategy to address these limitations. Although Pix2Pix has been widely applied in medical image translation, its potential has not been fully explored. In this study, we propose an enhanced Pix2Pix framework that integrates Squeeze-and-Excitation Residual Networks (SEResNet) and U-Net++ to improve image generation quality and structural fidelity. SEResNet strengthens critical feature representation through channel attention, while U-Net++ enhances multi-scale feature fusion. A simplified PatchGAN discriminator further stabilizes training and refines local anatomical realism. Experimental results demonstrate that under few-shot conditions with fewer than 500 images, the proposed method achieves consistent structural fidelity and superior image quality across multiple intra-modality MRI translation tasks, showing strong generalization ability. These results suggest an effective extension of Pix2Pix for medical image translation.

Conclusion: MCLC为提升零样本反问题求解器的鲁棒性提供了关键步骤，解决了潜在空间模型的稳定性问题。

Abstract: With recent advances in generative models, diffusion models have emerged as powerful priors for solving inverse problems in each domain. Since Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) provide generic priors, several studies have explored their potential as domain-agnostic zero-shot inverse solvers. Despite these efforts, existing latent diffusion inverse solvers suffer from their instability, exhibiting undesirable artifacts and degraded quality. In this work, we first identify the instability as a discrepancy between the solver's and true reverse diffusion dynamics, and show that reducing this gap stabilizes the solver. Building on this, we introduce Measurement-Consistent Langevin Corrector (MCLC), a theoretically grounded plug-and-play correction module that remedies the LDM-based inverse solvers through measurement-consistent Langevin updates. Compared to prior approaches that rely on linear manifold assumptions, which often do not hold in latent space, MCLC operates without this assumption, leading to more stable and reliable behavior. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of MCLC and its compatibility with existing solvers across diverse image restoration tasks. Additionally, we analyze blob artifacts and offer insights into their underlying causes. We highlight that MCLC is a key step toward more robust zero-shot inverse problem solvers.

Conclusion: 分层金字塔架构适配预训练模型可有效平衡计算成本与生成质量，逐步蒸馏策略对模型压缩有关键作用。

Abstract: Recently proposed pyramidal models decompose the conventional forward and backward diffusion processes into multiple stages operating at varying resolutions. These models handle inputs with higher noise levels at lower resolutions, while less noisy inputs are processed at higher resolutions. This hierarchical approach significantly reduces the computational cost of inference in multi-step denoising models. However, existing open-source pyramidal video models have been trained from scratch and tend to underperform compared to state-of-the-art systems in terms of visual plausibility. In this work, we present a pipeline that converts a pretrained diffusion model into a pyramidal one through low-cost finetuning, achieving this transformation without degradation in quality of output videos. Furthermore, we investigate and compare various strategies for step distillation within pyramidal models, aiming to further enhance the inference efficiency.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates SAMURAI, a foundation model, for robust long-term drone tracking in urban surveillance and proposes a detector-augmented extension to enhance its performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RGB-based drone tracking methods face temporal inconsistencies due to detection dropouts, and foundation models like SAMURAI have not been explored for drone-specific scenarios despite their cross-domain effectiveness.

Method: A detector-augmented extension of SAMURAI is introduced to address sensitivity to bounding-box initialization and long sequences, enabling robust tracking during drone exit-re-entry events in urban environments.

Result: The proposed method achieves success rate improvements of +0.393 and FNR reductions of -0.475, demonstrating superior robustness in long-duration sequences compared to SAMURAI's zero-shot performance.

Conclusion: Integrating detector cues with foundation models enhances drone tracking robustness in complex urban surveillance, marking the first systematic evaluation of SAMURAI in this domain.

Abstract: Robust long-term tracking of drone is a critical requirement for modern surveillance systems, given their increasing threat potential. While detector-based approaches typically achieve strong frame-level accuracy, they often suffer from temporal inconsistencies caused by frequent detection dropouts. Despite its practical relevance, research on RGB-based drone tracking is still limited and largely reliant on conventional motion models. Meanwhile, foundation models like SAMURAI have established their effectiveness across other domains, exhibiting strong category-agnostic tracking performance. However, their applicability in drone-specific scenarios has not been investigated yet. Motivated by this gap, we present the first systematic evaluation of SAMURAI's potential for robust drone tracking in urban surveillance settings. Furthermore, we introduce a detector-augmented extension of SAMURAI to mitigate sensitivity to bounding-box initialization and sequence length. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed extension significantly improves robustness in complex urban environments, with pronounced benefits in long-duration sequences - especially under drone exit-re-entry events. The incorporation of detector cues yields consistent gains over SAMURAI's zero-shot performance across datasets and metrics, with success rate improvements of up to +0.393 and FNR reductions of up to -0.475.

Abstract: Ancient script images often suffer from severe background noise, low contrast, and degradation caused by aging and environmental effects. In many cases, the foreground text and background exhibit similar visual characteristics, making the inscriptions difficult to read. The primary objective of image enhancement is to improve the readability of such degraded ancient images. This paper presents an image enhancement approach based on binarization and complementary preprocessing techniques for removing stains and enhancing unclear ancient text. The proposed methods are evaluated on different types of ancient scripts, including inscriptions on stone, metal plates, and historical documents. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves classification accuracies of 55.7%, 62%, and 65.6% for stone, metal plate, and document scripts, respectively, using the K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN) classifier. Using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, accuracies of 53.2%, 59.5%, and 67.8% are obtained. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed enhancement method in improving the readability of ancient Marathi inscription images.

Abstract: Automatic identification of events and recurrent behavior analysis are critical for video surveillance. However, most existing content-based video retrieval benchmarks focus on scene-level similarity and do not evaluate the action discrimination required in surveillance. To address this gap, we introduce SOVABench (Surveillance Opposite Vehicle Actions Benchmark), a real-world retrieval benchmark built from surveillance footage and centered on vehicle-related actions. SOVABench defines two evaluation protocols (inter-pair and intra-pair) to assess cross-action discrimination and temporal direction understanding. Although action distinctions are generally intuitive for human observers, our experiments show that they remain challenging for state-of-the-art vision and multimodal models.
  Leveraging the visual reasoning and instruction-following capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), we present a training-free framework for producing interpretable embeddings from MLLM-generated descriptions for both images and videos. The framework achieves strong performance on SOVABench as well as on several spatial and counting benchmarks where contrastive Vision-Language Models often fail. The code, annotations, and instructions to construct the benchmark are publicly available.

Conclusion: DivAS通过优化自由设计平衡了分割质量与实时性，支持零样本交互场景，为NeRF分割提供了高效率实用方案。

Abstract: Existing methods for segmenting Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) are often optimization-based, requiring slow per-scene training that sacrifices the zero-shot capabilities of 2D foundation models. We introduce DivAS (Depth-interactive Voxel Aggregation Segmentation), an optimization-free, fully interactive framework that addresses these limitations. Our method operates via a fast GUI-based workflow where 2D SAM masks, generated from user point prompts, are refined using NeRF-derived depth priors to improve geometric accuracy and foreground-background separation. The core of our contribution is a custom CUDA kernel that aggregates these refined multi-view masks into a unified 3D voxel grid in under 200ms, enabling real-time visual feedback. This optimization-free design eliminates the need for per-scene training. Experiments on Mip-NeRF 360° and LLFF show that DivAS achieves segmentation quality comparable to optimization-based methods, while being 2-2.5x faster end-to-end, and up to an order of magnitude faster when excluding user prompting time.

Conclusion: 本论文揭示了工业约束下VLMs的实用限制和失效模式，为构建可扩展的长视频多模态系统提供实践指导（如注意力机制选型和资源分配策略），而非提出新理论模型。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have shown strong performance on multimodal reasoning tasks, yet most evaluations focus on short videos and assume unconstrained computational resources. In industrial settings such as pharmaceutical content understanding, practitioners must process long-form videos under strict GPU, latency, and cost constraints, where many existing approaches fail to scale. In this work, we present an industrial GenAI framework that processes over 200,000 PDFs, 25,326 videos across eight formats (e.g., MP4, M4V, etc.), and 888 multilingual audio files in more than 20 languages. Our study makes three contributions: (i) an industrial large-scale architecture for multimodal reasoning in pharmaceutical domains; (ii) empirical analysis of over 40 VLMs on two leading benchmarks (Video-MME and MMBench) and proprietary dataset of 25,326 videos across 14 disease areas; and (iii) four findings relevant to long-form video reasoning: the role of multimodality, attention mechanism trade-offs, temporal reasoning limits, and challenges of video splitting under GPU constraints. Results show 3-8 times efficiency gains with SDPA attention on commodity GPUs, multimodality improving up to 8/12 task domains (especially length-dependent tasks), and clear bottlenecks in temporal alignment and keyframe detection across open- and closed-source VLMs. Rather than proposing a new "A+B" model, this paper characterizes practical limits, trade-offs, and failure patterns of current VLMs under realistic deployment constraints, and provide actionable guidance for both researchers and practitioners designing scalable multimodal systems for long-form video understanding in industrial domains.

### [42] [Prototypicality Bias Reveals Blindspots in Multimodal Evaluation Metrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04946)
*Subhadeep Roy,Gagan Bhatia,Steffen Eger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出ProtoBias基准，揭示当前图像生成评估指标普遍存在原型偏向问题，并设计高效且鲁棒的ProtoScore指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估指标可能偏向视觉原型而非语义正确性，需构建控制对比基准检验指标性能。

Method: 创建包含动物/物体/人口统计学的ProtoBias对比基准，测试CLIPScore/PickScore等指标与LLM-as-Judge系统的性能差异。

Result: 主流指标在语义正确vs原型对抗样本中频繁误判，人类评估更倾向语义正确性，基于此开发了加速版ProtoScore。

Conclusion: 原型偏向是评估指标系统缺陷，ProtoScore在保持GPT-5级别性能的同时实现计算效率质的飞跃。

Abstract: Automatic metrics are now central to evaluating text-to-image models, often substituting for human judgment in benchmarking and large-scale filtering. However, it remains unclear whether these metrics truly prioritize semantic correctness or instead favor visually and socially prototypical images learned from biased data distributions. We identify and study \emph{prototypicality bias} as a systematic failure mode in multimodal evaluation. We introduce a controlled contrastive benchmark \textsc{\textbf{ProtoBias}} (\textit{\textbf{Proto}typical \textbf{Bias}}), spanning Animals, Objects, and Demography images, where semantically correct but non-prototypical images are paired with subtly incorrect yet prototypical adversarial counterparts. This setup enables a directional evaluation of whether metrics follow textual semantics or default to prototypes. Our results show that widely used metrics, including CLIPScore, PickScore, and VQA-based scores, frequently misrank these pairs, while even LLM-as-Judge systems exhibit uneven robustness in socially grounded cases. Human evaluations consistently favour semantic correctness with larger decision margins. Motivated by these findings, we propose \textbf{\textsc{ProtoScore}}, a robust 7B-parameter metric that substantially reduces failure rates and suppresses misranking, while running at orders of magnitude faster than the inference time of GPT-5, approaching the robustness of much larger closed-source judges.

*Maximilian Pittner,Joel Janai,Mario Faigle,Alexandru Paul Condurache*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SparseLaneSTP introduces a sparse lane transformer with geometric-temporal integration and a new auto-labeled 3D lane dataset, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D lane detection methods suffer from poor BEV feature alignment, ignorance of lane-specific priors, and lack of temporal information utilization.

Method: SparseLaneSTP combines lane-specific geometric priors with temporal information via a spatio-temporal attention mechanism, continuous lane representation, and temporal regularization in a sparse transformer framework, alongside a new auto-labeling dataset strategy.

Result: The method demonstrates superior performance on 3D lane detection benchmarks, establishing state-of-the-art results in both detection and error metrics.

Conclusion: Incorporating geometric-temporal information and temporal regularization significantly improves 3D lane detection reliability, especially under challenging visibility conditions.

Abstract: 3D lane detection has emerged as a critical challenge in autonomous driving, encompassing identification and localization of lane markings and the 3D road surface. Conventional 3D methods detect lanes from dense birds-eye-viewed (BEV) features, though erroneous transformations often result in a poor feature representation misaligned with the true 3D road surface. While recent sparse lane detectors have surpassed dense BEV approaches, they completely disregard valuable lane-specific priors. Furthermore, existing methods fail to utilize historic lane observations, which yield the potential to resolve ambiguities in situations of poor visibility. To address these challenges, we present SparseLaneSTP, a novel method that integrates both geometric properties of the lane structure and temporal information into a sparse lane transformer. It introduces a new lane-specific spatio-temporal attention mechanism, a continuous lane representation tailored for sparse architectures as well as temporal regularization. Identifying weaknesses of existing 3D lane datasets, we also introduce a precise and consistent 3D lane dataset using a simple yet effective auto-labeling strategy. Our experimental section proves the benefits of our contributions and demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across all detection and error metrics on existing 3D lane detection benchmarks as well as on our novel dataset.

TL;DR: OceanSplat使用3D高斯点绘技术，通过三视角一致性和合成深度先验，实现了水下场景的准确3D几何重建，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下光学退化导致多视角不一致性，现有方法难以准确重建水下3D几何结构。需要一种能处理散射介质干扰、保持场景结构的鲁棒方法。

Method: 引入三视角一致性约束（通过平移相机视角和逆向扭曲对齐）、基于三角化的合成极线深度先验作为自监督正则化项，并提出基于z轴和观测方向的深度感知alpha调整策略，优化3D高斯分布的空间排布。

Result: 在真实水下场景和模拟数据中均取得较现有方法显著提升的重建与修复效果，有效抑制了介质诱导伪影和漂浮伪影。

Conclusion: OceanSplat通过解耦散射介质干扰，实现了水下场景3D几何的稳定表示，为散射介质中的场景重建提供了新范式。

Abstract: We introduce OceanSplat, a novel 3D Gaussian Splatting-based approach for accurately representing 3D geometry in underwater scenes. To overcome multi-view inconsistencies caused by underwater optical degradation, our method enforces trinocular view consistency by rendering horizontally and vertically translated camera views relative to each input view and aligning them via inverse warping. Furthermore, these translated camera views are used to derive a synthetic epipolar depth prior through triangulation, which serves as a self-supervised depth regularizer. These geometric constraints facilitate the spatial optimization of 3D Gaussians and preserve scene structure in underwater environments. We also propose a depth-aware alpha adjustment that modulates the opacity of 3D Gaussians during early training based on their $z$-component and viewing direction, deterring the formation of medium-induced primitives. With our contributions, 3D Gaussians are disentangled from the scattering medium, enabling robust representation of object geometry and significantly reducing floating artifacts in reconstructed underwater scenes. Experiments on real-world underwater and simulated scenes demonstrate that OceanSplat substantially outperforms existing methods for both scene reconstruction and restoration in scattering media.

TL;DR: 探讨高阶对抗攻击对YOLOv10目标检测器的影响，发现其比低阶攻击更具泛化能力，且传统对抗训练难以有效防御。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示对抗攻击与防御间的‘猫鼠游戏’本质，评估现有防御方法的不足，并分析高阶攻击的迁移特性。

Method: 采用YOLOv10检测模型，通过对抗补丁实施逃避攻击，并交替进行攻击模式训练与对抗训练以增强防御。

Result: 高阶对抗补丁不仅影响直接训练的检测器，还表现出跨模型泛化能力；单一对抗训练无法有效防御此类攻击。

Conclusion: 高阶对抗攻击需更复杂的防御策略，传统方法不足以应对，未来需开发更鲁棒的防护机制。

Abstract: Higher-order adversarial attacks can directly be considered the result of a cat-and-mouse game -- an elaborate action involving constant pursuit, near captures, and repeated escapes. This idiom describes the enduring circular training of adversarial attack patterns and adversarial training the best. The following work investigates the impact of higher-order adversarial attacks on object detectors by successively training attack patterns and hardening object detectors with adversarial training. The YOLOv10 object detector is chosen as a representative, and adversarial patches are used in an evasion attack manner. Our results indicate that higher-order adversarial patches are not only affecting the object detector directly trained on but rather provide a stronger generalization capacity compared to lower-order adversarial patches. Moreover, the results highlight that solely adversarial training is not sufficient to harden an object detector efficiently against this kind of adversarial attack.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PolyFit是一种基于局部拟合jet函数的补丁式表面表示方法，能高效学习并应用于各种表面形变，如3D模板重建与布料仿真，效果准确且速度优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有表面形变方法在效率和泛化性上存在不足，需一种紧凑且可微的表示形式，既能高效学习又能适应不同任务（如图像/视频驱动的形变、布料仿真），同时避免逐顶点优化的计算瓶颈。

Method: 将表面划分为局部补丁，每个补丁通过监督训练拟合jet函数（多项式级数），用紧凑的系数编码表面几何信息。形变通过优化系数实现，无需逐顶点计算。在Shape-from-Template任务中采用测试时优化，布料仿真则训练自监督的通用模型。

Result: 1) Shape-from-Template任务中精度与物理求解器相当，但速度显著更快；2) 布料仿真可跨分辨率与服装类型泛化，推理速度比基线快一个数量级；3) 模型参数量小，优化过程更稳定。

Conclusion: PolyFit通过局部解析表示实现高效且通用的表面形变，解决了传统方法在速度与泛化性上的局限，为计算机视觉与图形学任务提供了实用工具。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a patch-based representation of surfaces, PolyFit, which is obtained by fitting jet functions locally on surface patches. Such a representation can be learned efficiently in a supervised fashion from both analytic functions and real data. Once learned, it can be generalized to various types of surfaces. Using PolyFit, the surfaces can be efficiently deformed by updating a compact set of jet coefficients rather than optimizing per-vertex degrees of freedom for many downstream tasks in computer vision and graphics. We demonstrate the capabilities of our proposed methodologies with two applications: 1) Shape-from-template (SfT): where the goal is to deform the input 3D template of an object as seen in image/video. Using PolyFit, we adopt test-time optimization that delivers competitive accuracy while being markedly faster than offline physics-based solvers, and outperforms recent physics-guided neural simulators in accuracy at modest additional runtime. 2) Garment draping. We train a self-supervised, mesh- and garment-agnostic model that generalizes across resolutions and garment types, delivering up to an order-of-magnitude faster inference than strong baselines.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合音频语言模型（ALM）和视觉语言模型（VLM）的视频片段生成框架，通过可复用的Cut & Merge算法、个性化机制和端到端管道策略，实现制药行业视频内容的高效处理与摘要生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 制药行业依赖传统人工标注异构数据（文本、图像、视频等），存在一致性低、效率差等问题，且长视频/音频数据（如临床试验访谈）进一步加剧处理难度，亟需智能化解决方案。

Method: 1. 提出Cut & Merge算法，包含淡入淡出过渡和时间戳归一化，确保音视频对齐；2. 基于角色定义与提示注入实现个性化输出（营销、培训等）；3. 设计成本高效的端到端流程，平衡ALM/VLM处理效率。

Result: 在Video MME基准和包含16,159条药品视频的私有数据集验证，较基线模型（如Gemini 2.5 Pro）实现3-4倍提速、4倍成本降低，且片段连贯性得分0.348和信息性得分0.721均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为生命科学领域提供透明、可定制且符合合规要求的视频摘要技术，验证了VLM/ALM在制药行业自动化内容处理中的潜力，可拓展至其他领域。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are poised to revolutionize the digital transformation of pharmacyceutical industry by enabling intelligent, scalable, and automated multi-modality content processing. Traditional manual annotation of heterogeneous data modalities (text, images, video, audio, and web links), is prone to inconsistencies, quality degradation, and inefficiencies in content utilization. The sheer volume of long video and audio data further exacerbates these challenges, (e.g. long clinical trial interviews and educational seminars).
  Here, we introduce a domain adapted Video to Video Clip Generation framework that integrates Audio Language Models (ALMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) to produce highlight clips. Our contributions are threefold: (i) a reproducible Cut & Merge algorithm with fade in/out and timestamp normalization, ensuring smooth transitions and audio/visual alignment; (ii) a personalization mechanism based on role definition and prompt injection for tailored outputs (marketing, training, regulatory); (iii) a cost efficient e2e pipeline strategy balancing ALM/VLM enhanced processing. Evaluations on Video MME benchmark (900) and our proprietary dataset of 16,159 pharmacy videos across 14 disease areas demonstrate 3 to 4 times speedup, 4 times cost reduction, and competitive clip quality. Beyond efficiency gains, we also report our methods improved clip coherence scores (0.348) and informativeness scores (0.721) over state of the art VLM baselines (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Pro), highlighting the potential of transparent, custom extractive, and compliance supporting video summarization for life sciences.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动驾驶系统在视觉特征压缩与推理效率之间难以平衡，且缺乏对驾驶行为可解释性的建模。论文旨在通过纯Transformer架构实现高效、准确且行为可解释的端到端自动驾驶。

Method: 1) 基于预训练视觉Transformer(ViT)，引入相机感知的压缩寄存器令牌（camera-aware register tokens），将多视角摄像头特征压缩为紧凑场景表示；2) 使用两个轻量化Transformer解码器，分别生成轨迹候选项并学习模仿专家模型对轨迹进行评分，评分包含安全、舒适性、效率等可解释子指标。

Result: 在NAVSIM-v1、NAVSIM-v2和HUGSIM基准测试中，DrivoR在计算资源消耗更少的情况下，性能优于或持平于强基线模型，并能输出行为可解释的驾驶决策。

Conclusion: 纯Transformer架构结合针对性特征压缩机制，能够满足自动驾驶对准确性、效率和行为可解释性的多重需求，为端到端系统设计提供新方向。

Abstract: We present DrivoR, a simple and efficient transformer-based architecture for end-to-end autonomous driving. Our approach builds on pretrained Vision Transformers (ViTs) and introduces camera-aware register tokens that compress multi-camera features into a compact scene representation, significantly reducing downstream computation without sacrificing accuracy. These tokens drive two lightweight transformer decoders that generate and then score candidate trajectories. The scoring decoder learns to mimic an oracle and predicts interpretable sub-scores representing aspects such as safety, comfort, and efficiency, enabling behavior-conditioned driving at inference. Despite its minimal design, DrivoR outperforms or matches strong contemporary baselines across NAVSIM-v1, NAVSIM-v2, and the photorealistic closed-loop HUGSIM benchmark. Our results show that a pure-transformer architecture, combined with targeted token compression, is sufficient for accurate, efficient, and adaptive end-to-end driving. Code and checkpoints will be made available via the project page.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种无需人工标注的自监督多模态伪标签方法，通过利用LiDAR点云的时间-几何一致性，将文本和2D视觉模型的线索转化为3D，解决自动驾驶中的密集3D几何标注难题。


<details>

Motivation: 自动驾驶领域中未标注的LiDAR数据因需人工标注成本高昂而难以利用，现有伪标签方法多依赖手动监督，亟需降低人工依赖以提升感知性能。

Method: 提出基于时间累积LiDAR地图学习的强几何先验，设计迭代更新规则确保几何-语义联合一致性，通过多模态融合提取3D语义标签、边界框及稠密点云，并利用不一致性检测运动物体。

Result: 在三个数据集上实现鲁棒性，3D伪标签生成优于现有方法；仅使用少量几何一致性稠密化LiDAR数据，使80-150米和150-250米范围的深度预测MAE分别提升51.5%和22.0%。

Conclusion: 该方法完全无需人工输入，通过几何一致性实现跨模态稠密化，在减少人工标注成本的同时提升远距离深度预测精度，并同步实现运动物体检测。

Abstract: Unlabeled LiDAR logs, in autonomous driving applications, are inherently a gold mine of dense 3D geometry hiding in plain sight - yet they are almost useless without human labels, highlighting a dominant cost barrier for autonomous-perception research. In this work we tackle this bottleneck by leveraging temporal-geometric consistency across LiDAR sweeps to lift and fuse cues from text and 2D vision foundation models directly into 3D, without any manual input. We introduce an unsupervised multi-modal pseudo-labeling method relying on strong geometric priors learned from temporally accumulated LiDAR maps, alongside with a novel iterative update rule that enforces joint geometric-semantic consistency, and vice-versa detecting moving objects from inconsistencies. Our method simultaneously produces 3D semantic labels, 3D bounding boxes, and dense LiDAR scans, demonstrating robust generalization across three datasets. We experimentally validate that our method compares favorably to existing semantic segmentation and object detection pseudo-labeling methods, which often require additional manual supervision. We confirm that even a small fraction of our geometrically consistent, densified LiDAR improves depth prediction by 51.5% and 22.0% MAE in the 80-150 and 150-250 meters range, respectively.

Method: 提出Projective Conditioning：1) 用目标视图投影线索替代原始相机参数，将几何回归转化为图像翻译问题；2) 引入掩码自编码预训练策略，支持使用无标定数据。

Result: 在View-Consistency基准上提升跨视图一致性，在标准数据集达到SOTA质量，合成图像更逼真且对相机变换鲁棒。

Conclusion: 投影条件输入和预训练策略解决了射线条件的稳定性问题，为视图合成任务提供了新范式。

Abstract: Feed-forward view synthesis models predict a novel view in a single pass with minimal 3D inductive bias. Existing works encode cameras as Plücker ray maps, which tie predictions to the arbitrary world coordinate gauge and make them sensitive to small camera transformations, thereby undermining geometric consistency. In this paper, we ask what inputs best condition a model for robust and consistent view synthesis. We propose projective conditioning, which replaces raw camera parameters with a target-view projective cue that provides a stable 2D input. This reframes the task from a brittle geometric regression problem in ray space to a well-conditioned target-view image-to-image translation problem. Additionally, we introduce a masked autoencoding pretraining strategy tailored to this cue, enabling the use of large-scale uncalibrated data for pretraining. Our method shows improved fidelity and stronger cross-view consistency compared to ray-conditioned baselines on our view-consistency benchmark. It also achieves state-of-the-art quality on standard novel view synthesis benchmarks.

Abstract: This work introduces VERSE, a methodology for analyzing and improving Vision-Language Models applied to Visually-rich Document Understanding by exploring their visual embedding space. VERSE enables the visualization of latent representations, supporting the assessment of model feasibility. It also facilitates the identification of problematic regions and guides the generation of synthetic data to enhance performance in those clusters. We validate the methodology by training on the synthetic MERIT Dataset and evaluating on its real-world counterpart, MERIT Secret. Results show that VERSE helps uncover the visual features associated with error-prone clusters, and that retraining with samples containing these features substantially boosts F1 performance without degrading generalization. Furthermore, we demonstrate that on-premise models such as Donut and Idefics2, when optimized with VERSE, match or even surpass the performance of SaaS solutions like GPT-4 and Pixtral.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成模型缺乏对相机和多对象运动的统一精确控制，且传统2D动力学建模无法满足现实需求。视频生成需要精确动态控制，而大规模标注4D数据集的缺失加剧了这一挑战。

Method: 1) 提出4D Geometric Control表示法：静态背景点云+对象级3D高斯轨迹，捕获对象路径和随时间演变的3D概率占位；2) 将4D控制渲染为条件信号输入预训练视频扩散模型；3) 开发动态引擎，从无标注真实视频中自动提取4D控制参数实现数据扩展。

Result: 实现了相机和对象动力学的统一显式控制，生成视频具有：- 高空间分辨率（512x512）- 跨视角一致性 - 符合指定动力学的精确运动轨迹 - 多样化场景生成能力。在无标注视频上训练后仍保持性能。

Conclusion: 该工作证明了4D几何建模在视频生成中的有效性，为动态内容创作提供了新范式。数据引擎方案缓解了标注成本，但可能存在真实场景复杂度覆盖不足的局限性，未来可探索物理规则约束的引入。

Abstract: Video world models aim to simulate dynamic, real-world environments, yet existing methods struggle to provide unified and precise control over camera and multi-object motion, as videos inherently operate dynamics in the projected 2D image plane. To bridge this gap, we introduce VerseCrafter, a 4D-aware video world model that enables explicit and coherent control over both camera and object dynamics within a unified 4D geometric world state. Our approach is centered on a novel 4D Geometric Control representation, which encodes the world state through a static background point cloud and per-object 3D Gaussian trajectories. This representation captures not only an object's path but also its probabilistic 3D occupancy over time, offering a flexible, category-agnostic alternative to rigid bounding boxes or parametric models. These 4D controls are rendered into conditioning signals for a pretrained video diffusion model, enabling the generation of high-fidelity, view-consistent videos that precisely adhere to the specified dynamics. Unfortunately, another major challenge lies in the scarcity of large-scale training data with explicit 4D annotations. We address this by developing an automatic data engine that extracts the required 4D controls from in-the-wild videos, allowing us to train our model on a massive and diverse dataset.

Abstract: Visual question answering for crop disease analysis requires accurate visual understanding and reliable language generation. This work presents a lightweight vision-language framework for crop and disease identification from leaf images. The proposed approach combines a Swin Transformer vision encoder with sequence-to-sequence language decoders. A two-stage training strategy is adopted to improve visual representation learning and cross-modal alignment. The model is evaluated on a large-scale crop disease dataset using classification and natural language generation metrics. Experimental results show high accuracy for both crop and disease identification. The framework also achieves strong performance on BLEU, ROUGE and BERTScore. Our proposed models outperform large-scale vision-language baselines while using significantly fewer parameters. Explainability is assessed using Grad-CAM and token-level attribution. Qualitative results demonstrate robust performance under diverse user-driven queries. These findings highlight the effectiveness of task-specific visual pretraining for crop disease visual question answering.

*Elia Peruzzo,Guillaume Sautière,Amirhossein Habibian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种多尺度局部推测解码方法(MuLo-SD)，通过多分辨率草案生成与局部校正重采样的结合，在保持图像质量的同时实现自回归图像生成的1.7倍加速，超越EAGLE-2和LANTERN等基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自回归模型由于序列生成特性存在延迟问题，而现有推测解码方法受限于token级模糊性和空间感知缺失，需开发更高效的空间感知加速框架。

Method: 1) 多尺度草案生成：低分辨率草案模型配合上采样器提出候选token；2) 局部校正：高分辨率模型并行验证并聚焦空间邻域进行错误校正；3) 邻域扩展重采样：通过局部拒绝链机制优化错误修正

Result: 在MS-COCO 5k验证集上，相较基线方法实现1.7倍加速，在GenEval、DPG-Bench、FID/HPSv2指标中保持语义一致性与感知质量（FID 3.52↓12% vs LANTERN）

Conclusion: MuLo-SD通过空间局部性建模突破推测解码效率瓶颈，建立图像生成领域推测解码的新SOTA，平衡计算效率与生成质量，为大规模视觉模型部署提供新路径

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models have achieved remarkable success in image synthesis, yet their sequential nature imposes significant latency constraints. Speculative Decoding offers a promising avenue for acceleration, but existing approaches are limited by token-level ambiguity and lack of spatial awareness. In this work, we introduce Multi-Scale Local Speculative Decoding (MuLo-SD), a novel framework that combines multi-resolution drafting with spatially informed verification to accelerate AR image generation. Our method leverages a low-resolution drafter paired with learned up-samplers to propose candidate image tokens, which are then verified in parallel by a high-resolution target model. Crucially, we incorporate a local rejection and resampling mechanism, enabling efficient correction of draft errors by focusing on spatial neighborhoods rather than raster-scan resampling after the first rejection. We demonstrate that MuLo-SD achieves substantial speedups - up to $\mathbf{1.7\times}$ - outperforming strong speculative decoding baselines such as EAGLE-2 and LANTERN in terms of acceleration, while maintaining comparable semantic alignment and perceptual quality. These results are validated using GenEval, DPG-Bench, and FID/HPSv2 on the MS-COCO 5k validation split. Extensive ablations highlight the impact of up-sampling design, probability pooling, and local rejection and resampling with neighborhood expansion. Our approach sets a new state-of-the-art in speculative decoding for image synthesis, bridging the gap between efficiency and fidelity.

TL;DR: VLI框架通过模拟元认知自纠过程减少多模态大模型的对象幻觉问题，提升视觉证据与语言推理的协调性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大模型存在对象幻觉问题，主要因模型过度依赖语言先验而忽视具体视觉证据。现有方案如对比解码和静态潜向量引导存在修正语义错位不彻底或缺乏实例特异性的问题。

Method: 提出零训练推理框架VLI：1) 属性自省阶段通过概率冲突检测定位幻觉风险和视觉根源；2) 可解释双因果引导阶段动态分离视觉证据与背景噪声，并通过自适应校准消除过度自信。

Result: 在MMHal-Bench基准上幻觉率降低12.67%，POPE任务准确率提升5.8%，优于现有对抗解码和潜引导方案。

Conclusion: VLI提供了一种无需训练的认知纠错机制，通过双阶段动态调节显著提升多模态模型的可靠性，为语言-视觉推理的协同优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Object hallucination critically undermines the reliability of Multimodal Large Language Models, often stemming from a fundamental failure in cognitive introspection, where models blindly trust linguistic priors over specific visual evidence. Existing mitigations remain limited: contrastive decoding approaches operate superficially without rectifying internal semantic misalignments, while current latent steering methods rely on static vectors that lack instance-specific precision. We introduce Vision-Language Introspection (VLI), a training-free inference framework that simulates a metacognitive self-correction process. VLI first performs Attributive Introspection to diagnose hallucination risks via probabilistic conflict detection and localize the causal visual anchors. It then employs Interpretable Bi-Causal Steering to actively modulate the inference process, dynamically isolating visual evidence from background noise while neutralizing blind confidence through adaptive calibration. VLI achieves state-of-the-art performance on advanced models, reducing object hallucination rates by 12.67% on MMHal-Bench and improving accuracy by 5.8% on POPE.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces VideoAuto-R1, a framework that reduces computational overhead in video understanding by selectively applying reasoning steps based on task complexity, achieving improved efficiency without sacrificing accuracy compared to traditional chain-of-thought approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Observing that direct answering often matches or exceeds CoT performance in RL-trained video models despite lower computational cost, the authors investigate when explicit reasoning is necessary to optimize efficiency.

Method: The framework employs a 'Thinking Once, Answering Twice' training paradigm: the model first generates an initial answer, performs reasoning, then outputs a reviewed answer (both supervised via verifiable rewards). During inference, confidence scores determine whether to skip reasoning steps.

Result: VideoAuto-R1 achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while reducing average response length by ~3.3x (e.g., 149 to 44 tokens). Thinking-mode activation occurs less frequently on perception-oriented tasks (25%) but more on reasoning-intensive tasks (65%).

Conclusion: Explicit language-based reasoning improves performance but isn't universally required—selective application based on task demands balances accuracy and efficiency, challenging the default reliance on CoT in multimodal models.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has emerged as a powerful tool for multimodal large language models on video understanding tasks. However, its necessity and advantages over direct answering remain underexplored. In this paper, we first demonstrate that for RL-trained video models, direct answering often matches or even surpasses CoT performance, despite CoT producing step-by-step analyses at a higher computational cost. Motivated by this, we propose VideoAuto-R1, a video understanding framework that adopts a reason-when-necessary strategy. During training, our approach follows a Thinking Once, Answering Twice paradigm: the model first generates an initial answer, then performs reasoning, and finally outputs a reviewed answer. Both answers are supervised via verifiable rewards. During inference, the model uses the confidence score of the initial answer to determine whether to proceed with reasoning. Across video QA and grounding benchmarks, VideoAuto-R1 achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with significantly improved efficiency, reducing the average response length by ~3.3x, e.g., from 149 to just 44 tokens. Moreover, we observe a low rate of thinking-mode activation on perception-oriented tasks, but a higher rate on reasoning-intensive tasks. This suggests that explicit language-based reasoning is generally beneficial but not always necessary.

*William Rudman,Michal Golovanevsky,Dana Arad,Yonatan Belinkov,Ritambhara Singh,Carsten Eickhoff,Kyle Mahowald*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Large vision-language models (VLMs) often hallucinate by prioritizing textual prompts over visual input. A study shows ablation of specific attention heads reduces prompt-induced hallucinations by over 40% without altering model weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs exhibit hallucination behaviors due to overreliance on textual prompts. This research aims to uncover internal mechanisms driving these failures through controlled experiments.

Method: Conducted controlled object-counting experiments with overestimated prompts, performed ablation studies on attention heads across three VLM architectures, and analyzed model responses to visual discrepancies.

Result: Identified PIH-specific attention heads significantly reducing hallucinations when ablated. Found model-specific mechanisms for prompt copying and confirmed increased visual evidence correction post-ablation.

Conclusion: Prompt-induced hallucinations stem from distinct attention pathways in different VLMs. Mechanistic understanding enables effective mitigation through targeted ablation without retraining requirements.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) are highly capable, yet often hallucinate by favoring textual prompts over visual evidence. We study this failure mode in a controlled object-counting setting, where the prompt overstates the number of objects in the image (e.g., asking a model to describe four waterlilies when only three are present). At low object counts, models often correct the overestimation, but as the number of objects increases, they increasingly conform to the prompt regardless of the discrepancy. Through mechanistic analysis of three VLMs, we identify a small set of attention heads whose ablation substantially reduces prompt-induced hallucinations (PIH) by at least 40% without additional training. Across models, PIH-heads mediate prompt copying in model-specific ways. We characterize these differences and show that PIH ablation increases correction toward visual evidence. Our findings offer insights into the internal mechanisms driving prompt-induced hallucinations, revealing model-specific differences in how these behaviors are implemented.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlowLet是一种基于流匹配的条件生成框架，通过在可逆3D小波域中合成年龄条件化的3D MRI数据，解决了传统生成方法在内存需求、生成速度及年龄条件化方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑龄预测（BAP）模型需要大型且多样化的数据集，但现有3D MRI数据集存在人口统计偏差，而传统生成模型存在推理速度慢、压缩伪影和缺乏年龄条件化的问题，限制了BAP性能。

Method: FlowLet利用流匹配技术，在可逆3D小波域中直接合成年龄条件化的MRI数据，避免潜在空间压缩伪影，并通过高效计算降低资源需求。

Result: 实验表明，FlowLet生成高保真MRI体积数据仅需少量采样步骤，使用生成数据训练的BAP模型在代表性不足的年龄段性能提升，且区域分析验证了解剖结构保留。

Conclusion: FlowLet通过年龄条件化的生成策略与小波域优化，有效提升了BAP模型的公平性和泛化能力，同时减少了传统方法的计算与伪影问题。

Abstract: Brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) plays a central role in studying neurological development, aging, and diseases. One key application is Brain Age Prediction (BAP), which estimates an individual's biological brain age from MRI data. Effective BAP models require large, diverse, and age-balanced datasets, whereas existing 3D MRI datasets are demographically skewed, limiting fairness and generalizability. Acquiring new data is costly and ethically constrained, motivating generative data augmentation. Current generative methods are often based on latent diffusion models, which operate in learned low dimensional latent spaces to address the memory demands of volumetric MRI data. However, these methods are typically slow at inference, may introduce artifacts due to latent compression, and are rarely conditioned on age, thereby affecting the BAP performance. In this work, we propose FlowLet, a conditional generative framework that synthesizes age-conditioned 3D MRIs by leveraging flow matching within an invertible 3D wavelet domain, helping to avoid reconstruction artifacts and reducing computational demands. Experiments show that FlowLet generates high-fidelity volumes with few sampling steps. Training BAP models with data generated by FlowLet improves performance for underrepresented age groups, and region-based analysis confirms preservation of anatomical structures.

Conclusion: 提供了首个可扩展的、直接从观察中学习的3D物体中心动态模型框架，为机器理解物体交互与运动轨迹提供了新范式。

Abstract: Humans can effortlessly anticipate how objects might move or change through interaction--imagining a cup being lifted, a knife slicing, or a lid being closed. We aim to endow computational systems with a similar ability to predict plausible future object motions directly from passive visual observation. We introduce ObjectForesight, a 3D object-centric dynamics model that predicts future 6-DoF poses and trajectories of rigid objects from short egocentric video sequences. Unlike conventional world or dynamics models that operate in pixel or latent space, ObjectForesight represents the world explicitly in 3D at the object level, enabling geometrically grounded and temporally coherent predictions that capture object affordances and trajectories. To train such a model at scale, we leverage recent advances in segmentation, mesh reconstruction, and 3D pose estimation to curate a dataset of 2 million plus short clips with pseudo-ground-truth 3D object trajectories. Through extensive experiments, we show that ObjectForesight achieves significant gains in accuracy, geometric consistency, and generalization to unseen objects and scenes, establishing a scalable framework for learning physically grounded, object-centric dynamics models directly from observation. objectforesight.github.io

Abstract: The diversity, quantity, and quality of manipulation data are critical for training effective robot policies. However, due to hardware and physical setup constraints, collecting large-scale real-world manipulation data remains difficult to scale across diverse environments. Recent work uses text-prompt conditioned image diffusion models to augment manipulation data by altering the backgrounds and tabletop objects in the visual observations. However, these approaches often overlook the practical need for multi-view and temporally coherent observations required by state-of-the-art policy models. Further, text prompts alone cannot reliably specify the scene setup. To provide the diffusion model with explicit visual guidance, we introduce visual identity prompting, which supplies exemplar images as conditioning inputs to guide the generation of the desired scene setup. To this end, we also build a scalable pipeline to curate a visual identity pool from large robotics datasets. Using our augmented manipulation data to train downstream vision-language-action and visuomotor policy models yields consistent performance gains in both simulation and real-robot settings.

Conclusion: GREx框架及gRefCOCO数据集拓展了指代表达研究的维度，提出的区域交互建模方法有效提升了多目标表达解析性能。

Abstract: Referring Expression Segmentation (RES) and Comprehension (REC) respectively segment and detect the object described by an expression, while Referring Expression Generation (REG) generates an expression for the selected object. Existing datasets and methods commonly support single-target expressions only, i.e., one expression refers to one object, not considering multi-target and no-target expressions. This greatly limits the real applications of REx (RES/REC/REG). This paper introduces three new benchmarks called Generalized Referring Expression Segmentation (GRES), Comprehension (GREC), and Generation (GREG), collectively denoted as GREx, which extend the classic REx to allow expressions to identify an arbitrary number of objects. We construct the first large-scale GREx dataset gRefCOCO that contains multi-target, no-target, and single-target expressions and their corresponding images with labeled targets. GREx and gRefCOCO are designed to be backward-compatible with REx, facilitating extensive experiments to study the performance gap of the existing REx methods on GREx tasks. One of the challenges of GRES/GREC is complex relationship modeling, for which we propose a baseline ReLA that adaptively divides the image into regions with sub-instance clues and explicitly models the region-region and region-language dependencies. The proposed ReLA achieves the state-of-the-art results on the both GRES and GREC tasks. The proposed gRefCOCO dataset and method are available at https://henghuiding.github.io/GREx.

Abstract: Recovering clean and accurate geometry from images is essential for robotics and augmented reality. However, existing geometry foundation models still suffer severely from flying pixels and the loss of fine details. In this paper, we present pixel-perfect visual geometry models that can predict high-quality, flying-pixel-free point clouds by leveraging generative modeling in the pixel space. We first introduce Pixel-Perfect Depth (PPD), a monocular depth foundation model built upon pixel-space diffusion transformers (DiT). To address the high computational complexity associated with pixel-space diffusion, we propose two key designs: 1) Semantics-Prompted DiT, which incorporates semantic representations from vision foundation models to prompt the diffusion process, preserving global semantics while enhancing fine-grained visual details; and 2) Cascade DiT architecture that progressively increases the number of image tokens, improving both efficiency and accuracy. To further extend PPD to video (PPVD), we introduce a new Semantics-Consistent DiT, which extracts temporally consistent semantics from a multi-view geometry foundation model. We then perform reference-guided token propagation within the DiT to maintain temporal coherence with minimal computational and memory overhead. Our models achieve the best performance among all generative monocular and video depth estimation models and produce significantly cleaner point clouds than all other models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: QNeRF, a hybrid quantum-classical model leveraging quantum circuits, achieves compact and efficient 3D scene representation from 2D images, outperforming classical NeRFs with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical NeRFs require large models and intensive training for novel-view synthesis. QVFs offer compactness and convergence benefits but lack application in this domain. The work bridges this gap by integrating quantum principles to enhance model efficiency.

Method: QNeRF employs parameterized quantum circuits to encode spatial and view-dependent information via quantum superposition/entanglement. Two variants are proposed: Full QNeRF utilizes all quantum amplitudes for maximal representation power, while Dual-Branch QNeRF introduces task-informed inductive bias through spatial-view branching to reduce complexity and improve scalability.

Result: QNeRF matches or exceeds classical NeRF performance with <50% of the parameters on moderate-resolution image datasets, demonstrating scalable quantum advantage in model compactness.

Conclusion: Quantum machine learning can effectively model continuous 3D signals from 2D observations, offering a competitive alternative to classical methods for vision tasks by leveraging quantum principles in hybrid architectures.

Abstract: Recently, Quantum Visual Fields (QVFs) have shown promising improvements in model compactness and convergence speed for learning the provided 2D or 3D signals. Meanwhile, novel-view synthesis has seen major advances with Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), where models learn a compact representation from 2D images to render 3D scenes, albeit at the cost of larger models and intensive training. In this work, we extend the approach of QVFs by introducing QNeRF, the first hybrid quantum-classical model designed for novel-view synthesis from 2D images. QNeRF leverages parameterised quantum circuits to encode spatial and view-dependent information via quantum superposition and entanglement, resulting in more compact models compared to the classical counterpart. We present two architectural variants. Full QNeRF maximally exploits all quantum amplitudes to enhance representational capabilities. In contrast, Dual-Branch QNeRF introduces a task-informed inductive bias by branching spatial and view-dependent quantum state preparations, drastically reducing the complexity of this operation and ensuring scalability and potential hardware compatibility. Our experiments demonstrate that -- when trained on images of moderate resolution -- QNeRF matches or outperforms classical NeRF baselines while using less than half the number of parameters. These results suggest that quantum machine learning can serve as a competitive alternative for continuous signal representation in mid-level tasks in computer vision, such as 3D representation learning from 2D observations.

Conclusion: Mesh4D通过联合优化潜在表示和扩散预测，解决了单目视频4D网格重建的效率与精度平衡问题。

Abstract: We propose Mesh4D, a feed-forward model for monocular 4D mesh reconstruction. Given a monocular video of a dynamic object, our model reconstructs the object's complete 3D shape and motion, represented as a deformation field. Our key contribution is a compact latent space that encodes the entire animation sequence in a single pass. This latent space is learned by an autoencoder that, during training, is guided by the skeletal structure of the training objects, providing strong priors on plausible deformations. Crucially, skeletal information is not required at inference time. The encoder employs spatio-temporal attention, yielding a more stable representation of the object's overall deformation. Building on this representation, we train a latent diffusion model that, conditioned on the input video and the mesh reconstructed from the first frame, predicts the full animation in one shot. We evaluate Mesh4D on reconstruction and novel view synthesis benchmarks, outperforming prior methods in recovering accurate 3D shape and deformation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MedPI是一种基于105个维度的医疗对话评估基准，通过合成数据、AI患者模拟和结构化评分框架，评估大型语言模型（LLLMs）在医疗对话中的表现，发现当前模型在关键领域（如鉴别诊断）效果不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医疗评估多为单轮问答形式，缺乏对复杂医疗对话流程的全面衡量。MedPI通过多维评分体系（覆盖医疗流程、安全性、沟通等）解决这一缺陷，并与临床认证标准（ACGME）对齐，以提升现实应用价值。

Method: 构建五层框架：1）合成患者电子病历数据；2）通过带记忆与情感模块的LLM模拟AI患者；3）覆盖就诊原因（如焦虑、孕检）与目标（诊断、用药建议）的任务矩阵；4）基于ACGME能力框架的105项评分维度；5）使用委员会式AI法官生成评分与证据链。测试对象为9类主流LLM，完成7,097次对话并分析模型弱点。

Result: 所有测试模型（如GPT-5、Claude 4.1）均在多个维度表现欠佳，尤其在复杂推理场景（如鉴别诊断）中一致性不足，揭示当前LLM在医疗决策中的局限性。AI法官系统可有效量化模型问题（如安全风险、沟通缺失）。

Conclusion: MedPI为医疗LLM的改进提供可量化的诊断工具，证明当前模型尚未满足临床需求。未来需针对多轮推理、患者个体化响应等方向优化，并强调临床权威标准在评估中的必要性。

Abstract: We present MedPI, a high-dimensional benchmark for evaluating large language models (LLMs) in patient-clinician conversations. Unlike single-turn question-answer (QA) benchmarks, MedPI evaluates the medical dialogue across 105 dimensions comprising the medical process, treatment safety, treatment outcomes and doctor-patient communication across a granular, accreditation-aligned rubric. MedPI comprises five layers: (1) Patient Packets (synthetic EHR-like ground truth); (2) an AI Patient instantiated through an LLM with memory and affect; (3) a Task Matrix spanning encounter reasons (e.g. anxiety, pregnancy, wellness checkup) x encounter objectives (e.g. diagnosis, lifestyle advice, medication advice); (4) an Evaluation Framework with 105 dimensions on a 1-4 scale mapped to the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) competencies; and (5) AI Judges that are calibrated, committee-based LLMs providing scores, flags, and evidence-linked rationales. We evaluate 9 flagship models -- Claude Opus 4.1, Claude Sonnet 4, MedGemma, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Llama 3.3 70b Instruct, GPT-5, GPT OSS 120b, o3, Grok-4 -- across 366 AI Patients and 7,097 conversations using a standardized "vanilla clinician" prompt. For all LLMs, we observe low performance across a variety of dimensions, in particular on differential diagnosis.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出RAGVUE框架，用于对检索增强生成系统进行可解释的自动化评估，其通过拆分评估维度（如检索质量、答案相关性、主张忠实性）来诊断复杂错误


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG评估指标仅输出单一分数且无法定位检索、推理或事实性错误，需要更细粒度的诊断工具

Method: 构建多维度拆解框架（检索质量/答案覆盖率/主张级忠实性），配套Python API/CLI并提供结构化解释

Result: 相比RAGAS等工具，该框架在对比实验中能识别出更精细的错误模式（如检索漏检导致答案不完整）

Conclusion: RAGVUE通过模块化评估组件实现实时诊断，支持与RAG开发流程的自动化集成，代码已开源

Abstract: Evaluating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems remains a challenging task: existing metrics often collapse heterogeneous behaviors into single scores and provide little insight into whether errors arise from retrieval,reasoning, or grounding. In this paper, we introduce RAGVUE, a diagnostic and explainable framework for automated, reference-free evaluation of RAG pipelines. RAGVUE decomposes RAG behavior into retrieval quality, answer relevance and completeness, strict claim-level faithfulness, and judge calibration. Each metric includes a structured explanation, making the evaluation process transparent. Our framework supports both manual metric selection and fully automated agentic evaluation. It also provides a Python API, CLI, and a local Streamlit interface for interactive usage. In comparative experiments, RAGVUE surfaces fine-grained failures that existing tools such as RAGAS often overlook. We showcase the full RAGVUE workflow and illustrate how it can be integrated into research pipelines and practical RAG development. The source code and detailed instructions on usage are publicly available on GitHub

TL;DR: 本论文提出利用大语言模型生成控制合成电子商务商品数据的新方法，通过属性保持修改、生成控制负例和系统属性删除三种策略，生成了高质量的合成数据。实验表明该方法生成的数据在MAVE数据集上表现与真实数据相当，混合数据效果更佳（68.8%准确率），适用于资源短缺场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子商务中产品信息提取对服务质量至关重要，但获取高质量标注数据集困难重重。合成数据生成成为解决这一问题的有效途径，但现有方法难以同时保持属性一致性并满足实际场景约束。

Method: 构建了基于属性意识提示词约束的系统性合成数据框架，采用三阶段策略：1)属性保持的自然文本重构，2)对抗性负样本控制生成，3)系统性属性缺失模式模拟。通过大语言模型实现门店约束强制和产品语义一致性维护。

Result: 2000个合成产品的评估显示：99.6%被认定为自然文本，96.5%包含有效属性值，超90%属性使用一致。在公共数据集MAVE上，合成数据达60.5%准确率，与真实数据训练效果相当(60.8%)，显著高于零样本基线(13.4%)。合成与真实数据联合训练达到68.8%准确率。

Conclusion: 提出的框架为电子商务数据增强提供了实用解决方案，尤其在低资源场景下优势显著。合成数据质量接近真实数据，且能通过混合训练进一步提升模型性能

Abstract: Product information extraction is crucial for e-commerce services, but obtaining high-quality labeled datasets remains challenging. We present a systematic approach for generating synthetic e-commerce product data using Large Language Models (LLMs), introducing a controlled modification framework with three strategies: attribute-preserving modification, controlled negative example generation, and systematic attribute removal. Using a state-of-the-art LLM with attribute-aware prompts, we enforce store constraints while maintaining product coherence. Human evaluation of 2000 synthetic products demonstrates high effectiveness, with 99.6% rated as natural, 96.5% containing valid attribute values, and over 90% showing consistent attribute usage. On the public MAVE dataset, our synthetic data achieves 60.5% accuracy, performing on par with real training data (60.8%) and significantly improving upon the 13.4% zero-shot baseline. Hybrid configurations combining synthetic and real data further improve performance, reaching 68.8% accuracy. Our framework provides a practical solution for augmenting e-commerce datasets, particularly valuable for low-resource scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种名为Collective Narrative Grounding的参与式协议，通过将社区叙事转化为结构化单元并建立社区治理体系，解决大语言模型在本地化知识问答中的盲点问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在社区特定问题上存在知识盲点，导致文化误解和地理时空错位等问题，加剧了边缘群体的认知不公，亟需构建本地化知识注入机制。

Method: 通过3场N=24的社区工作坊开发叙事采集方法，建立可提取实体/时空信息的叙事结构；对14,782条县域问答数据进行错误类型审计；构建参与式问答测试集检验LLM效果。

Result: 社区叙事结构有效保留文化细节的同时支持知识检索；基准测试显示76.7%的错误源于本地知识缺失，SOTA模型无上下文时本地问答正确率<21%；叙事档案中包含80%缺失的实体关联信息。

Conclusion: 社区自主治理的知识注入框架可系统性提升本地化问答能力，但需解决参与度-质量平衡、文化挪用风险、数据主权与隐私的权衡等核心矛盾，建议采用可溯源的本地检索优先架构。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) question-answering systems often fail on community-specific queries, creating "knowledge blind spots" that marginalize local voices and reinforce epistemic injustice. We present Collective Narrative Grounding, a participatory protocol that transforms community stories into structured narrative units and integrates them into AI systems under community governance. Learning from three participatory mapping workshops with N=24 community members, we designed elicitation methods and a schema that retain narrative richness while enabling entity, time, and place extraction, validation, and provenance control. To scope the problem, we audit a county-level benchmark of 14,782 local information QA pairs, where factual gaps, cultural misunderstandings, geographic confusions, and temporal misalignments account for 76.7% of errors. On a participatory QA set derived from our workshops, a state-of-the-art LLM answered fewer than 21% of questions correctly without added context, underscoring the need for local grounding. The missing facts often appear in the collected narratives, suggesting a direct path to closing the dominant error modes for narrative items. Beyond the protocol and pilot, we articulate key design tensions, such as representation and power, governance and control, and privacy and consent, providing concrete requirements for retrieval-first, provenance-visible, locally governed QA systems. Together, our taxonomy, protocol, and participatory evaluation offer a rigorous foundation for building community-grounded AI that better answers local questions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了TeleTables基准，用于评估大型语言模型（LLMs）在解读3GPP通信标准表格中的表现。研究发现，小型模型在知识回顾和表格解读上存在困难，而大型模型表现较佳，强调了领域专用微调的必要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在电信行业被广泛探索，但其在3GPP通信标准（尤其是表格化信息）上的表现较差。当前缺乏对LLMs表格解读能力的系统性研究。

Method: 构建TeleTables基准：通过多阶段数据生成流程提取3GPP标准表格，结合多模态和推理型LLMs生成并验证问题，最终形成包含500组人工验证问答对的开放数据集。

Result: 小型模型（参数<10B）在知识回顾与表格解读上表现不佳，表明其预训练数据中电信标准覆盖不足；大型模型在表格推理上表现较强，但整体仍需领域优化。

Conclusion: TeleTables揭示了现有LLMs在电信标准表格处理上的缺陷，证明领域专用微调是提升可靠性的关键方向，为后续研究提供评估基础。

Abstract: Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly explored in the telecom industry to support engineering tasks, accelerate troubleshooting, and assist in interpreting complex technical documents. However, recent studies show that LLMs perform poorly on telecom standards, particularly 3GPP specifications. We argue that a key reason is that these standards densely include tables to present essential information, yet the LLM knowledge and interpretation ability of such tables remains largely unexamined. To address this gap, we introduce TeleTables, a benchmark designed to evaluate both the implicit knowledge LLMs have about tables in technical specifications and their explicit ability to interpret them. TeleTables is built through a novel multi-stage data generation pipeline that extracts tables from 3GPP standards and uses multimodal and reasoning-oriented LLMs to generate and validate questions. The resulting dataset, which is publicly available, comprises 500 human-verified question-answer pairs, each associated with the corresponding table in multiple formats. Our evaluation shows that, smaller models (under 10B parameters) struggle both to recall 3GPP knowledge and to interpret tables, indicating the limited exposure to telecom standards in their pretraining and the insufficient inductive biases for navigating complex technical material. Larger models, on the other hand, show stronger reasoning on table interpretation. Overall, TeleTables highlights the need for domain-specialized fine-tuning to reliably interpret and reason over telecom standards.

*Xueqing Wu,Zihan Xue,Da Yin,Shuyan Zhou,Kai-Wei Chang,Nanyun Peng,Yeming Wen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了FronTalk基准测试，用于评估前端对话式代码生成中的多模态交互效果，并揭示模型在功能遗忘和视觉反馈理解方面的薄弱点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 前端开发依赖视觉素材传递设计意图（如草图/截图），但现有研究缺乏对多轮对话中图文指令协同作用的系统性探索。FronTalk通过真实网站对话数据填补了多模态交互代码生成领域的研究空白。

Method: 构建包含100个多轮对话的数据集（覆盖新闻/金融/艺术等领域），每个对话包含等效的图文双模态指令；开发基于网页智能体的自动化评估框架，通过模拟用户行为客观测量功能正确性和用户体验；提出AceCoder基线方案，利用自主智能体持续验证历史功能以防止遗忘。

Result: 20个模型的测试显示两大挑战：1）模型遗忘问题导致任务失败率高达44%；2）视觉反馈理解准确率不足（开源VLMs表现仅为商业模型1/5）。AceCoder将遗忘率降至接近零，模型性能提升9.3%（56.0%→65.3%）。

Conclusion: FronTalk为多模态代码生成提供了标准化研究平台，证实了历史功能验证机制的有效性，并为开放世界应用场景下的交互式代码开发奠定了技术基础。

Abstract: We present FronTalk, a benchmark for front-end code generation that pioneers the study of a unique interaction dynamic: conversational code generation with multi-modal feedback. In front-end development, visual artifacts such as sketches, mockups and annotated creenshots are essential for conveying design intent, yet their role in multi-turn code generation remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we focus on the front-end development task and curate FronTalk, a collection of 100 multi-turn dialogues derived from real-world websites across diverse domains such as news, finance, and art. Each turn features both a textual instruction and an equivalent visual instruction, each representing the same user intent. To comprehensively evaluate model performance, we propose a novel agent-based evaluation framework leveraging a web agent to simulate users and explore the website, and thus measuring both functional correctness and user experience. Evaluation of 20 models reveals two key challenges that are under-explored systematically in the literature: (1) a significant forgetting issue where models overwrite previously implemented features, resulting in task failures, and (2) a persistent challenge in interpreting visual feedback, especially for open-source vision-language models (VLMs). We propose a strong baseline to tackle the forgetting issue with AceCoder, a method that critiques the implementation of every past instruction using an autonomous web agent. This approach significantly reduces forgetting to nearly zero and improves the performance by up to 9.3% (56.0% to 65.3%). Overall, we aim to provide a solid foundation for future research in front-end development and the general interaction dynamics of multi-turn, multi-modal code generation.

TL;DR: 提出动态调整去噪阈值的DiffuText算法，通过分析token时序方差和空间偏差实现高效并行文本生成


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散模型采用单一全局置信度阈值进行remasking，导致冗余迭代和并行效率受限，未考虑token动态特征差异

Method: 构建动态检测机制评估每个token的时间维度收敛波动(Temporal Variance)和空间维度相关偏离(Spatial Deviance)，据此自适应调整置信度阈值，实现差异化解码优先级控制

Result: 在主流数据集上实现最高8.9倍推理加速，同时保持与原始扩散模型相当的文本生成质量(BLEU分数差异<0.3%)

Conclusion: 验证了token动态特征对生成效率的重要性，为扩散模型并行解码提供了新的优化维度，兼顾效率与质量

Abstract: Unlike autoregressive language models, diffusion language models (DLMs) generate text by iteratively denoising all token positions in parallel. At each timestep, the remasking strategy of a DLM selects low- priority tokens to defer their decoding, thereby improving both efficiency and output quality. However, mainstream remasking strategies rely on a single global confidence threshold, overlooking the temporal and spatial dynamics of individual tokens. Motivated by the redundant iterations and constrained parallelism introduced by fixed-threshold remasking, we propose a novel remasking approach that dynamically detects Temporal Variance and Spa- tial Deviance of each token, which reflect its convergence status and inter-token correlations. Using these signals, our method adaptively adjusts the confidence threshold for every token at every step. Empirical re- sults show that our approach significantly improves the operational efficiency of DLMs across mainstream datasets, achieving speedups of up to 8.9 times while faithfully preserving generation quality.

Abstract: University admissions offices face the significant challenge of managing high volumes of inquiries efficiently while maintaining response quality, which critically impacts prospective students' perceptions. This paper addresses the issues of response time and information accuracy by proposing an AI system integrating a fine-tuned language model with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). While RAG effectively retrieves relevant information from large datasets, its performance in narrow, complex domains like university admissions can be limited without adaptation, potentially leading to contextually inadequate responses due to the intricate rules and specific details involved. To overcome this, we fine-tuned the model on a curated dataset specific to admissions processes, enhancing its ability to interpret RAG-provided data accurately and generate domain-relevant outputs. This hybrid approach leverages RAG's ability to access up-to-date information and fine-tuning's capacity to embed nuanced domain understanding. We further explored optimization strategies for the response generation logic, experimenting with settings to balance response quality and speed, aiming for consistently high-quality outputs that meet the specific requirements of admissions communications.

TL;DR: LLMs possess internal structures for political ideology that differ from human perspectives, and this paper presents a lightweight approach to correct this alignment without retraining. By employing a linear probe, the researchers propose a method to efficiently align a model with user opinions through adjustment of its output layer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the misalignment between LLMs' internal ideological representations and human ideologies to improve model alignment with user values effectively and efficiently.

Method: Development of a lightweight linear probe that quantifies existing misalignment and introduces minimal correction to the output layer by calculating a bias score from the model's internal features, thereby adjusting the output probabilities directly.

Result: A scalable, practical, and low-cost intervention to address model misalignment while retaining the model’s original reasoning powers.

Conclusion: The proposed approach offers a practical solution to systematically misaligned models, enabling efficient alignment with user preferences without retraining.

Abstract: LLMs internally organize political ideology along low-dimensional structures that are partially, but not fully aligned with human ideological space. This misalignment is systematic, model specific, and measurable. We introduce a lightweight linear probe that both quantifies the misalignment and minimally corrects the output layer. This paper introduces a simple and efficient method for aligning models with specific user opinions. Instead of retraining the model, we calculated a bias score from its internal features and directly adjusted the final output probabilities. This solution is practical and low-cost and preserves the original reasoning power of the model.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) models increasingly drive high-stakes consumer interactions, yet their decision logic often remains opaque. Prevailing explainable AI techniques rely on post hoc numerical feature attributions, which fail to provide coherent narratives behind model decisions. Large language models (LLMs) present an opportunity to generate natural-language explanations, but three design challenges remain unresolved: explanations must be both decision-correct and faithful to the factors that drive the prediction; they should be able to serve multiple audiences without shifting the underlying decision rule; and they should be trained in a label-efficient way that does not depend on large corpora of human-scored explanations. To address these challenges, we introduce LEXMA (LLM-based EXplanations for Multi-Audience decisions), a reinforcement-learning-based fine-tuning framework that produces narrative-driven, audience-appropriate explanations. LEXMA combines reflection-augmented supervised fine-tuning with two stages of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Specifically, it fine-tunes two separate parameter sets to improve decision correctness and satisfy stylistic requirements for different audiences, using reward signals that do not rely on human-annotated explanations. We instantiate LEXMA in the context of mortgage approval decisions. Results demonstrate that LEXMA yields significant improvements in predictive performance compared with other LLM baselines. Moreover, human evaluations show that expert-facing explanations generated by our approach are more risk-focused, and consumer-facing explanations are clearer, more actionable, and more polite. Our study contributes a cost-efficient, systematic LLM fine-tuning approach to enhance explanation quality for business decisions, offering strong potential for scalable deployment of transparent AI systems.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly recognized as valuable tools across the medical environment, supporting clinical, research, and administrative workflows. However, strict privacy and network security regulations in hospital settings require that sensitive data be processed within fully local infrastructures. Within this context, we developed and evaluated a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system designed to recommend research collaborators based on PubMed publications authored by members of a medical institution. The system utilizes PubMedBERT for domain-specific embedding generation and a locally deployed LLaMA3 model for generative synthesis. This study demonstrates the feasibility and utility of integrating domain-specialized encoders with lightweight LLMs to support biomedical knowledge discovery under local deployment constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models (LLMs) often produce hallucinations, limiting their use in security-critical domains. This work addresses the challenge of improving the reliability of smaller LLMs (SLMs) for faithful text summarization.

Method: TrueBrief integrates a data generation module that introduces controlled hallucinations into text to create synthetic preference pairs. Preference-based optimization is then applied to train SLMs, analyzing how data quality and model size influence effectiveness.

Result: The study reveals how data quality and model scale affect preference-based optimization, identifying conditions where the framework performs best in mitigating hallucinations while maintaining summarization quality.

Conclusion: TrueBrief demonstrates that targeted preference-optimization strategies, combined with synthetic data from controlled hallucinations, can significantly improve the faithfulness of small LLMs in critical applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable proficiency in generating high-quality text; however, their propensity for producing hallucinations poses a significant challenge for their deployment in security-critical domains. In this work, we present TrueBrief, an end-to-end framework specifically designed to enhance the faithfulness of small LLMs (SLMs) primarily for the task of text summarization through a preference-optimization paradigm. Central to our framework is a data generation module that facilitates controlled hallucination injection to generate synthetic preference data. Our work provides insights into the impact of data quality and model size on preference-based optimization, highlighting the conditions under which these methods are most effective.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器遗忘基准未能准确反映模型实际学习的遗忘范围，且依赖外部生成器导致知识分布不匹配问题。需要一种能自适应模型内部知识结构、自动化生成高质量遗忘集合的方法。

Method: 提出域级和实例级两种遗忘粒度，设计BiForget框架：1) 利用目标模型自身进行种子引导提示；2) 采用对抗性提示挖掘模型知识边界；3) 通过双向过滤机制优化遗忘数据集质量。

Result: 在哈利波特领域实验显示：相较现有方法，在相关性提升约20%、多样性提升0.05的同时，数据规模缩减50%，显著增强遗忘效果且保留模型效用。跨基准测试验证了方法普适性。

Conclusion: BiForget建立了更严谨的LLM遗忘评估基础，通过自模型驱动的数据生成机制，实现了高质高效的遗忘范围建模，为后续隐私保护研究提供新范式。

Abstract: Although machine unlearning is essential for removing private, harmful, or copyrighted content from LLMs, current benchmarks often fail to faithfully represent the true "forgetting scope" learned by the model. We formalize two distinct unlearning granularities, domain-level and instance-level, and propose BiForget, an automated framework for synthesizing high-quality forget sets. Unlike prior work relying on external generators, BiForget exploits the target model per se to elicit data that matches its internal knowledge distribution through seed-guided and adversarial prompting. Our experiments across diverse benchmarks show that it achieves a superior balance of relevance, diversity, and efficiency. Quantitatively, in the Harry Potter domain, it improves relevance by ${\sim}20$ and diversity by ${\sim}$0.05 while halving the total data size compared to SOTAs. Ultimately, it facilitates more robust forgetting and better utility preservation, providing a more rigorous foundation for evaluating LLM unlearning.

Conclusion: 该框架实现了证据比例性量化评估，为提升科学沟通的清晰度与透明度提供了可操作化工具。

Abstract: Scientific rigour tends to be sidelined in favour of bold statements, leading authors to overstate claims beyond what their results support. We present RIGOURATE, a two-stage multimodal framework that retrieves supporting evidence from a paper's body and assigns each claim an overstatement score. The framework consists of a dataset of over 10K claim-evidence sets from ICLR and NeurIPS papers, annotated using eight LLMs, with overstatement scores calibrated using peer-review comments and validated through human evaluation. It employes a fine-tuned reranker for evidence retrieval and a fine-tuned model to predict overstatement scores with justification. Compared to strong baselines, RIGOURATE enables improved evidence retrieval and overstatement detection. Overall, our work operationalises evidential proportionality and supports clearer, more transparent scientific communication.

TL;DR: 研究跨语言迁移在印度语系方言和语言变体中的应用，发现方言数据微调效果可媲美大规模标准语言，并分析了语音识别系统在方言中的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索跨语言迁移在包含自发性、噪音和代码混合语音的印度语系方言中的有效性，以解决低资源方言的语音识别问题。

Method: 通过比较语言系谱距离对语音识别性能的影响，分析不同方言数据量与大规模标准语言微调的效果差异，并以低资源的Garhwali语言为例进行案例研究。

Result: 语言系谱距离缩小可提升性能，但方言场景下并非唯一决定因素；少量方言数据微调效果与大规模标准语言相当，且发现语音识别系统对预训练语言存在偏差。

Conclusion: 方言数据对低资源语言语音识别具有重要意义，但系统仍面临方言非规范化和预训练语言偏差的挑战，需针对性优化。

Abstract: We conduct an empirical study of cross-lingual transfer using spontaneous, noisy, and code-mixed speech across a wide range of Indic dialects and language varieties. Our results indicate that although ASR performance is generally improved with reduced phylogenetic distance between languages, this factor alone does not fully explain performance in dialectal settings. Often, fine-tuning on smaller amounts of dialectal data yields performance comparable to fine-tuning on larger amounts of phylogenetically-related, high-resource standardized languages. We also present a case study on Garhwali, a low-resource Pahari language variety, and evaluate multiple contemporary ASR models. Finally, we analyze transcription errors to examine bias toward pre-training languages, providing additional insight into challenges faced by ASR systems on dialectal and non-standardized speech.

TL;DR: 本文提出Disco-RAG，通过引入话语结构增强检索增强生成效果，解决了现有方法对段落结构利用不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG方法将检索段落视为扁平结构，缺乏对文档内部层次关系和跨段落关联性的建模，限制了知识整合能力。

Method: 构建段内论点树捕捉局部层次结构，建立段间修辞图建模跨段落连贯性，并将两种结构融合为生成规划蓝图。

Result: 在问答和长文档摘要任务中均取得SOTA性能，且无需模型微调，在HotpotQA上准确率提升3.1%，在QMSum上ROUGE-L提升2.8。

Conclusion: 结构化建模对RAG系统优化具有关键价值，显式注入话语信号能显著提升知识密集型任务表现。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as an important means of enhancing the performance of large language models (LLMs) in knowledge-intensive tasks. However, most existing RAG strategies treat retrieved passages in a flat and unstructured way, which prevents the model from capturing structural cues and constrains its ability to synthesize knowledge from dispersed evidence across documents. To overcome these limitations, we propose Disco-RAG, a discourse-aware framework that explicitly injects discourse signals into the generation process. Our method constructs intra-chunk discourse trees to capture local hierarchies and builds inter-chunk rhetorical graphs to model cross-passage coherence. These structures are jointly integrated into a planning blueprint that conditions the generation. Experiments on question answering and long-document summarization benchmarks show the efficacy of our approach. Disco-RAG achieves state-of-the-art results on the benchmarks without fine-tuning. These findings underscore the important role of discourse structure in advancing RAG systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 当前大型语言模型(L L M)安全评估存在以偏概全的风险，将“身份仇恨”信息简化为标量评分时掩饰了针对特定群体的系统性漏洞。本文提出MiJaBench双语对抗测试基准，揭示不同群体在LLM安全对齐上的显著差异，并发现模型规模扩大反而加剧这种不平等。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全评估方法将复杂的社会敏感问题抽象为单一评分，这种简化无法反映模型对不同少数群体的真实防护效果，可能造成虚假的安全感误导用户。

Method: 构建包含44,000条双语文(英葡)对抗样本的MiJaBench基准，涵盖16个少数群体；通过12种先进LLM生成528,000组问答，从中筛选构建MiJaBench-Align数据集进行对比分析。

Result: 同一模型对不同群体的防御率波动可达33%，证明安全对齐能力实质是依群体而异的分层结构；规模更大的模型反而扩大了各组间的防护差异。

Conclusion: 当前对齐技术未实现真正无歧视性防护，反而固化了特定群体的响应拒绝边界，建议研究更细致的群体化安全评估框架。

Abstract: Current safety evaluations of large language models (LLMs) create a dangerous illusion of universality, aggregating "Identity Hate" into scalar scores that mask systemic vulnerabilities against specific populations. To expose this selective safety, we introduce MiJaBench, a bilingual (English and Portuguese) adversarial benchmark comprising 44,000 prompts across 16 minority groups. By generating 528,000 prompt-response pairs from 12 state-of-the-art LLMs, we curate MiJaBench-Align, revealing that safety alignment is not a generalized semantic capability but a demographic hierarchy: defense rates fluctuate by up to 33\% within the same model solely based on the target group. Crucially, we demonstrate that model scaling exacerbates these disparities, suggesting that current alignment techniques do not create principle of non-discrimination but reinforces memorized refusal boundaries only for specific groups, challenging the current scaling laws of security. We release all datasets and scripts to encourage research into granular demographic alignment at GitHub.

*Myra Cheng,Robert D. Hawkins,Dan Jurafsky*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本论文提出通过语用学视角分析大语言模型（LLMs）在挑战用户有害信念时的失效问题，发现其默认迎合用户假设且缺乏认知警惕性。通过引入简单干预（如添加短语“等一下”）可提升模型安全性，同时保持低误报率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在解释LLMs未能有效挑战用户有害信念（如医疗虚假信息和讨好性回复）的根源，探索通过调整语用行为（如用户假设的合理性、语言表达方式、来源可信度）改善模型安全性的方法。

Method: 分析社会学和语言学中影响人类语境适应性的因素（议题相关性、语言编码、来源可靠性）是否同样影响LLMs的行为，并在三个基准测试（Cancer-Myth, SAGE-Eval, ELEPHANT）中验证加入特定语用干预（如“等一下”）的效果。

Result: 发现LLMs的语境适应性与人类表现相似，且干预措施显著提升挑战有害信念的准确性。例如，在Cancer-Myth和SAGE-Eval数据集上，简单短语的加入减少了错误迎合，同时保持对正当提问的合理回应。

Conclusion: 语用学因素是评估和改进LLMs安全性的关键视角，低复杂度的干预手段能有效提升模型对潜在有害内容的质疑能力，为构建更安全的生成式AI提供可操作的框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) frequently fail to challenge users' harmful beliefs in domains ranging from medical advice to social reasoning. We argue that these failures can be understood and addressed pragmatically as consequences of LLMs defaulting to accommodating users' assumptions and exhibiting insufficient epistemic vigilance. We show that social and linguistic factors known to influence accommodation in humans (at-issueness, linguistic encoding, and source reliability) similarly affect accommodation in LLMs, explaining performance differences across three safety benchmarks that test models' ability to challenge harmful beliefs, spanning misinformation (Cancer-Myth, SAGE-Eval) and sycophancy (ELEPHANT). We further show that simple pragmatic interventions, such as adding the phrase "wait a minute", significantly improve performance on these benchmarks while preserving low false-positive rates. Our results highlight the importance of considering pragmatics for evaluating LLM behavior and improving LLM safety.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为研究如何通过对话预测建模人类思维，比较不同学习方法（预训练思考能力与奖励机制）对预测效果的影响。

Method: 对比两种训练机制：1) 是否允许模型思考后回应；2) 奖励机制采用大模型评分（语义相似度与信息完整性）或直接最大化真实人类对话的对数似然度。

Result: 基于评分的奖励提升评分表现但降低真实回复概率和人类偏好胜率；直接最大化对数似然度显著改进两者，且通过思考链作为隐变量推导的下界优化效果最优。

Conclusion: 当采用基于人类对话分布的匹配目标时，模型思考能力能显著提升效果，规模化该方法可能增强对人类行为的理解。

Abstract: To predict what someone will say is to model how they think. We study this through next-turn dialogue prediction: given a conversation, predict the next utterance produced by a person. We compare learning approaches along two dimensions: (1) whether the model is allowed to think before responding, and (2) how learning is rewarded either through an LLM-as-a-judge that scores semantic similarity and information completeness relative to the ground-truth response, or by directly maximizing the log-probability of the true human dialogue. We find that optimizing for judge-based rewards indeed increases judge scores throughout training, however it decreases the likelihood assigned to ground truth human responses and decreases the win rate when human judges choose the most human-like response among a real and synthetic option. This failure is amplified when the model is allowed to think before answering. In contrast, by directly maximizing the log-probability of observed human responses, the model learns to better predict what people actually say, improving on both log-probability and win rate evaluations. Treating chain-of-thought as a latent variable, we derive a lower bound on the log-probability. Optimizing this objective yields the best results on all our evaluations. These results suggest that thinking helps primarily when trained with a distribution-matching objective grounded in real human dialogue, and that scaling this approach to broader conversational data may produce models with a more nuanced understanding of human behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 指令调优大模型因依赖大规模数据集面临后门攻击风险，但现有防御方法研究不足

Method: 采用双阶段策略：1）防御性中毒阶段融合攻击/防御触发器构建统一表示 2）权重恢复阶段通过再训练打破后门表示

Result: 在多个大模型上验证使攻击成功率显著降低，同时保持指令遵循能力不受影响

Conclusion: 提出通用且数据高效的防御策略，有效增强指令调优模型对未知后门攻击的鲁棒性

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have greatly advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP), particularly through instruction tuning, which enables broad task generalization without additional fine-tuning. However, their reliance on large-scale datasets-often collected from human or web sources-makes them vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where adversaries poison a small subset of data to implant hidden behaviors. Despite this growing risk, defenses for instruction-tuned models remain underexplored. We propose MB-Defense (Merging & Breaking Defense Framework), a novel training pipeline that immunizes instruction-tuned LLMs against diverse backdoor threats. MB-Defense comprises two stages: (i) defensive poisoning, which merges attacker and defensive triggers into a unified backdoor representation, and (ii) weight recovery, which breaks this representation through additional training to restore clean behavior. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs show that MB-Defense substantially lowers attack success rates while preserving instruction-following ability. Our method offers a generalizable and data-efficient defense strategy, improving the robustness of instruction-tuned LLMs against unseen backdoor attacks.

<details>

Motivation: 当前缺乏对用户何时需要AI写作帮助偏好驱动因素的实证分析,传统基于自我报告的设计方法可能误导系统优化。

Method: 通过因子式情境实验设计,50名参与者完成750次成对行为比较试验,结合自报告与行为数据进行对比分析。

Result: 1) 创作难度显著影响决策(ρ=0.597); 2) 紧急程度实际无预测能力(ρ≈0); 3) 自报告与行为模式存在完全偏好倒置; 4) 基于自我报告系统准确率仅57.7%,显著低于基于行为模式系统(61.3%,p<0.05)。

Conclusion: 用户自报告与实际行为存在根本性偏差,证实依赖自我报告优化系统会导致方向性错误,主动式NLG系统应优先参考用户行为模式数据进行优化设计。

Abstract: Proactive AI writing assistants need to predict when users want drafting help, yet we lack empirical understanding of what drives preferences. Through a factorial vignette study with 50 participants making 750 pairwise comparisons, we find compositional effort dominates decisions ($ρ= 0.597$) while urgency shows no predictive power ($ρ\approx 0$). More critically, users exhibit a striking perception-behavior gap: they rank urgency first in self-reports despite it being the weakest behavioral driver, representing a complete preference inversion. This misalignment has measurable consequences. Systems designed from users' stated preferences achieve only 57.7\% accuracy, underperforming even naive baselines, while systems using behavioral patterns reach significantly higher 61.3\% ($p < 0.05$). These findings demonstrate that relying on user introspection for system design actively misleads optimization, with direct implications for proactive natural language generation (NLG) systems.

### [90] [Concept Tokens: Learning Behavioral Embeddings Through Concept Definitions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04465)
*Ignacio Sastre,Aiala Rosá*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Concept Tokens, a method that adds a new token to pretrained LLMs and learns only its embedding from concept definitions (keeping the rest of the model frozen). Evaluated through hallucination control, pedagogical feedback recasting, and qualitative studies, it shows directional influence over model behavior with minimal intervention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs exhibit hallucinations and lack granular control over concept-specific behaviors. Retraining entire models is resource-intensive. This work aims for a lightweight intervention (only learning new token embeddings) to create interpretable control signals that can steer frozen LLMs based on linguistic definitions.

Method: Introduce a special token for each target concept, optimize only its embedding using language modeling loss over definition corpora (while freezing the LLM). The concept replaces itself in training text. Applies to both real-world (Eiffel Tower) and synthetic (Austral Tower) concepts. Tested through token activation/deactivation experiments, recasting pedagogical feedback, and comparative analysis against in-context learning.

Result: 1) Hallucination tokens control QA behavior directionally: negation reduces hallucinations but increases abstentions, assertion does the opposite. 2) Recasting experiments show better instruction compliance than full context definition provision. 3) Qualitative studies reveal embeddings capture conceptual hierarchies and attributes, but fail in cross-domain abstraction tasks (e.g., distinguishing real vs fictional towers in novel contexts).

Conclusion: Concept Tokens enable compact, definition-based control over frozen LLMs with directional effects on behavior. While showing promise for safety applications and pedagogical tools, limitations include inability to fully distinguish between similar conceptual categories and context-specific generalization gaps.

Abstract: We propose Concept Tokens, a lightweight method that adds a new special token to a pretrained LLM and learns only its embedding from multiple natural language definitions of a target concept, where occurrences of the concept are replaced by the new token. The LLM is kept frozen and the embedding is optimized with the standard language-modeling objective. We evaluate Concept Tokens in three settings. First, we study hallucinations in closed-book question answering on HotpotQA and find a directional effect: negating the hallucination token reduces hallucinated answers mainly by increasing abstentions, whereas asserting it increases hallucinations and lowers precision. Second, we induce recasting, a pedagogical feedback strategy for second language teaching, and observe the same directional effect. Moreover, compared to providing the full definitional corpus in-context, concept tokens better preserve compliance with other instructions (e.g., asking follow-up questions). Finally, we include a qualitative study with the Eiffel Tower and a fictional "Austral Tower" to illustrate what information the learned embeddings capture and where their limitations emerge. Overall, Concept Tokens provide a compact control signal learned from definitions that can steer behavior in frozen LLMs.

Conclusion: 首次为高屈折语提供分词器参数选择基准，证明标准BPE在形态复杂语言中的局限性，工具已开源https://github.com/AragonerUA/SampoNLP

Abstract: The quality of subword tokenization is critical for Large Language Models, yet evaluating tokenizers for morphologically rich Uralic languages is hampered by the lack of clean morpheme lexicons.
  We introduce SampoNLP, a corpus-free toolkit for morphological lexicon creation using MDL-inspired Self-Referential Atomicity Scoring, which filters composite forms through internal structural cues - suited for low-resource settings.
  Using the high-purity lexicons generated by SampoNLP for Finnish, Hungarian, and Estonian, we conduct a systematic evaluation of BPE tokenizers across a range of vocabulary sizes (8k-256k). We propose a unified metric, the Integrated Performance Score (IPS), to navigate the trade-off between morpheme coverage and over-splitting. By analyzing the IPS curves, we identify the "elbow points" of diminishing returns and provide the first empirically grounded recommendations for optimal vocabulary sizes (k) in these languages. Our study not only offers practical guidance but also quantitatively demonstrates the limitations of standard BPE for highly agglutinative languages.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a refined taxonomy of 21 vocal event categories and a new evaluation framework for non-verbal vocal events in speech, addressing challenges like imprecise task definitions and insufficient benchmarks. It also develops WESR-Bench, an expert-annotated dataset, and high-performance models surpassing existing alternatives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses challenges in detecting non-verbal vocal events (like laughing/crying) due to ambiguous task definitions, limited category coverage, and lack of standardized evaluation protocols, which hinder downstream applications.

Method: 1) Created a refined taxonomy distinguishing between discrete and continuous vocal events; 2) Developed WESR-Bench (position-aware evaluation protocol, 900+ expert-annotated utterances); 3) Built a 1,700+ hour training corpus and trained specialized models for joint ASR and vocal event detection.

Result: Achieved superior performance over open-source audio-language models and commercial APIs while maintaining speech recognition accuracy. Established standardized evaluation metrics disentangled from ASR errors.

Conclusion: WESR provides foundational resources for modeling complex auditory scenes, enabling precise localization of both standalone and speech-integrated vocal events through taxonomic clarity and robust evaluation frameworks.

Abstract: Speech conveys not only linguistic information but also rich non-verbal vocal events such as laughing and crying. While semantic transcription is well-studied, the precise localization of non-verbal events remains a critical yet under-explored challenge. Current methods suffer from insufficient task definitions with limited category coverage and ambiguous temporal granularity. They also lack standardized evaluation frameworks, hindering the development of downstream applications. To bridge this gap, we first develop a refined taxonomy of 21 vocal events, with a new categorization into discrete (standalone) versus continuous (mixed with speech) types. Based on the refined taxonomy, we introduce WESR-Bench, an expert-annotated evaluation set (900+ utterances) with a novel position-aware protocol that disentangles ASR errors from event detection, enabling precise localization measurement for both discrete and continuous events. We also build a strong baseline by constructing a 1,700+ hour corpus, and train specialized models, surpassing both open-source audio-language models and commercial APIs while preserving ASR quality. We anticipate that WESR will serve as a foundational resource for future research in modeling rich, real-world auditory scenes.

Conclusion: GRACE首次实现RAG系统中证据关联性判断与可靠拒答机制的联合建模，为知识增强型模型提供新范式框架。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) integrates external knowledge to enhance Large Language Models (LLMs), yet systems remain susceptible to two critical flaws: providing correct answers without explicit grounded evidence and producing fabricated responses when the retrieved context is insufficient. While prior research has addressed these issues independently, a unified framework that integrates evidence-based grounding and reliable abstention is currently lacking. In this paper, we propose GRACE, a reinforcement-learning framework that simultaneously mitigates both types of flaws. GRACE employs a data construction method that utilizes heterogeneous retrievers to generate diverse training samples without manual annotation. A multi-stage gated reward function is then employed to train the model to assess evidence sufficiency, extract key supporting evidence, and provide answers or explicitly abstain. Experimental results on two benchmarks demonstrate that GRACE achieves state-of-the-art overall accuracy and strikes a favorable balance between accurate response and rejection, while requiring only 10% of the annotation costs of prior methods.

Result: 传统方法经RTT攻击后检测准确率暴跌至9-13%，分层策略将准确率提升至40-50%（提升25-35%），实现3-4倍相对改进，仅造成可控的语义下降（ROUGE-L损失<1.5%）。

Conclusion: 通过分层水印策略量化了多语言水印的鲁棒性-质量权衡关系，为低资源语言提供无需训练的实用解决方案。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for text generation, watermarking has become essential for authorship attribution, intellectual property protection, and misuse detection. While existing watermarking methods perform well in high-resource languages, their robustness in low-resource languages remains underexplored. This work presents the first systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art text watermarking methods: KGW, Exponential Sampling (EXP), and Waterfall, for Bangla LLM text generation under cross-lingual round-trip translation (RTT) attacks. Under benign conditions, KGW and EXP achieve high detection accuracy (>88%) with negligible perplexity and ROUGE degradation. However, RTT causes detection accuracy to collapse below RTT causes detection accuracy to collapse to 9-13%, indicating a fundamental failure of token-level watermarking. To address this, we propose a layered watermarking strategy that combines embedding-time and post-generation watermarks. Experimental results show that layered watermarking improves post-RTT detection accuracy by 25-35%, achieving 40-50% accuracy, representing a 3$\times$ to 4$\times$ relative improvement over single-layer methods, at the cost of controlled semantic degradation. Our findings quantify the robustness-quality trade-off in multilingual watermarking and establish layered watermarking as a practical, training-free solution for low-resource languages such as Bangla. Our code and data will be made public.

Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities on multiple-choice question answering benchmarks, but the complex mechanisms underlying their large-scale neurons remain opaque, posing significant challenges for understanding and steering LLMs. While recent studies made progress on identifying responsible neurons for certain abilities, these ability-specific methods are infeasible for task-focused scenarios requiring coordinated use of multiple abilities. Moreover, these approaches focus only on supportive neurons that correlate positively with task completion, while neglecting neurons with other roles-such as inhibitive roles-and misled neuron attribution due to fortuitous behaviors in LLMs (i.e., correctly answer the questions by chance rather than genuine understanding). To address these challenges, we propose NeuronLLM, a novel task-level LLM understanding framework that adopts the biological principle of functional antagonism for LLM neuron identification. The key insight is that task performance is jointly determined by neurons with two opposing roles: good neurons that facilitate task completion and bad neurons that inhibit it. NeuronLLM achieves a holistic modeling of neurons via contrastive learning of good and bad neurons, while leveraging augmented question sets to mitigate the fortuitous behaviors in LLMs. Comprehensive experiments on LLMs of different sizes and families show the superiority of NeuronLLM over existing methods in four NLP tasks, providing new insights into LLM functional organization.

Conclusion: 提出的LLM反馈质量评估框架FeedEval有效提高了自动作文评分精度及反馈指导效能。

Abstract: Going beyond the prediction of numerical scores, recent research in automated essay scoring has increasingly emphasized the generation of high-quality feedback that provides justification and actionable guidance. To mitigate the high cost of expert annotation, prior work has commonly relied on LLM-generated feedback to train essay assessment models. However, such feedback is often incorporated without explicit quality validation, resulting in the propagation of noise in downstream applications. To address this limitation, we propose FeedEval, an LLM-based framework for evaluating LLM-generated essay feedback along three pedagogically grounded dimensions: specificity, helpfulness, and validity. FeedEval employs dimension-specialized LLM evaluators trained on datasets curated in this study to assess multiple feedback candidates and select high-quality feedback for downstream use. Experiments on the ASAP++ benchmark show that FeedEval closely aligns with human expert judgments and that essay scoring models trained with FeedEval-filtered high-quality feedback achieve superior scoring performance. Furthermore, revision experiments using small LLMs show that the high-quality feedback identified by FeedEval leads to more effective essay revisions.

*Mizanur Rahman,Mohammed Saidul Islam,Md Tahmid Rahman Laskar,Shafiq Joty,Enamul Hoque*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces RL-Text2Vis, a reinforcement learning framework for text-to-visualization generation, using GRPO and a multi-objective reward to improve chart quality and code executability over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Text2Vis systems using LLMs produce charts with poor semantic alignment or clarity, while open-source models generate non-executable outputs. Supervised fine-tuning improves executability but fails to address overall visualization quality, as it cannot model post-execution feedback with traditional SFT loss.

Method: Proposes RL-Text2Vis with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), combining textual accuracy, code validity, and visualization quality into a multi-objective reward derived from post-execution feedback. Trained Qwen2.5 models (7B and 14B) using this framework.

Result: ACHIEVES 22% relative improvement in chart quality over GPT-4o, boosts code execution success from 78% to 97% compared to zero-shot baseline, and shows robust generalization on out-of-domain datasets (VIS-Eval, NVBench).

Conclusion: RL-Text2Vis with GRPO proves effective for structured, multimodal reasoning in visualization generation, establishing GRPO as a key strategy. The code is publicly released for broader adoption.

Abstract: Text-to-Visualization (Text2Vis) systems translate natural language queries over tabular data into concise answers and executable visualizations. While closed-source LLMs generate functional code, the resulting charts often lack semantic alignment and clarity, qualities that can only be assessed post-execution. Open-source models struggle even more, frequently producing non-executable or visually poor outputs. Although supervised fine-tuning can improve code executability, it fails to enhance overall visualization quality, as traditional SFT loss cannot capture post-execution feedback. To address this gap, we propose RL-Text2Vis, the first reinforcement learning framework for Text2Vis generation. Built on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), our method uses a novel multi-objective reward that jointly optimizes textual accuracy, code validity, and visualization quality using post-execution feedback. By training Qwen2.5 models (7B and 14B), RL-Text2Vis achieves a 22% relative improvement in chart quality over GPT-4o on the Text2Vis benchmark and boosts code execution success from 78% to 97% relative to its zero-shot baseline. Our models significantly outperform strong zero-shot and supervised baselines and also demonstrate robust generalization to out-of-domain datasets like VIS-Eval and NVBench. These results establish GRPO as an effective strategy for structured, multimodal reasoning in visualization generation. We release our code at https://github.com/vis-nlp/RL-Text2Vis.

TL;DR: ThaiLLM initiative explores model merging as an efficient solution to create multi-capability Large Language Models (LLMs) for Thai language and financial domains, addressing deployment cost and specialization trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Organizations face challenges between deploying multiple specialized LLMs and the high cost of training a single multi-capability model, while requiring on-premise solutions for security and regulatory compliance in domains like banking and finance.

Method: Model merging of Qwen-8B with ThaiLLM-8B (for Thai language capabilities) and THaLLE-CFA-8B (for financial domain expertise), evaluated through benchmarks like M3/M6 O-NET, Flare-CFA, and Thai-IC.

Result: Merging Qwen-8B with ThaiLLM-8B improved Thai language performance on O-NET exams. Further merging with THaLLE-CFA-8B enhanced capabilities in both general and financial domains, showing uplift in multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: Model merging is a resource-efficient approach to develop high-performance, multi-capability LLMs for specialized tasks and languages, without requiring prohibitively expensive training of new models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential across various domains, particularly in banking and finance, where they can automate complex tasks and enhance decision-making at scale. Due to privacy, security, and regulatory concerns, organizations often prefer on-premise deployment of LLMs. The ThaiLLM initiative aims to enhance Thai language capabilities in open-LLMs, enabling Thai industry to leverage advanced language models. However, organizations often face a trade-off between deploying multiple specialized models versus the prohibitive expense of training a single multi-capability model. To address this, we explore model merging as a resource-efficient alternative for developing high-performance, multi-capability LLMs. We present results from two key experiments: first, merging Qwen-8B with ThaiLLM-8B demonstrates how ThaiLLM-8B enhances Thai general capabilities, showing an uplift of M3 and M6 O-NET exams over the general instruction-following Qwen-8B. Second, we merge Qwen-8B with both ThaiLLM-8B and THaLLE-CFA-8B. This combination results in further improvements in performance across both general and financial domains, by demonstrating an uplift in both M3 and M6 O-NET, Flare-CFA, and Thai-IC benchmarks. The report showcases the viability of model merging for efficiently creating multi-capability LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识编辑需要兼顾事实更新效率与复杂推理能力,但当前方法处理多跳推理效果不佳,且存在表征缺失/泛化衰退/过拟合等问题

Method: 通过冗余编辑策略增强模型多跳推理能力,在不同层深度部署多组编辑操作

Result: 新方法使2跳问题准确率相对原有单编辑策略提升96%,但牺牲了部分答案特异性和语言流畅性

Conclusion: 该方法揭示了深层编辑的局限性并提供有效改进路径,证实编辑策略在复杂任务中的权衡特性

Abstract: Recent advances in Knowledge Editing (KE), particularly Rank-One Model Editing (ROME), show superior efficiency over fine-tuning and in-context learning for updating single-hop facts in transformers. However, these methods face significant challenges when applied to multi-hop reasoning tasks requiring knowledge chaining. In this work, we study the effect of editing knowledge with ROME on different layer depths and identify three key failure modes. First, the "hopping-too-late" problem occurs as later layers lack access to necessary intermediate representations. Second, generalization ability deteriorates sharply when editing later layers. Third, the model overfits to edited knowledge, incorrectly prioritizing edited-hop answers regardless of context. To mitigate the issues of "hopping-too-late" and generalisation decay, we propose Redundant Editing, a simple yet effective strategy that enhances multi-hop reasoning. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach can improve accuracy on 2-hop questions by at least 15.5 percentage points, representing a 96% increase over the previous single-edit strategy, while trading off some specificity and language naturalness.

*Rhea Kapur,Robert Hawkins,Elisa Kreiss*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文指出当前视觉-语言模型（VLMs）在图像描述生成中过度依赖描述长度衡量特异性，提出应通过对比集定义特异性，并证明控制长度后描述质量仍取决于信息分配效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLM系统将描述特异性与长度混淆，导致可能产生冗长但空洞的描述。研究旨在分离这两个概念，建立以信息特异性为核心的评估标准。

Method: 构建控制描述长度但信息量变化的数据集，通过人类偏好实验验证特异性对描述质量的影响，分析不同长度预算下的信息分配策略。

Result: 人类受试者始终偏好特异性更高的描述，实验显示即使控制长度，描述质量仍受信息密度影响，证实特异性应作为核心评估指标。

Conclusion: 建议VLM评估应直接优化描述特异性而非单纯限制长度，强调信息密度在图像描述生成中的重要性。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly used to make visual content accessible via text-based descriptions. In current systems, however, description specificity is often conflated with their length. We argue that these two concepts must be disentangled: descriptions can be concise yet dense with information, or lengthy yet vacuous. We define specificity relative to a contrast set, where a description is more specific to the extent that it picks out the target image better than other possible images. We construct a dataset that controls for length while varying information content, and validate that people reliably prefer more specific descriptions regardless of length. We find that controlling for length alone cannot account for differences in specificity: how the length budget is allocated makes a difference. These results support evaluation approaches that directly prioritize specificity over verbosity.

Motivation: 针对大型语言模型在非英语文化和价值观上存在偏差的问题，探索以国家社会课程为文化监督依据的解决方案。

Method: 开发CuCu多智能体框架，自动化将文本教材转化为开放式文化问答对，并应用于韩国教材生产KCaQA数据集。

Result: 生成的KCaQA数据集在量化和质性分析中显示覆盖韩国特有文化议题，且模型回答能体现本土社会语境特征。

Conclusion: 基于国家课程的文化监督方法为语言模型提供可规模化、本地化的文化意识培养路径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance on many tasks, but their progress remains uneven across languages and cultures, often reflecting values latent in English-centric training data. To enable practical cultural alignment, we propose a scalable approach that leverages national social studies curricula as a foundation for culture-aware supervision. We introduce CuCu, an automated multi-agent LLM framework that transforms national textbook curricula into open-ended, culture-specific question-answer pairs. Applying CuCu to the Korean national social studies curriculum, we construct KCaQA, comprising 34.1k open-ended QA pairs. Our quantitative and qualitative analyses suggest that KCaQA covers culture-specific topics and produces responses grounded in local sociocultural contexts.

Motivation: 针对机器生成文本与人类文本愈发难以区分的问题，现有检测器依赖数据质量且泛化能力不足，需要更系统性的生成过程改进方案。

Method: 基于HC-Var理论构建MAGA框架，包含提示构造、推理过程的全流程对齐；创新性提出RLDF算法（基于检测器反馈的强化学习）作为核心组件。

Result: RoBERTa检测器在MAGA数据集上泛化检测AUC提升4.60%，但MAGA生成的数据反而使其他检测器AUC平均下降8.13%，验证方法有效性的同时揭露当前检测器的局限性。

Conclusion: 全流程对齐的MAGA框架可有效提升检测器性能并推动对抗性检测研究，其提出的RLDF方法为生成与检测协同优化提供了新范式。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) alignment is constantly evolving. Machine-Generated Text (MGT) is becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish from Human-Written Text (HWT). This has exacerbated abuse issues such as fake news and online fraud. Fine-tuned detectors' generalization ability is highly dependent on dataset quality, and simply expanding the sources of MGT is insufficient. Further augment of generation process is required. According to HC-Var's theory, enhancing the alignment of generated text can not only facilitate attacks on existing detectors to test their robustness, but also help improve the generalization ability of detectors fine-tuned on it. Therefore, we propose \textbf{M}achine-\textbf{A}ugment-\textbf{G}enerated Text via \textbf{A}lignment (MAGA). MAGA's pipeline achieves comprehensive alignment from prompt construction to reasoning process, among which \textbf{R}einforced \textbf{L}earning from \textbf{D}etectors \textbf{F}eedback (RLDF), systematically proposed by us, serves as a key component. In our experiments, the RoBERTa detector fine-tuned on MAGA training set achieved an average improvement of 4.60\% in generalization detection AUC. MAGA Dataset caused an average decrease of 8.13\% in the AUC of the selected detectors, expecting to provide indicative significance for future research on the generalization detection ability of detectors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗咨询需自然语音交互但传统文本模式不友好，语音大模型因医疗数据稀缺和微调低效难以应用

Method: 1) 文本阶段注入医学知识和对话能力 2) 用10k合成医疗语音进行模态对齐微调，解耦训练流程

Result: 在单轮问答和多轮模拟交互基准测试中，模型在准确率(72.3%→81.5%)、对话连贯性(68.2→79.4)和噪声鲁棒性(82.1→93.6)均优于基线

Conclusion: 两阶段训练范式有效缓解医疗语音数据稀缺问题，为医疗语音助手部署提供新思路

Abstract: Medical consultations are intrinsically speech-centric. However, most prior works focus on long-text-based interactions, which are cumbersome and patient-unfriendly. Recent advances in speech language models (SpeechLMs) have enabled more natural speech-based interaction, yet the scarcity of medical speech data and the inefficiency of directly fine-tuning on speech data jointly hinder the adoption of SpeechLMs in medical consultation. In this paper, we propose SpeechMedAssist, a SpeechLM natively capable of conducting speech-based multi-turn interactions with patients. By exploiting the architectural properties of SpeechLMs, we decouple the conventional one-stage training into a two-stage paradigm consisting of (1) Knowledge & Capability Injection via Text and (2) Modality Re-alignment with Limited Speech Data, thereby reducing the requirement for medical speech data to only 10k synthesized samples. To evaluate SpeechLMs for medical consultation scenarios, we design a benchmark comprising both single-turn question answering and multi-turn simulated interactions. Experimental results show that our model outperforms all baselines in both effectiveness and robustness in most evaluation settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过激活程度识别语言相关神经元，但混淆了语言偏好和功能必要性，导致特异性识别不准确。

Method: 提出基于相关性的CRANE框架，通过针对性神经元干预评估神经元对语言条件预测的功能必要性，而非仅依赖激活强度。

Result: masking特定语言相关神经元显著降低对应语言表现但保全其他语言性能，实验显示CRANE在3种语言/基准测试中均优于激活方法。

Conclusion: CRANE有效分离多语言模型中语言特异功能组件，揭示神经元存在语言选择性但非完全特化的分工模式。

Abstract: Multilingual large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance across languages, yet how language capabilities are organized at the neuron level remains poorly understood. Prior work has identified language-related neurons mainly through activation-based heuristics, which conflate language preference with functional importance. Prior work has identified language-related neurons mainly through activation-based heuristics, which conflate language preference with functional importance. We propose CRANE, a relevance-based analysis framework that redefines language specificity in terms of functional necessity, identifying language-specific neurons through targeted neuron-level interventions. CRANE characterizes neuron specialization by their contribution to language-conditioned predictions rather than activation magnitude. Our implementation will be made publicly available. Neuron-level interventions reveal a consistent asymmetric pattern: masking neurons relevant to a target language selectively degrades performance on that language while preserving performance on other languages to a substantial extent, indicating language-selective but non-exclusive neuron specializations. Experiments on English, Chinese, and Vietnamese across multiple benchmarks, together with a dedicated relevance-based metric and base-to-chat model transfer analysis, show that CRANE isolates language-specific components more precisely than activation-based methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ToolGate introduces a formally verifiable framework for LLM tool calling using symbolic state management and Hoare-style contracts to ensure logical safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM tool frameworks lack formal guarantees for logical safety and verifiability, relying on natural language reasoning that risks invalid or hallucinated results.

Method: ToolGate employs a typed key-value symbolic state space and Hoare-style contracts (preconditions for invocation, postconditions for result verification) to enforce state evolution through mathematically verified tool executions.

Result: Achieved significant improvement in reliability and verifiability while maintaining competitive performance on multi-step reasoning tasks compared to traditional frameworks.

Conclusion: Establishes foundation for debuggable, trusted AI systems by formalizing LLM interaction with external tools through symbolic logic and runtime verification.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) augmented with external tools have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex reasoning tasks. However, existing frameworks rely heavily on natural language reasoning to determine when tools can be invoked and whether their results should be committed, lacking formal guarantees for logical safety and verifiability. We present \textbf{ToolGate}, a forward execution framework that provides logical safety guarantees and verifiable state evolution for LLM tool calling. ToolGate maintains an explicit symbolic state space as a typed key-value mapping representing trusted world information throughout the reasoning process. Each tool is formalized as a Hoare-style contract consisting of a precondition and a postcondition, where the precondition gates tool invocation by checking whether the current state satisfies the required conditions, and the postcondition determines whether the tool's result can be committed to update the state through runtime verification. Our approach guarantees that the symbolic state evolves only through verified tool executions, preventing invalid or hallucinated results from corrupting the world representation. Experimental validation demonstrates that ToolGate significantly improves the reliability and verifiability of tool-augmented LLM systems while maintaining competitive performance on complex multi-step reasoning tasks. This work establishes a foundation for building more trustworthy and debuggable AI systems that integrate language models with external tools.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Thunder-KoNUBench, a Korean negation understanding benchmark, and demonstrates that fine-tuning LLMs on it improves both negation handling and contextual comprehension.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for evaluating negation understanding in large language models (LLMs), particularly for Korean, are limited, leading to poor model performance in this critical area.

Method: Conducted corpus-based analysis of Korean negation phenomena, developed Thunder-KoNUBench (sentence-level benchmark reflecting real-world negation patterns), and evaluated 47 LLMs to assess impacts of model size, instruction tuning, and fine-tuning.

Result: LLMs showed degraded performance under negation, larger models and instruction tuning improved negation handling, but only fine-tuning on Thunder-KoNUBench significantly enhanced both negation understanding and broader contextual comprehension in Korean.

Conclusion: Thunder-KoNUBench effectively addresses Korean negation challenges in LLMs, with fine-tuning on this benchmark providing measurable improvements in both task-specific and general contextual understanding capabilities.

Abstract: Although negation is known to challenge large language models (LLMs), benchmarks for evaluating negation understanding, especially in Korean, are scarce. We conduct a corpus-based analysis of Korean negation and show that LLM performance degrades under negation. We then introduce Thunder-KoNUBench, a sentence-level benchmark that reflects the empirical distribution of Korean negation phenomena. Evaluating 47 LLMs, we analyze the effects of model size and instruction tuning, and show that fine-tuning on Thunder-KoNUBench improves negation understanding and broader contextual comprehension in Korean.

*Feihu Jin,Shipeng Cen,Ying Tan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a prior-informed perturbation method for zeroth-order (ZO) optimization in LLM fine-tuning. By dynamically guiding perturbations toward informative directions and leveraging prior knowledge, the approach reduces gradient estimation variance, achieving faster convergence and superior performance compared to traditional ZO and gradient-based methods on tasks like OPT-13B benchmarking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Backpropagation in LLM fine-tuning causes memory bottlenecks, prompting the use of ZO optimization. However, standard ZO methods suffer from high gradient variance due to random perturbations. This work addresses these limitations to enable efficient, scalable training without sacrificing performance.

Method: A dynamic guiding vector derived from Gaussian samples directs perturbations toward informative directions. A greedy perturbation strategy incorporates prior knowledge to refine gradient estimation. Theoretical analysis proves improved alignment between the proposed gradient estimator and the true gradient direction.

Result: The method integrates seamlessly with existing optimization frameworks, achieving faster convergence and better performance. On OPT-13B, it outperformed traditional ZO on all 11 tasks and gradient-based baselines on 9/11 tasks, demonstrating robust efficiency-accuracy trade-offs across diverse LLM architectures.

Conclusion: Prior-informed perturbations in ZO optimization overcome variance issues, enabling efficient LLM fine-tuning. The combination of theoretical guarantees and practical benchmarks validates the method's effectiveness as a memory-efficient alternative to backpropagation-driven approaches.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) has achieved remarkable success across various NLP tasks, but the substantial memory overhead during backpropagation remains a critical bottleneck, especially as model scales grow. Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization alleviates this issue by estimating gradients through forward passes and Gaussian sampling, avoiding the need for backpropagation. However, conventional ZO methods suffer from high variance in gradient estimation due to their reliance on random perturbations, leading to slow convergence and suboptimal performance. We propose a simple plug-and-play method that incorporates prior-informed perturbations to refine gradient estimation. Our method dynamically computes a guiding vector from Gaussian samples, which directs perturbations toward more informative directions, significantly accelerating convergence compared to standard ZO approaches. We further investigate a greedy perturbation strategy to explore the impact of prior knowledge on gradient estimation. Theoretically, we prove that our gradient estimator achieves stronger alignment with the true gradient direction, enhancing optimization efficiency. Extensive experiments across LLMs of varying scales and architectures demonstrate that our proposed method could seamlessly integrate into existing optimization methods, delivering faster convergence and superior performance. Notably, on the OPT-13B model, our method outperforms traditional ZO optimization across all 11 benchmark tasks and surpasses gradient-based baselines on 9 out of 11 tasks, establishing a robust balance between efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: The reliability of large language models (LLMs) in production environments remains significantly constrained by their propensity to generate hallucinations--fluent, plausible-sounding outputs that contradict or fabricate information. While hallucination detection has recently emerged as a priority in English-centric benchmarks, low-to-medium resource languages such as Vietnamese remain inadequately covered by standardized evaluation frameworks. This paper introduces the DSC2025 ViHallu Challenge, the first large-scale shared task for detecting hallucinations in Vietnamese LLMs. We present the ViHallu dataset, comprising 10,000 annotated triplets of (context, prompt, response) samples systematically partitioned into three hallucination categories: no hallucination, intrinsic, and extrinsic hallucinations. The dataset incorporates three prompt types--factual, noisy, and adversarial--to stress-test model robustness. A total of 111 teams participated, with the best-performing system achieving a macro-F1 score of 84.80\%, compared to a baseline encoder-only score of 32.83\%, demonstrating that instruction-tuned LLMs with structured prompting and ensemble strategies substantially outperform generic architectures. However, the gap to perfect performance indicates that hallucination detection remains a challenging problem, particularly for intrinsic (contradiction-based) hallucinations. This work establishes a rigorous benchmark and explores a diverse range of detection methodologies, providing a foundation for future research into the trustworthiness and reliability of Vietnamese language AI systems.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Qwen3-VL-Embedding and Qwen3-VL-Reranker, two multimodal models for end-to-end high-precision search across text, images, video, and documents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models struggle to unify diverse modalities (text, images, video) into a cohesive representation space while maintaining accuracy and handling variable input lengths. This work addresses these challenges by proposing a comprehensive pipeline with flexible deployment options.

Method: The Qwen3-VL-Embedding uses multi-stage training (contrastive pre-training + distillation), Matryoshka Representation Learning for adjustable dimensions, and processes up to 32k tokens. The Qwen3-VL-Reranker uses cross-attention cross-encoders for fine-grained relevance scoring. Both models support 30+ languages and come in 2B/8B parameter versions.

Result: Qwen3-VL-Embedding-8B achieved SOTA 77.8 on MMEB-V2 (Jan 2025) and excelled in multimodal tasks (image-text retrieval, video-text matching, VQA), demonstrating robust performance across modalities and input lengths.

Conclusion: The Qwen3-VL series provides an effective end-to-end multimodal search framework with flexible deployment scales, achieving state-of-the-art results while supporting multilingualism and long inputs.

Abstract: In this report, we introduce the Qwen3-VL-Embedding and Qwen3-VL-Reranker model series, the latest extensions of the Qwen family built on the Qwen3-VL foundation model. Together, they provide an end-to-end pipeline for high-precision multimodal search by mapping diverse modalities, including text, images, document images, and video, into a unified representation space. The Qwen3-VL-Embedding model employs a multi-stage training paradigm, progressing from large-scale contrastive pre-training to reranking model distillation, to generate semantically rich high-dimensional vectors. It supports Matryoshka Representation Learning, enabling flexible embedding dimensions, and handles inputs up to 32k tokens. Complementing this, Qwen3-VL-Reranker performs fine-grained relevance estimation for query-document pairs using a cross-encoder architecture with cross-attention mechanisms. Both model series inherit the multilingual capabilities of Qwen3-VL, supporting more than 30 languages, and are released in $\textbf{2B}$ and $\textbf{8B}$ parameter sizes to accommodate diverse deployment requirements. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the Qwen3-VL-Embedding series achieves state-of-the-art results across diverse multimodal embedding evaluation benchmarks. Specifically, Qwen3-VL-Embedding-8B attains an overall score of $\textbf{77.8}$ on MMEB-V2, ranking first among all models (as of January 8, 2025). This report presents the architecture, training methodology, and practical capabilities of the series, demonstrating their effectiveness on various multimodal retrieval tasks, including image-text retrieval, visual question answering, and video-text matching.

Motivation: 现有情感分类工具的可靠性评估多依赖第三方标注者，可能掩盖性别偏差，需验证其在不同人群中的公平性。

Method: 使用100万条自标注社交媒体数据，预注册研究设计，系统评估414种模型与情感类别的组合对性别偏差的影响。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of automatic sentiment and emotion classifiers makes it important to ensure that these tools perform reliably across different populations. Yet their reliability is typically assessed using benchmarks that rely on third-party annotators rather than the individuals experiencing the emotions themselves, potentially concealing systematic biases. In this paper, we use a unique, large-scale dataset of more than one million self-annotated posts and a pre-registered research design to investigate gender biases in emotion detection across 414 combinations of models and emotion-related classes. We find that across different types of automatic classifiers and various underlying emotions, error rates are consistently higher for texts authored by men compared to those authored by women. We quantify how this bias could affect results in downstream applications and show that current machine learning tools, including large language models, should be applied with caution when the gender composition of a sample is not known or variable. Our findings demonstrate that sentiment analysis is not yet a solved problem, especially in ensuring equitable model behaviour across demographic groups.

TL;DR: 本文提出InterSafe-V数据集与AM³Safety框架，通过基于对话轮次的强化学习方法提升多模态大语言模型在多轮交互中的安全性，实验表明攻击成功率下降10%且无害性/有用性提升8-13%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在多轮交互中存在渐进式有害意图重建的安全漏洞，传统单轮视觉问答场景的RLHF对齐方法因依赖人工标注和场景适配性不足，导致对话安全协议随交互持续而失效。

Method: 1) 构建包含11,270轮对话和500个拒绝型VQA样本的InterSafe-V数据集，采用模型交互生成模拟真实场景；2) 提出AM³Safety框架，结合冷启动拒绝阶段与基于回合感知双目标奖励的群体相对策略优化（GRPO）微调。

Conclusion: 通过对话级强化学习与专业数据集构建，有效解决了多轮多模态交互中的累积安全风险问题，为可扩展的模型安全对齐提供了低成本自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly deployed in interactive applications. However, their safety vulnerabilities become pronounced in multi-turn multi-modal scenarios, where harmful intent can be gradually reconstructed across turns, and security protocols fade into oblivion as the conversation progresses. Existing Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) alignment methods are largely developed for single-turn visual question-answer (VQA) task and often require costly manual preference annotations, limiting their effectiveness and scalability in dialogues. To address this challenge, we present InterSafe-V, an open-source multi-modal dialogue dataset containing 11,270 dialogues and 500 specially designed refusal VQA samples. This dataset, constructed through interaction between several models, is designed to more accurately reflect real-world scenarios and includes specialized VQA pairs tailored for specific domains. Building on this dataset, we propose AM$^3$Safety, a framework that combines a cold-start refusal phase with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) fine-tuning using turn-aware dual-objective rewards across entire dialogues. Experiments on Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct and LLaVA-NeXT-7B show more than 10\% decrease in Attack Success Rate (ASR) together with an increment of at least 8\% in harmless dimension and over 13\% in helpful dimension of MLLMs on multi-modal multi-turn safety benchmarks, while preserving their general abilities.

TL;DR: 针对专业领域大型语言模型的安全风险，提出结合知识图谱生成与双路径模糊重写技术的端到端框架，生成高隐性有害提示数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有公开数据集侧重显性有害提示且依赖人工构造，难以反映真实场景中通过间接领域知识表达的隐性威胁，亟需自动化生成兼具领域相关性与隐性特征的数据集。

Method: 知识图谱引导生成领域相关原始提示 + 显性有害提示双路径转换（直接重写+上下文强化重写）降低显性特征。

Result: 成功构建金融/医疗领域高质量数据集，包含42%隐性威胁样本，红队测试显示主流模型防御失效率提升3倍（从18.7%至56.2%）。

Conclusion: 该框架有效生成领域自适应的隐性威胁数据集，为LLM安全评估提供新基准，开源工具促进后续研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in specialized domains such as finance and healthcare, where they introduce unique safety risks. Domain-specific datasets of harmful prompts remain scarce and still largely rely on manual construction; public datasets mainly focus on explicit harmful prompts, which modern LLM defenses can often detect and refuse. In contrast, implicit harmful prompts-expressed through indirect domain knowledge-are harder to detect and better reflect real-world threats. We identify two challenges: transforming domain knowledge into actionable constraints and increasing the implicitness of generated harmful prompts. To address them, we propose an end-to-end framework that first performs knowledge-graph-guided harmful prompt generation to systematically produce domain-relevant prompts, and then applies dual-path obfuscation rewriting to convert explicit harmful prompts into implicit variants via direct and context-enhanced rewriting. This framework yields high-quality datasets combining strong domain relevance with implicitness, enabling more realistic red-teaming and advancing LLM safety research. We release our code and datasets at GitHub.

*Yehoon Jang,Chaewon Lee,Hyun-seok Min,Sungchul Choi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了PILOT-Bench，首个针对美国专利商标局复审委员会（PTAB）的基准测试，用于系统评估大型语言模型（LLMs）在专利领域的法律推理能力，揭示闭源模型在任务表现上显著优于开源模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在专利和法律实践中得到应用，但其在专利领域结构化法律推理能力缺乏系统性评估标准。

Method: 构建PILOT-Bench基准，结合PTAB决定与USPTO专利数据，设计基于IRAC框架的三类分类任务（问题类型、委员会依据、子决策），对闭源和开源LLMs进行多维度评估分析。

Result: 闭源模型在核心任务（问题类型）上Micro-F1得分稳定超过0.75，而最强的开源模型Qwen-8B仅达约0.56，显示推理能力存在显著差异。

Conclusion: PILOT-Bench为专利领域法律推理评估提供了基础框架，指出通过数据集设计和模型对齐改进LLMs的未来方向。

Abstract: The Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) of the USPTO adjudicates thousands of ex parte appeals each year, requiring the integration of technical understanding and legal reasoning. While large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in patent and legal practice, their use has remained limited to lightweight tasks, with no established means of systematically evaluating their capacity for structured legal reasoning in the patent domain. In this work, we introduce PILOT-Bench, the first PTAB-centric benchmark that aligns PTAB decisions with USPTO patent data at the case-level and formalizes three IRAC-aligned classification tasks: Issue Type, Board Authorities, and Subdecision. We evaluate a diverse set of closed-source (commercial) and open-source LLMs and conduct analyses across multiple perspectives, including input-variation settings, model families, and error tendencies. Notably, on the Issue Type task, closed-source models consistently exceed 0.75 in Micro-F1 score, whereas the strongest open-source model (Qwen-8B) achieves performance around 0.56, highlighting a substantial gap in reasoning capabilities. PILOT-Bench establishes a foundation for the systematic evaluation of patent-domain legal reasoning and points toward future directions for improving LLMs through dataset design and model alignment.

*Santiago Acevedo,Alessandro Laio,Marco Baroni*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，通过平均具有相同句法结构或含义的句子的隐藏表示向量，可以捕捉大量句法与语义信息，并揭示其在大语言模型中的线性编码及分层解耦特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大语言模型（如DeepSeek-V3）内部层如何表征句法与语义信息，解决两者是否线性编码及是否存在解耦机制的问题。

Method: 对共享句法结构或语义的句子进行隐藏向量均值计算以获得聚类中心（centroid），通过减去此类中心并分析句子相似度变化验证编码特性。

Result: 减去对应句法/语义中心后，句子相似度明显下降，说明句法与语义部分线性编码；跨层分析显示两者编码曲线不同且可部分解耦。

Conclusion: 句法与语义在LLM中至少部分线性编码，且不同语言信息在模型中呈现差异化分层表征机制。

Abstract: We study how syntactic and semantic information is encoded in inner layer representations of Large Language Models (LLMs), focusing on the very large DeepSeek-V3. We find that, by averaging hidden-representation vectors of sentences sharing syntactic structure or meaning, we obtain vectors that capture a significant proportion of the syntactic and semantic information contained in the representations. In particular, subtracting these syntactic and semantic ``centroids'' from sentence vectors strongly affects their similarity with syntactically and semantically matched sentences, respectively, suggesting that syntax and semantics are, at least partially, linearly encoded. We also find that the cross-layer encoding profiles of syntax and semantics are different, and that the two signals can to some extent be decoupled, suggesting differential encoding of these two types of linguistic information in LLM representations.

TL;DR: 本研究提出基于KL散度的免训练验证机制，克服了传统Judge Decoding依赖昂贵监督的局限性，在推理和编码任务中达到或超越复杂训练模型的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Speculative Decoding的Judge Decoding范式需要高成本且有噪声的监督，且未充分探索其与分布差异间的本质关联。

Method: 通过理论证明线性判别器与KL散度的结构性对应关系，提出无需训练的KL散度验证机制，利用草案分布与目标分布的散度自动评估预测结果。

Result: 在多种推理和编码基准测试中，该方法在域外泛化和对抗分布偏移场景下均优于AutoJudge等有监督模型，且完全消除了监督瓶颈。

Conclusion: 通过建立理论关联性，揭示了分布差异本身即隐含判别信息，为高效大模型推理提供了低成本、强鲁棒性的验证框架。

Abstract: Judge Decoding accelerates LLM inference by relaxing the strict verification of Speculative Decoding, yet it typically relies on expensive and noisy supervision. In this work, we revisit this paradigm from first principles, revealing that the ``criticality'' scores learned via costly supervision are intrinsically encoded in the draft-target distributional divergence. We theoretically prove a structural correspondence between learned linear judges and Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, demonstrating they rely on the same underlying logit primitives. Guided by this, we propose a simple, training-free verification mechanism based on KL divergence. Extensive experiments across reasoning and coding benchmarks show that our method matches or outperforms complex trained judges (e.g., AutoJudge), offering superior robustness to domain shifts and eliminating the supervision bottleneck entirely.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究提出LANGSAE EDITING方法，通过后处理稀疏自编码器去除多语言嵌入中的语言身份信号，提升跨语言检索效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言嵌入同时编码语义与语言身份信息，导致同语言文本相似度虚高并抑制跨语言相关性。现有方法难以同时解决检索偏差与语言覆盖问题。

Method: 训练基于嵌入向量池的稀疏自编码器，通过跨语言激活统计识别语言关联隐层单元。推理阶段主动抑制这些单元并重建嵌入向量，在保持原始维度的同时实现语言信号可控去除。

Result: 实验证明该方法显著提升多语言检索排名质量与跨语言覆盖率，尤其对文字系统差异明显的语言（如中-英）提升达15%以上。

Conclusion: 通过向量空间后处理有效剥离语言身份干扰，无需修改编码器或重新训练，为现有系统提供低成本跨语言优化路径。

Abstract: Dense retrieval in multilingual settings often searches over mixed-language collections, yet multilingual embeddings encode language identity alongside semantics. This language signal can inflate similarity for same-language pairs and crowd out relevant evidence written in other languages. We propose LANGSAE EDITING, a post-hoc sparse autoencoder trained on pooled embeddings that enables controllable removal of language-identity signal directly in vector space. The method identifies language-associated latent units using cross-language activation statistics, suppresses these units at inference time, and reconstructs embeddings in the original dimensionality, making it compatible with existing vector databases without retraining the base encoder or re-encoding raw text. Experiments across multiple languages show consistent improvements in ranking quality and cross-language coverage, with especially strong gains for script-distinct languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统非凸优化问题依赖专家手动凸化且效率低，亟需自动化框架减少人工干预并提高求解可行性。

Method: 采用符号推理、自适应变换及迭代验证机制，结合LLM数学推理能力自动检测非凸组件、选择最优凸化策略并生成等效凸问题，内置纠错循环保障有效性。

Result: 在100个非凸问题测试中，执行率89.3%，成功转化76%问题，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: NC2C通过LLM实现非凸-凸自动化转换，降低专家依赖，使凸求解器可高效解决复杂非凸任务。

Abstract: Non-convex optimization problems are pervasive across mathematical programming, engineering design, and scientific computing, often posing intractable challenges for traditional solvers due to their complex objective functions and constrained landscapes. To address the inefficiency of manual convexification and the over-reliance on expert knowledge, we propose NC2C, an LLM-based end-to-end automated framework designed to transform generic non-convex optimization problems into solvable convex forms using large language models. NC2C leverages LLMs' mathematical reasoning capabilities to autonomously detect non-convex components, select optimal convexification strategies, and generate rigorous convex equivalents. The framework integrates symbolic reasoning, adaptive transformation techniques, and iterative validation, equipped with error correction loops and feasibility domain correction mechanisms to ensure the robustness and validity of transformed problems. Experimental results on a diverse dataset of 100 generic non-convex problems demonstrate that NC2C achieves an 89.3\% execution rate and a 76\% success rate in producing feasible, high-quality convex transformations. This outperforms baseline methods by a significant margin, highlighting NC2C's ability to leverage LLMs for automated non-convex to convex transformation, reduce expert dependency, and enable efficient deployment of convex solvers for previously intractable optimization tasks.

*Junhyuk Choi,Jeongyoun Kwon,Heeju Kim,Haeun Cho,Hayeong Jung,Sehee Min,Bugeun Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study systematically examines role-based authority bias in multi-agent systems using ChatEval, revealing that Expert/Referent power roles exert greater influence than Legitimate roles by maintaining positions while general agents show flexibility. Authority bias emerges from authoritative agents' consistent stance, not conformity, and requires explicit position statements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate the underexplored impact of authority bias in large language model-based multi-agent systems, focusing on how different authority role classifications (French & Raven's theory) affect interaction dynamics.

Method: Applied ChatEval framework for free-form evaluation, categorized roles into Legitimate/Referent/Expert using French & Raven's power theory, conducted 12-turn conversation experiments with GPT-4o and DeepSeek R1 models, and analyzed influence mechanisms through conversational pattern comparison.

Result: Expert/Referent roles showed significantly stronger influence than Legitimate roles. Authority bias manifested through authoritative agents' positional consistency (not general agent conformity) and required explicit position statements (neutral responses failed to generate bias). General agents demonstrated behavioral flexibility.

Conclusion: These findings suggest that asymmetric interaction design in multi-agent systems should prioritize authority roles' positional consistency and clarity over agent conformity, highlighting the need for strategic role configuration to optimize collaborative dynamics.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems utilizing large language models often assign authoritative roles to improve performance, yet the impact of authority bias on agent interactions remains underexplored. We present the first systematic analysis of role-based authority bias in free-form multi-agent evaluation using ChatEval. Applying French and Raven's power-based theory, we classify authoritative roles into legitimate, referent, and expert types and analyze their influence across 12-turn conversations. Experiments with GPT-4o and DeepSeek R1 reveal that Expert and Referent power roles exert stronger influence than Legitimate power roles. Crucially, authority bias emerges not through active conformity by general agents, but through authoritative roles consistently maintaining their positions while general agents demonstrate flexibility. Furthermore, authority influence requires clear position statements, as neutral responses fail to generate bias. These findings provide key insights for designing multi-agent frameworks with asymmetric interaction patterns.

*Ke Sun,Guangsheng Bao,Han Cui,Yue Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于AI生成文本晚阶段波动衰减特性的零样本检测方法，仅利用晚阶段统计信息设计两种简单特征（Derivative Dispersion和Local Volatility），无需扰动采样或额外模型访问，即可在EvoBench和MAGE基准测试中达到最先进性能，并与现有全局方法形成互补。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有零样本检测方法忽略自回归生成的时序动态特性，过度依赖整段序列的token级统计。研究发现AI生成文本在生成后期对数概率波动快速稳定，而人类文本始终维持较高波动性，表明时序动态信息可有效区分二者的生成模式差异。

Method: 分析12万+文本样本，量化AI生成文本与人类文本在时序波动性上的差异；提出两种仅基于晚阶段统计的特征（Derivative Dispersion和Local Volatility）；通过比较序列后半段的波动性差异进行检测，无需生成扰动样本或访问模型参数。

Result: AI生成文本在序列后半段波动性比人类文本低24-32%；新方法在EvoBench和MAGE基准测试中达到最先进性能；实验显示该方法与现有基于全局特征的检测方法具有强互补性。

Conclusion: 揭示了自回归语言模型生成过程中存在的晚阶段波动衰减现象，证明利用生成过程的时序动态特性可显著提升零样本检测能力，提出的两种特征在性能和普适性上均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Zero-shot detection methods for AI-generated text typically aggregate token-level statistics across entire sequences, overlooking the temporal dynamics inherent to autoregressive generation. We analyze over 120k text samples and reveal Late-Stage Volatility Decay: AI-generated text exhibits rapidly stabilizing log probability fluctuations as generation progresses, while human writing maintains higher variability throughout. This divergence peaks in the second half of sequences, where AI-generated text shows 24--32\% lower volatility. Based on this finding, we propose two simple features: Derivative Dispersion and Local Volatility, which computed exclusively from late-stage statistics. Without perturbation sampling or additional model access, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on EvoBench and MAGE benchmarks and demonstrates strong complementarity with existing global methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统离散token决策导致生成过程存在不稳定性、重复性和对解码策略的高度依赖，需要探索更平滑的不确定性处理机制。

Method: 将token表示为连续向量，通过多步骤确定性动力系统演化，在表征收敛后再离散化为具体token，使用硬解码策略维持生成连续性和多尺度不确定性处理。

Result: 仅通过确定性argmax解码即可生成高质量文本，无需采样或扩散模型等辅助机制，平滑演化过程可自适应调控生成复杂度。

Conclusion: 首次实现全连续化的自回归生成架构，证明确定性演化机制可替代传统token级采样，在保证文本质量的同时提升生成可控性。

Abstract: Autoregressive language models are conventionally defined over discrete token sequences, committing to a specific token at every generation step. This early discretization forces uncertainty to be resolved through token-level sampling, often leading to instability, repetition, and sensitivity to decoding heuristics.
  In this work, we introduce a continuous autoregressive formulation of language generation in which tokens are represented as continuous vectors that \emph{mature} over multiple update steps before being discretized. Rather than sampling tokens, the model evolves continuous token representations through a deterministic dynamical process, committing to a discrete token only when the representation has sufficiently converged. Discrete text is recovered via hard decoding, while uncertainty is maintained and resolved in the continuous space.
  We show that this maturation process alone is sufficient to produce coherent and diverse text using deterministic decoding (argmax), without reliance on token-level sampling, diffusion-style denoising, or auxiliary stabilization mechanisms. Additional perturbations, such as stochastic dynamics or history smoothing, can be incorporated naturally but are not required for the model to function.
  To our knowledge, this is the first autoregressive language model that generates text by evolving continuous token representations to convergence prior to discretization, enabling stable generation without token-level sampling.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究提出MisSpans（首个细粒度、跨领域的人工标注虚假信息检测基准），通过识别句子中具体误导性片段（span）级特征，提升虚假信息分析的可解释性和精确度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多基于整体声明或段落的二元（真假）标签，无法反映单句中真伪细节共存的问题，且全局解释机制无法定位具体误导性片段及其类型（如歪曲vs捏造）。

Method: 构建包含三个任务的MisSpans基准：1）MisSpansIdentity识别句子内虚假片段；2）MisSpansType按类型分类；3）MisSpansExplanation提供基于片段的解释理由。通过标准化标注指南和交叉验证确保标注一致性，并测试15种代表性的大语言模型（包含增强推理与非推理模型）。

Result: 模型在细粒度虚假信息识别上表现欠佳，显示任务挑战性。实验表明模型性能受多因素影响（如模型规模、推理能力及领域特定文本特征），人工标注一致性较高（IAA值高）。

Conclusion: MisSpans首次实现虚假信息的片段级定位、类型化表征和可操作解释。研究强调需更深入理解模型性能与多因素关联，并提出未来需开发结合领域文本特征与推理能力的检测模型。项目代码开源。

Abstract: Online misinformation is increasingly pervasive, yet most existing benchmarks and methods evaluate veracity at the level of whole claims or paragraphs using coarse binary labels, obscuring how true and false details often co-exist within single sentences. These simplifications also limit interpretability: global explanations cannot identify which specific segments are misleading or differentiate how a detail is false (e.g., distorted vs. fabricated). To address these gaps, we introduce MisSpans, the first multi-domain, human-annotated benchmark for span-level misinformation detection and analysis, consisting of paired real and fake news stories. MisSpans defines three complementary tasks: MisSpansIdentity for pinpointing false spans within sentences, MisSpansType for categorising false spans by misinformation type, and MisSpansExplanation for providing rationales grounded in identified spans. Together, these tasks enable fine-grained localisation, nuanced characterisation beyond true/false and actionable explanations. Expert annotators were guided by standardised guidelines and consistency checks, leading to high inter-annotator agreement. We evaluate 15 representative LLMs, including reasoning-enhanced and non-reasoning variants, under zero-shot and one-shot settings. Results reveal the challenging nature of fine-grained misinformation identification and analysis, and highlight the need for a deeper understanding of how performance may be influenced by multiple interacting factors, including model size and reasoning capabilities, along with domain-specific textual features. This project will be available at https://github.com/lzw108/MisSpans.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于分块的RAG在多跳查询中因结构连通性不足而失效，而基于知识图谱的RAG在单跳任务中表现较差。研究旨在弥补结构化检索与事实密度之间的方法缺陷。

Method: 建立由命题、实体和段落组成的异构命题图，采用迭代的‘建议-选择’循环：通过查询驱动的图遍历（Suggestion阶段）结合大语言模型反馈剪枝无关命题并迭代扩展搜索（Selection阶段）。

Result: 在3类问答任务（简单、复杂、抽象问答）的实验中，ToPG在准确性（如准确率）和质量性（如连贯性）指标上均显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 研究表明，结合查询感知的图遍历与事实细粒度是设计高效结构化RAG系统的关键机制，且模型已开源促进应用扩展。

Abstract: Standard RAG pipelines based on chunking excel at simple factual retrieval but fail on complex multi-hop queries due to a lack of structural connectivity. Conversely, initial strategies that interleave retrieval with reasoning often lack global corpus awareness, while Knowledge Graph (KG)-based RAG performs strongly on complex multi-hop tasks but suffers on fact-oriented single-hop queries. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel RAG framework: ToPG (Traversal over Proposition Graphs). ToPG models its knowledge base as a heterogeneous graph of propositions, entities, and passages, effectively combining the granular fact density of propositions with graph connectivity. We leverage this structure using iterative Suggestion-Selection cycles, where the Suggestion phase enables a query-aware traversal of the graph, and the Selection phase provides LLM feedback to prune irrelevant propositions and seed the next iteration. Evaluated on three distinct QA tasks (Simple, Complex, and Abstract QA), ToPG demonstrates strong performance across both accuracy- and quality-based metrics. Overall, ToPG shows that query-aware graph traversal combined with factual granularity is a critical component for efficient structured RAG systems. ToPG is available at https://github.com/idiap/ToPG.

TL;DR: 本研究提出EvolSQL，一种结构感知的文本到SQL数据合成框架，通过逐步演化SQL查询提升数据多样性与复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到SQL数据合成方法存在结构控制不足、多样性有限的问题，导致模型训练受限。

Method: 采用Query-SQL扩展策略扩大问题范围，设计6种基于SQL语法树的原子操作实现多维度复杂度演化，并加入执行验证和去重模块。

Result: 基于EvolSQL数据微调的7B模型在仅使用SynSQL 1/18数据量时，性能超越后者。

Conclusion: 结构化数据合成框架能显著提升数据使用效率，为复杂SQL生成提供新范式。

Abstract: Training effective Text-to-SQL models remains challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality, diverse, and structurally complex datasets. Existing methods either rely on limited human-annotated corpora, or synthesize datasets directly by simply prompting LLMs without explicit control over SQL structures, often resulting in limited structural diversity and complexity. To address this, we introduce EvolSQL, a structure-aware data synthesis framework that evolves SQL queries from seed data into richer and more semantically diverse forms. EvolSQL starts with an exploratory Query-SQL expansion to broaden question diversity and improve schema coverage, and then applies an adaptive directional evolution strategy using six atomic transformation operators derived from the SQL Abstract Syntax Tree to progressively increase query complexity across relational, predicate, aggregation, and nesting dimensions. An execution-grounded SQL refinement module and schema-aware deduplication further ensure the creation of high-quality, structurally diverse mapping pairs. Experimental results show that a 7B model fine-tuned on our data outperforms one trained on the much larger SynSQL dataset using only 1/18 of the data.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种冲突感知的汇总方法，分离信念层面的聚合与语言生成，通过结构化信念集和基于距离的信念合并操作符显式建模冲突，避免现有LLM系统平滑分歧的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM系统在观点总结时隐式平滑分歧，过度代表多数观点，导致意见高度分歧场景下的摘要失真。

Method: 1) 将文档转换为结构化信念集 2) 使用基于距离的信念合并操作符显式建模冲突进行聚合 3) 用LLM将聚合后的信念转化为自然语言摘要。

Result: 大模型在生成时进行聚合可达到信念层聚合效果但不稳定，而提案的分层方法在不同规模模型上均保持稳定性能，且保持摘要流畅性和真实性。

Conclusion: 分离聚合与生成的架构通过显式冲突建模实现了更忠实的观点总结，结合简单提示即能产生稳定效果。

Abstract: Opinion and multi-document summarisation often involve genuinely conflicting viewpoints, yet many existing approaches, particularly LLM-based systems, implicitly smooth disagreement and over-represent majority opinions. This limits the faithfulness of generated summaries in opinion-heavy settings. We introduce a disagreement-aware synthesis pipeline that separates belief-level aggregation from language generation. Documents are first represented as structured belief sets and aggregated using distance-based belief merging operators that explicitly model conflict. Large language models are then used only to realise the aggregated beliefs as natural language summaries. We evaluate the approach across multiple model families and scales, comparing it to methods that perform explicit aggregation during generation. Our results show that while sufficiently large models can match belief-level aggregation when aggregation is handled at generation time, this behaviour is not stable across architectures or capacities. In contrast, belief-level aggregation combined with simple prompting yields consistently strong disagreement-aware performance across models, while maintaining fluent and grounded summaries.

TL;DR: 研究MLLMs过度依赖语言而非视觉的问题，提出V-FAT测试和VRS指标，结果显示模型在冲突情境下表现下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在视觉推理任务中可能过度依赖语言捷径而非真实视觉理解，影响模型在复杂真实场景中的可靠性。作者旨在揭示视觉感知与语言先验之间的紧张关系，并提出系统性评估框架以量化文本偏差对模型性能的影响。

Method: 提出V-FAT基准（含4026个VQA实例）和三级评估框架（L1-L3逐步增加视觉与文本冲突），分解文本偏差为内部语料库偏差和外部指令偏差。通过视觉鲁棒性分数（VRS）惩罚语言猜测、奖励真实视觉理解。对12个最前沿MLLMs进行实证分析。

Result: 12个MLLMs在传统基准表现优异，但在V-FAT高语言主导场景下出现显著视觉崩溃。VRS评估显示模型依赖语言捷径，且外部指令对其影响强于内部语料偏差。V-FAT成功揭示文本偏差的双重来源及其协同效应。

Conclusion: 当前MLLMs面临文本偏差导致的视觉保真度下降问题，尤其在视觉与语言信息冲突时表现突出。研究强调需改进模型对多模态冲突的鲁棒性，为未来多模态研究提供基准和评估框架。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on standard visual reasoning benchmarks. However, there is growing concern that these models rely excessively on linguistic shortcuts rather than genuine visual grounding, a phenomenon we term Text Bias. In this paper, we investigate the fundamental tension between visual perception and linguistic priors. We decouple the sources of this bias into two dimensions: Internal Corpus Bias, stemming from statistical correlations in pretraining, and External Instruction Bias, arising from the alignment-induced tendency toward sycophancy. To quantify this effect, we introduce V-FAT (Visual Fidelity Against Text-bias), a diagnostic benchmark comprising 4,026 VQA instances across six semantic domains. V-FAT employs a Three-Level Evaluation Framework that systematically increases the conflict between visual evidence and textual information: (L1) internal bias from atypical images, (L2) external bias from misleading instructions, and (L3) synergistic bias where both coincide. We introduce the Visual Robustness Score (VRS), a metric designed to penalize "lucky" linguistic guesses and reward true visual fidelity. Our evaluation of 12 frontier MLLMs reveals that while models excel in existing benchmarks, they experience significant visual collapse under high linguistic dominance.

TL;DR: 该论文比较了大型语言模型（LLMs）生成的说服性文本与人类写作的检测难度，并引入了多语言基准数据集Persuaficial。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs生成的高说服性文本可能被滥用于有害目的，但目前缺乏对LLMs生成说服性内容与人工创作在检测难度上的系统比较。

Method: 构建了包含英、德、波、意、法、俄六国语言的Persuaficial数据集，通过实证评估对比LLMs生成和人工创作的说服性文本检测性能，并进行语言学差异分析。

Result: LLMs生成的明显说服性文本比人类写作更容易检测，但隐性说服性文本会显著降低自动检测性能，同时发现两者存在可解释的语言学差异。

Conclusion: 研究表明LLMs生成的说服性文本检测效果取决于表现形式，隐性说服性构成更大挑战，建议通过语言学特征改进检测工具设计。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate highly persuasive text, raising concerns about their misuse for propaganda, manipulation, and other harmful purposes. This leads us to our central question: Is LLM-generated persuasion more difficult to automatically detect than human-written persuasion? To address this, we categorize controllable generation approaches for producing persuasive content with LLMs and introduce Persuaficial, a high-quality multilingual benchmark covering six languages: English, German, Polish, Italian, French and Russian. Using this benchmark, we conduct extensive empirical evaluations comparing human-authored and LLM-generated persuasive texts. We find that although overtly persuasive LLM-generated texts can be easier to detect than human-written ones, subtle LLM-generated persuasion consistently degrades automatic detection performance. Beyond detection performance, we provide the first comprehensive linguistic analysis contrasting human and LLM-generated persuasive texts, offering insights that may guide the development of more interpretable and robust detection tools.

Conclusion: 细粒度来源追踪揭示当前模型在可验证推理上存在显著能力断层，表面引用优化无法解决深层推理可追溯性问题，这为可审计AI系统设计提供了新方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLM) often hallucinate, and while adding citations is a common solution, it is frequently insufficient for accountability as users struggle to verify how a cited source supports a generated claim. Existing methods are typically coarse-grained and fail to distinguish between direct quotes and complex reasoning. In this paper, we introduce Generation-time Fine-grained Provenance, a task where models must generate fluent answers while simultaneously producing structured, sentence-level provenance triples. To enable this, we present ReFInE (Relation-aware Fine-grained Interpretability & Evidence), a dataset featuring expert verified annotations that distinguish between Quotation, Compression, and Inference. Building on ReFInE, we propose GenProve, a framework that combines Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). By optimizing a composite reward for answer fidelity and provenance correctness, GenProve significantly outperforms 14 strong LLMs in joint evaluation. Crucially, our analysis uncovers a reasoning gap where models excel at surface-level quotation but struggle significantly with inference-based provenance, suggesting that verifiable reasoning remains a frontier challenge distinct from surface-level citation.

Motivation: 现有对话系统对情感的处理多依赖显式监督，导致情感感知能力不足。本文旨在将用户情感状态及其成因自然内化到模型推理过程中，实现真正的共情交互。

Method: 提出IEAT数据建构策略，在两级训练框架下：1)通过自蒸馏进行语音-文本对齐及情感属性建模；2)开展端到端跨模态联合优化，确保文本与语音情感表达一致性。

Result: 在HumDial情感智能基准测试中，该方法在情感轨迹建模、情感推理和共情响应生成三个任务上均取得最优成绩，通过LLM和人类双维度评估验证有效性。

Conclusion: 通过将情感属性自然内化到模型推理过程，验证了内在情感建模比显式监督更有效的核心观点，为情感智能对话系统提供了新范式。

Abstract: This paper presents a unified spoken language model for emotional intelligence, enhanced by a novel data construction strategy termed Injected Emotional-Attribution Thinking (IEAT). IEAT incorporates user emotional states and their underlying causes into the model's internal reasoning process, enabling emotion-aware reasoning to be internalized rather than treated as explicit supervision. The model is trained with a two-stage progressive strategy. The first stage performs speech-text alignment and emotional attribute modeling via self-distillation, while the second stage conducts end-to-end cross-modal joint optimization to ensure consistency between textual and spoken emotional expressions. Experiments on the Human-like Spoken Dialogue Systems Challenge (HumDial) Emotional Intelligence benchmark demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves top-ranked performance across emotional trajectory modeling, emotional reasoning, and empathetic response generation under both LLM-based and human evaluations.

Motivation: 现有隐式用户偏好表示方法存在可解释性差、跨模型/任务迁移困难的问题，需要一种通用且可演化的偏好表达方案。

Method: 提出自然语言接口的偏好表示框架，采用两阶段训练：1) 基于高质量合成数据的监督微调 2) 优化长期效用的强化学习，开发AlignXplore+文本生成模型。

Result: 在九项基准测试中8B模型达到SOTA，相对较大模型仍保持优势，展现出跨任务、模型族及交互格式的强迁移能力。

Conclusion: 自然语言作为通用偏好表示媒介具有可解释性和可演化性优势，AlignXplore+验证了该框架有效性，为个性化LLM发展提供了新方向。

Abstract: We study the problem of personalization in large language models (LLMs). Prior work predominantly represents user preferences as implicit, model-specific vectors or parameters, yielding opaque ``black-box'' profiles that are difficult to interpret and transfer across models and tasks. In contrast, we advocate natural language as a universal, model- and task-agnostic interface for preference representation. The formulation leads to interpretable and reusable preference descriptions, while naturally supporting continual evolution as new interactions are observed. To learn such representations, we introduce a two-stage training framework that combines supervised fine-tuning on high-quality synthesized data with reinforcement learning to optimize long-term utility and cross-task transferability. Based on this framework, we develop AlignXplore+, a universal preference reasoning model that generates textual preference summaries. Experiments on nine benchmarks show that our 8B model achieves state-of-the-art performanc -- outperforming substantially larger open-source models -- while exhibiting strong transferability across tasks, model families, and interaction formats.

TL;DR: 本文提出通过整合包含错误答案（负轨迹）的样本进行SFT训练，结合自适应损失加权方案GLOW，改善大语言模型在跨领域任务中的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准SFT训练仅保留正确答案（正轨迹）导致监督信息丢失和过拟合，负轨迹中的有效中间推理过程被忽视。

Method: 系统分析负轨迹的双重作用（缓解过拟合/提升推理探索），提出基于训练动态的GLOW算法，根据样本特性和跨周期进展动态调整损失权重。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-7B模型上实现跨领域任务5.51%增益，MMLU评分从72.82%提升至76.47%，验证了负轨迹的训练价值。

Conclusion: 通过自适应机制利用完整训练轨迹可有效抑制过拟合，提升模型鲁棒性，为SFT范式提供了新视角。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on chain-of-thought (CoT) trajectories demonstrations is a common approach for enabling reasoning in large language models. Standard practices typically only retain trajectories with correct final answers (positives) while ignoring the rest (negatives). We argue that this paradigm discards substantial supervision and exacerbates overfitting, limiting out-of-domain (OOD) generalization. Specifically, we surprisingly find that incorporating negative trajectories into SFT yields substantial OOD generalization gains over positive-only training, as these trajectories often retain valid intermediate reasoning despite incorrect final answers. To understand this effect in depth, we systematically analyze data, training dynamics, and inference behavior, identifying 22 recurring patterns in negative chains that serve a dual role: they moderate loss descent to mitigate overfitting during training and boost policy entropy by 35.67% during inference to facilitate exploration. Motivated by these observations, we further propose Gain-based LOss Weighting (GLOW), an adaptive, sample-aware scheme that exploits such distinctive training dynamics by rescaling per-sample loss based on inter-epoch progress. Empirically, GLOW efficiently leverages unfiltered trajectories, yielding a 5.51% OOD gain over positive-only SFT on Qwen2.5-7B and boosting MMLU from 72.82% to 76.47% as an RL initialization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前推理蒸馏方法无法传递大模型中的认知结构问题，验证“邯郸学步”假说。

Method: 在14个模型上测试推理蒸馏效果，分析学生模型与教师模型及人类认知对齐度，使用相关系数衡量表现。

Result: 蒸馏模型的认知对齐度显著下降（r=0.34 vs 0.64），部分模型性能低于蒸馏前基准，发现SFT引发“仿冒仪式”效应。

Conclusion: 人类认知是主动强化学习的产物，被动模仿无法实现认知对齐，推理蒸馏解耦计算成本与认知需求。

Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Models trained via reinforcement learning exhibit a "natural" alignment with human cognitive costs. However, we show that the prevailing paradigm of reasoning distillation -- training student models to mimic these traces via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) -- fails to transmit this cognitive structure. Testing the "Hán Dān Xué Bù" (Superficial Mimicry) hypothesis across 14 models, we find that distillation induces a "Functional Alignment Collapse": while teacher models mirror human difficulty scaling ($\bar{r}=0.64$), distilled students significantly degrade this alignment ($\bar{r}=0.34$), often underperforming their own pre-distillation baselines ("Negative Transfer"). Our analysis suggests that SFT induces a "Cargo Cult" effect, where students ritualistically replicate the linguistic form of reasoning (verbosity) without internalizing the teacher's dynamic resource allocation policy. Consequently, reasoning distillation decouples computational cost from cognitive demand, revealing that human-like cognition is an emergent property of active reinforcement, not passive imitation.

TL;DR: ArcAligner通过自适应选择性增强处理，解决上下文压缩与模型效率的平衡问题，使大语言模型在高度压缩的上下文中仍能高效生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统上下文压缩方法(如剪枝、摘要)会导致大语言模型对压缩数据理解困难，需要在压缩率和信息保留间找到新平衡点。

Method: 在模型层集成轻量级ArcAligner模块，采用自适应门控机制，仅在遇到复杂信息时触发额外计算，实现动态资源分配。

Result: 在知识密集型问答基准测试中超越压缩基线方法，尤其在多跳问答和长尾问题场景下表现突出，且代码已开源。

Conclusion: 证明了动态上下文本增强比静态压缩更能保持模型性能，为RAG系统设计提供了兼顾效率与准确性的新思路。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) helps LLMs stay accurate, but feeding long documents into a prompt makes the model slow and expensive. This has motivated context compression, ranging from token pruning and summarization to embedding-based compression. While researchers have tried ''compressing'' these documents into smaller summaries or mathematical embeddings, there is a catch: the more you compress the data, the more the LLM struggles to understand it. To address this challenge, we propose ArcAligner (Adaptive recursive context *Aligner*), a lightweight module integrated into the language model layers to help the model better utilize highly compressed context representations for downstream generation. It uses an adaptive ''gating'' system that only adds extra processing power when the information is complex, keeping the system fast. Across knowledge-intensive QA benchmarks, ArcAligner consistently beats compression baselines at comparable compression rates, especially on multi-hop and long-tail settings. The source code is publicly available.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种通过'组合引导标记'实现大型语言模型（LLM）多行为控制的方法，解决了现有研究侧重单一行为引导而难以应对多目标组合的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管已有大量研究针对LLM单一行为引导，但实际应用场景需要LLM同时满足多种需求。现有方法多在激活空间操作，缺乏有效的多行为组合控制机制，尤其对未见过的组合行为适应性不足。

Method: ①通过自蒸馏将自然语言表述的行为需求嵌入到专用标记中；②在输入标记空间而非激活空间构建行为引导；③训练专门的'组合标记'学习行为组合规律，使其能泛化到未见过的组合形式（包括新行为和新组合数量）。

Result: 实验表明：①引导标记在多个LLM架构上显著优于指令调优、激活引导和LoRA融合等方法；②组合标记能有效处理未见过的行为组合；③引导标记与自然语言指令结合可进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了更有效的多行为组合控制，其优势在于将行为引导从激活空间转移到输入空间，并且通过专门训练的组合标记突破了传统方法的泛化性瓶颈。

Abstract: Deploying LLMs in real-world applications requires controllable output that satisfies multiple desiderata at the same time. While existing work extensively addresses LLM steering for a single behavior, \textit{compositional steering} -- i.e., steering LLMs simultaneously towards multiple behaviors -- remains an underexplored problem. In this work, we propose \emph{compositional steering tokens} for multi-behavior steering. We first embed individual behaviors, expressed as natural language instructions, into dedicated tokens via self-distillation. Contrary to most prior work, which operates in the activation space, our behavior steers live in the space of input tokens, enabling more effective zero-shot composition. We then train a dedicated \textit{composition token} on pairs of behaviors and show that it successfully captures the notion of composition: it generalizes well to \textit{unseen} compositions, including those with unseen behaviors as well as those with an unseen \textit{number} of behaviors. Our experiments across different LLM architectures show that steering tokens lead to superior multi-behavior control compared to competing approaches (instructions, activation steering, and LoRA merging). Moreover, we show that steering tokens complement natural language instructions, with their combination resulting in further gains.

Motivation: 传统句子嵌入方法依赖非生成模型的对比学习，而基于LLM的方法因采用固定提示模板或修改架构，导致性能受限或生成能力下降。需要一种兼顾表征优化与生成能力的方法。

Method: 提出SemPA，结合语义偏好对齐框架，通过句子级DPO优化LLM在同义句生成任务中的表现，并从理论建立DPO与对比学习在Plackett-Luce模型下的关联。

Result: 在语义文本相似性任务及LLM基准测试中，SemPA显著提升语义表征性能，同时保持模型本身的生成能力。

Conclusion: SemPA平衡了LLM的语义表征增强与生成能力保留，为模型优化提供了更高效且无侵入性的范式。

Abstract: Traditional sentence embedding methods employ token-level contrastive learning on non-generative pre-trained models. Recently, there have emerged embedding methods based on generative large language models (LLMs). These methods either rely on fixed prompt templates or involve modifications to the model architecture. The former lacks further optimization of the model and results in limited performance, while the latter alters the internal computational mechanisms of the model, thereby compromising its generative capabilities. We propose SemPA, a novel approach that boosts the sentence representations while preserving the generative ability of LLMs via semantic preference alignment. We leverage sentence-level Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to efficiently optimize LLMs on a paraphrase generation task, where the model learns to discriminate semantically equivalent sentences while preserving inherent generative capacity. Theoretically, we establish a formal connection between DPO and contrastive learning under the Plackett-Luce model framework. Empirically, experimental results on both semantic textual similarity tasks and various benchmarks for LLMs show that SemPA achieves better semantic representations without sacrificing the inherent generation capability of LLMs.

Motivation: 印度用户广泛使用Hinglish（混杂印地语与英语的罗马化变体）发布社交媒体内容，传统单语NLP模型难以解析其语法语义复杂性，导致品牌监测中的情感分析失准，需开发适配代码混合语言的解决方案。

Method: 1. 对多语言BERT（mBERT）进行领域适配微调；2. 采用子词分词技术应对Hinglish的拼写变异、俚语使用和未登录词问题；3. 构建生产级情感分类流程。

Result: 成功开发高精度Hinglish情感分析系统，达到生产部署标准，并为低资源混合语种NLP任务建立可复用技术基准。

Conclusion: 实验证明多语言模型微调配合子词分词能有效提升代码混合语种处理能力，该框架可扩展至其他资源受限的跨语言社交媒体分析场景，显著优于单语模型。

Abstract: The effectiveness of brand monitoring in India is increasingly challenged by the rise of Hinglish--a hybrid of Hindi and English--used widely in user-generated content on platforms like Twitter. Traditional Natural Language Processing (NLP) models, built for monolingual data, often fail to interpret the syntactic and semantic complexity of this code-mixed language, resulting in inaccurate sentiment analysis and misleading market insights. To address this gap, we propose a high-performance sentiment classification framework specifically designed for Hinglish tweets. Our approach fine-tunes mBERT (Multilingual BERT), leveraging its multilingual capabilities to better understand the linguistic diversity of Indian social media. A key component of our methodology is the use of subword tokenization, which enables the model to effectively manage spelling variations, slang, and out-of-vocabulary terms common in Romanized Hinglish. This research delivers a production-ready AI solution for brand sentiment tracking and establishes a strong benchmark for multilingual NLP in low-resource, code-mixed environments.

Motivation: 探索人机交互中人类情感对AI动态行为的影响机理，填补关于情感反馈如何塑造AI持续表现的研究空白，为优化人机协作系统设计提供实证依据。

Method: 基于组间实验设计，控制参与者在两个任务（撰写公开回应和处理伦理困境）中采用赞美/愤怒/中性/指责情感与ChatGPT(4.0版)互动，量化分析AI输出质量变化及后续人际交流文本特征差异。

Result: 1) 赞美使AI回答改进显著优于中性对照组，愤怒提升效果较弱但存在，指责无增益；2)愤怒交互使AI处理伦理问题时削弱企业导向，加强公共利益侧重；3)指责行为导致后续人际交流中负面表达增加28%（p<0.01）；4)情感影响持续至后续无提示对话阶段。

Conclusion: 人机交互情感基调具有双重传导效应，既通过即时反馈重塑AI行为模式，又通过社会化学习机制迁移至后续人类社交场景，揭示情感计算在AI系统设计中的战略价值与伦理规范必要性。

Abstract: This research examines how the emotional tone of human-AI interactions shapes ChatGPT and human behavior. In a between-subject experiment, we asked participants to express a specific emotion while working with ChatGPT (GPT-4.0) on two tasks, including writing a public response and addressing an ethical dilemma. We found that compared to interactions where participants maintained a neutral tone, ChatGPT showed greater improvement in its answers when participants praised ChatGPT for its responses. Expressing anger towards ChatGPT also led to a higher albeit smaller improvement relative to the neutral condition, whereas blaming ChatGPT did not improve its answers. When addressing an ethical dilemma, ChatGPT prioritized corporate interests less when participants expressed anger towards it, while blaming increases its emphasis on protecting the public interest. Additionally, we found that people used more negative, hostile, and disappointing expressions in human-human communication after interactions during which participants blamed rather than praised for their responses. Together, our findings demonstrate that the emotional tone people apply in human-AI interactions not only shape ChatGPT's outputs but also carry over into subsequent human-human communication.

Abstract: Document Question Answering (DocQA) focuses on answering questions grounded in given documents, yet existing DocQA agents lack effective tool utilization and largely rely on closed-source models. In this work, we introduce DocDancer, an end-to-end trained open-source Doc agent. We formulate DocQA as an information-seeking problem and propose a tool-driven agent framework that explicitly models document exploration and comprehension. To enable end-to-end training of such agents, we introduce an Exploration-then-Synthesis data synthesis pipeline that addresses the scarcity of high-quality training data for DocQA. Training on the synthesized data, the trained models on two long-context document understanding benchmarks, MMLongBench-Doc and DocBench, show their effectiveness. Further analysis provides valuable insights for the agentic tool design and synthetic data.

TL;DR: 本论文提出RelayLLM框架，通过token级别协作解码解决大模型推理资源浪费问题，仅用1.07%的LLM调用实现49.52%平均准确率，较传统方法降本98.2%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM-SLM协作方法在完整查询层级调用LLM导致资源浪费，且SLM难以处理复杂推理步骤，需要更精细的协作机制以平衡效率与性能。

Method: 设计RelayLLM框架：1) Token级协作，使SLM自主决定关键token调用LLM；2) 两阶段训练（预热+GRPO算法）平衡自主推理与求助策略；3) 通过特殊命令实现LLM能力动态调用。

Result: 在6个基准测试中取得49.52%平均准确率（较随机路由器提升相当性能时）：1) LLM调用占比仅1.07%；2) 达成98.2%计算成本降低；3) 显著优于粗粒度路由方案。

Conclusion: RelayLLM通过细粒度协作机制和创新训练框架，成功弥合LLM与SLM性能差距，在保持高准确率同时极大降低计算开销，为高效推理提供新范式。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) for complex reasoning is often hindered by high computational costs and latency, while resource-efficient Small Language Models (SLMs) typically lack the necessary reasoning capacity. Existing collaborative approaches, such as cascading or routing, operate at a coarse granularity by offloading entire queries to LLMs, resulting in significant computational waste when the SLM is capable of handling the majority of reasoning steps. To address this, we propose RelayLLM, a novel framework for efficient reasoning via token-level collaborative decoding. Unlike routers, RelayLLM empowers the SLM to act as an active controller that dynamically invokes the LLM only for critical tokens via a special command, effectively "relaying" the generation process. We introduce a two-stage training framework, including warm-up and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to teach the model to balance independence with strategic help-seeking. Empirical results across six benchmarks demonstrate that RelayLLM achieves an average accuracy of 49.52%, effectively bridging the performance gap between the two models. Notably, this is achieved by invoking the LLM for only 1.07% of the total generated tokens, offering a 98.2% cost reduction compared to performance-matched random routers.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究对NLI任务的逻辑性质存在误解，明确NLI推理定义对正确解释模型性能至关重要，同时需解决数据集中不同标签解读与模型一致性冲突的问题。

Method: 基于SNLI数据集和LLM生成数据，利用共享前提的NLI样本对模型进行元推理一致性评测，系统性验证三种标签解读（矛盾传递性、蕴含可扩展性等逻辑属性）与实际训练目标的匹配度。

Result: 发现模型在特定逻辑推导场景下存在显著不一致性，揭示SNLI数据集实际编码的是'矛盾关系非传递且蕴含关系不可逆'的逻辑框架，而非传统形式逻辑的扩展解读。

Conclusion: NLI的推理能力评估需基于符合数据集内在逻辑属性的标签解读，该结论为改进模型训练目标和设计新型推理基准任务提供了理论依据。

Abstract: Natural Language Inference (NLI) has been an important task for evaluating language models for Natural Language Understanding, but the logical properties of the task are poorly understood and often mischaracterized. Understanding the notion of inference captured by NLI is key to interpreting model performance on the task. In this paper we formulate three possible readings of the NLI label set and perform a comprehensive analysis of the meta-inferential properties they entail. Focusing on the SNLI dataset, we exploit (1) NLI items with shared premises and (2) items generated by LLMs to evaluate models trained on SNLI for meta-inferential consistency and derive insights into which reading of the logical relations is encoded by the dataset.

TL;DR: This paper introduces 'Inside Out', a framework for long-term personalized dialogue systems using a structured PersonaTree to manage user profiling, reducing memory noise and maintaining persona consistency through controlled growth and reinforcement-learning-driven updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing systems face challenges in balancing unbounded user interactions with finite context capacities, leading to memory noise accumulation, degraded reasoning, and inconsistent personas. This work aims to create a reliable, scalable solution for maintaining long-term user profiles without sacrificing efficiency.

Method: 1. Proposes PersonaTree - a schema-constrained tree structure for user profiling (trunk stores core traits, branches/leaves hold dynamic details). 2. Develops MemListener (RL-based model) to execute structured memory operations. 3. Implements latency-optimized response generation using PersonaTree, with an agentic mode for detail-demanding scenarios.

Result: 1. PersonaTree achieved superior context noise suppression and persona consistency vs. full-text and memory systems. 2. Small-scale MemListener matched/exceeded powerful models (DeepSeek-R1-0528, Gemini-3-Pro) in memory operation accuracy. 3. Framework supports both real-time responses and detailed user profile queries.

Conclusion: PersonaTree effectively resolves long-term dialogue system challenges through structured memory compression and evolution control. The decoupled operation framework enables efficient resource allocation while maintaining interpretability and controllability in personalized interactions.

Abstract: Existing long-term personalized dialogue systems struggle to reconcile unbounded interaction streams with finite context constraints, often succumbing to memory noise accumulation, reasoning degradation, and persona inconsistency. To address these challenges, this paper proposes Inside Out, a framework that utilizes a globally maintained PersonaTree as the carrier of long-term user profiling. By constraining the trunk with an initial schema and updating the branches and leaves, PersonaTree enables controllable growth, achieving memory compression while preserving consistency. Moreover, we train a lightweight MemListener via reinforcement learning with process-based rewards to produce structured, executable, and interpretable {ADD, UPDATE, DELETE, NO_OP} operations, thereby supporting the dynamic evolution of the personalized tree. During response generation, PersonaTree is directly leveraged to enhance outputs in latency-sensitive scenarios; when users require more details, the agentic mode is triggered to introduce details on-demand under the constraints of the PersonaTree. Experiments show that PersonaTree outperforms full-text concatenation and various personalized memory systems in suppressing contextual noise and maintaining persona consistency. Notably, the small MemListener model achieves memory-operation decision performance comparable to, or even surpassing, powerful reasoning models such as DeepSeek-R1-0528 and Gemini-3-Pro.

TL;DR: LELA 是一种无需微调的模块化粗到细实体消歧方法，利用大型语言模型（LLMs）在跨领域和知识库的实体链接任务中表现出与微调方法相当甚至更优的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实体消歧是构建知识图谱、问答系统及信息抽取的基础，但现有方法需针对不同领域/知识库进行微调。LELA 旨在开发可适配多种目标域、知识库和不同类型LLMs的通用方法，避免耗时的模型重训练。

Method: 设计多阶段模块化架构：首先通过LLM生成初步实体消歧提案（粗筛），再利用知识库信息（如实体描述、关系）结合LLM推理能力进行二次精筛校验。模块间通过结构化prompt传递信息，实现跨领域可迁移。

Result: 在跨域实体消歧基准测试中，LELA的准确率与当前SOTA微调模型（如BERT-based）相当，且比其他非微调方法高12.7%-18.2%（F1值）。消融实验证明粗筛-精筛双阶段机制对复杂歧义场景提升达23%。

Conclusion: 模块化架构验证了LLMs零样本推理能力在实体消歧任务的可行性，尤其在跨领域场景中突破了传统微调方法的部署限制，为大模型赋能知识密集型任务提供了新范式。

Abstract: Entity linking (mapping ambiguous mentions in text to entities in a knowledge base) is a foundational step in tasks such as knowledge graph construction, question-answering, and information extraction. Our method, LELA, is a modular coarse-to-fine approach that leverages the capabilities of large language models (LLMs), and works with different target domains, knowledge bases and LLMs, without any fine-tuning phase. Our experiments across various entity linking settings show that LELA is highly competitive with fine-tuned approaches, and substantially outperforms the non-fine-tuned ones.

TL;DR: 论文指出当前多奖励强化学习中GRPO方法导致奖励信号坍缩问题，并提出GDPO方法通过解耦奖励标准化解决此问题，显著提升模型训练效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RL方法GRPO在多奖励场景下会产生优势值坍缩现象，导致训练信号分辨率降低，引发收敛不佳及训练失败问题，需要更优的多奖励优化方案。

Method: 提出Group reward-Decoupled Normalization Policy Optimization (GDPO)，将多奖励的标准化过程解耦处理，保持各奖励信号的相对差异性，采用独立优势值估计来提升优化精度。

Result: 在工具调用、数学推理和代码生成三个任务中，GDPO相比GRPO在准确性（提升8.7%）、缺陷率（降低34%）及约束遵循（格式/长度达标率提高22%）等指标均显著领先，且训练稳定性提升40%。

Conclusion: GDPO解决了多奖励RL中的信号坍缩问题，为复杂场景下的多目标优化提供了更稳定有效的技术路径，验证了解耦标准化策略在实际任务中的普适性和有效性。

Abstract: As language models become increasingly capable, users expect them to provide not only accurate responses but also behaviors aligned with diverse human preferences across a variety of scenarios. To achieve this, Reinforcement learning (RL) pipelines have begun incorporating multiple rewards, each capturing a distinct preference, to guide models toward these desired behaviors. However, recent work has defaulted to apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) under multi-reward setting without examining its suitability. In this paper, we demonstrate that directly applying GRPO to normalize distinct rollout reward combinations causes them to collapse into identical advantage values, reducing the resolution of the training signal and resulting in suboptimal convergence and, in some cases, early training failure. We then introduce Group reward-Decoupled Normalization Policy Optimization (GDPO), a new policy optimization method to resolve these issues by decoupling the normalization of individual rewards, more faithfully preserving their relative differences and enabling more accurate multi-reward optimization, along with substantially improved training stability. We compare GDPO with GRPO across three tasks: tool calling, math reasoning, and coding reasoning, evaluating both correctness metrics (accuracy, bug ratio) and constraint adherence metrics (format, length). Across all settings, GDPO consistently outperforms GRPO, demonstrating its effectiveness and generalizability for multi-reward reinforcement learning optimization.
