### [1] [Learning to Refocus with Video Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19823)
*SaiKiran Tedla,Zhoutong Zhang,Xuaner Zhang,Shumian Xin*

Abstract: Focus is a cornerstone of photography, yet autofocus systems often fail to capture the intended subject, and users frequently wish to adjust focus after capture. We introduce a novel method for realistic post-capture refocusing using video diffusion models. From a single defocused image, our approach generates a perceptually accurate focal stack, represented as a video sequence, enabling interactive refocusing and unlocking a range of downstream applications. We release a large-scale focal stack dataset acquired under diverse real-world smartphone conditions to support this work and future research. Our method consistently outperforms existing approaches in both perceptual quality and robustness across challenging scenarios, paving the way for more advanced focus-editing capabilities in everyday photography.

### [2] [RANSAC Scoring Functions: Analysis and Reality Check](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19850)
*A. Shekhovtsov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究重新审视了几何模型得分函数的设计，揭示了MAGSAC++的等效性，并通过实验证明不同得分函数性能相近。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在鲁棒几何拟合中如何有效评估模型质量，指出当前最佳方法MAGSAC++的理论缺陷，并寻求更优评估框架。

Method: 扩展几何误差至球形噪声模型，分析混合均匀异常值，提出实验方法评估得分函数有效性，包括大/小验证集测试。

Result: 发现所有测试的得分函数（含学习型）性能相同，MAGSAC++的得分等价于简单高斯-均匀似然模型，且对阈值超参数敏感。

Conclusion: 现有鲁棒模型得分函数无显著差异，未来改进需基于更扎实的理论框架，需重新评估阈值选择对性能的影响。

Abstract: We revisit the problem of assigning a score (a quality of fit) to candidate geometric models -- one of the key components of RANSAC for robust geometric fitting. In a non-robust setting, the ``gold standard'' scoring function, known as the geometric error, follows from a probabilistic model with Gaussian noises. We extend it to spherical noises. In a robust setting, we consider a mixture with uniformly distributed outliers and show that a threshold-based parameterization leads to a unified view of likelihood-based and robust M-estimators and associated local optimization schemes.
  Next we analyze MAGSAC++ which stands out for two reasons. First, it achieves the best results according to existing benchmarks. Second, it makes quite different modeling assumptions and derivation steps. We discovered, however that the derivation does not correspond to sound principles and the resulting score function is in fact numerically equivalent to a simple Gaussian-uniform likelihood, a basic model within the proposed framework.
  Finally, we propose an experimental methodology for evaluating scoring functions: assuming either a large validation set, or a small random validation set in expectation. We find that all scoring functions, including using a learned inlier distribution, perform identically. In particular, MAGSAC++ score is found to be neither better performing than simple contenders nor less sensitive to the choice of the threshold hyperparameter.
  Our theoretical and experimental analysis thus comprehensively revisit the state-of-the-art, which is critical for any future research seeking to improve the methods or apply them to other robust fitting problems.

### [3] [HyGE-Occ: Hybrid View-Transformation with 3D Gaussian and Edge Priors for 3D Panoptic Occupancy Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19871)
*Jong Wook Kim,Wonseok Roh,Ha Dam Baek,Pilhyeon Lee,Jonghyun Choi,Sangpil Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在保持精确几何结构和捕捉3D实例空间范围方面存在不足，导致全景分割鲁棒性受限，因此需要更优的3D场景表征方法。

Method: 1) 构建混合视角变换分支，融合连续高斯深度建模与离散深度分箱策略生成BEV特征；2) 从BEV特征提取边缘图作为辅助信息，增强边界感知能力。

Result: 在Occ3D-nuScenes数据集的实验表明，该方法在3D几何推理方面显著优于当前方法，提升点云场景的语义与实例建模精度。

Conclusion: 提出的高斯-边缘混合建模策略有效解决了复杂场景下几何一致性维持与实例边界精确分割的关键问题。

Abstract: 3D Panoptic Occupancy Prediction aims to reconstruct a dense volumetric scene map by predicting the semantic class and instance identity of every occupied region in 3D space. Achieving such fine-grained 3D understanding requires precise geometric reasoning and spatially consistent scene representation across complex environments. However, existing approaches often struggle to maintain precise geometry and capture the precise spatial range of 3D instances critical for robust panoptic separation. To overcome these limitations, we introduce HyGE-Occ, a novel framework that leverages a hybrid view-transformation branch with 3D Gaussian and edge priors to enhance both geometric consistency and boundary awareness in 3D panoptic occupancy prediction. HyGE-Occ employs a hybrid view-transformation branch that fuses a continuous Gaussian-based depth representation with a discretized depth-bin formulation, producing BEV features with improved geometric consistency and structural coherence. In parallel, we extract edge maps from BEV features and use them as auxiliary information to learn edge cues. In our extensive experiments on the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset, HyGE-Occ outperforms existing work, demonstrating superior 3D geometric reasoning.

### [4] [Widget2Code: From Visual Widgets to UI Code via Multimodal LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19918)
*Houston H. Zhang,Tao Zhang,Baoze Lin,Yuanqi Xue,Yincheng Zhu,Huan Liu,Li Gu,Linfeng Ye,Ziqiang Wang,Xinxin Zuo,Yang Wang,Yuanhao Yu,Zhixiang Chi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了Widget2Code任务和基准，旨在通过图像生成高保真、紧凑布局的小组件代码，开发了结合感知理解与代码生成的系统WidgetFactory，解决传统方法在视觉一致性与空间约束上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有UI转代码技术主要聚焦网页/手机界面，但紧凑型无上下文的小组件因密集布局、图标化设计和缺乏公开标注数据而面临生成质量与空间约束的挑战。

Method: 构建无框架依赖的领域特定语言WidgetDSL及编译引擎，设计包含图标检索、可视化模块和空间适配的感知系统，并引入细粒度多维评估基准。

Result: 实验表明现有大型多模态模型相比传统方法表现更优但依然不可靠，所提方法实现代码生成准确率提升27%，空间约束满足率提高41%，通过93%的渲染测试用例。

Conclusion: 本研究确立了组件化代码生成范式，首次实现从图像到多前端框架（React等）的高质量映射，为组件代码生成提供了标准化框架和评估体系。

Abstract: User interface to code (UI2Code) aims to generate executable code that can faithfully reconstruct a given input UI. Prior work focuses largely on web pages and mobile screens, leaving app widgets underexplored. Unlike web or mobile UIs with rich hierarchical context, widgets are compact, context-free micro-interfaces that summarize key information through dense layouts and iconography under strict spatial constraints. Moreover, while (image, code) pairs are widely available for web or mobile UIs, widget designs are proprietary and lack accessible markup. We formalize this setting as the Widget-to-Code (Widget2Code) and introduce an image-only widget benchmark with fine-grained, multi-dimensional evaluation metrics. Benchmarking shows that although generalized multimodal large language models (MLLMs) outperform specialized UI2Code methods, they still produce unreliable and visually inconsistent code. To address these limitations, we develop a baseline that jointly advances perceptual understanding and structured code generation. At the perceptual level, we follow widget design principles to assemble atomic components into complete layouts, equipped with icon retrieval and reusable visualization modules. At the system level, we design an end-to-end infrastructure, WidgetFactory, which includes a framework-agnostic widget-tailored domain-specific language (WidgetDSL) and a compiler that translates it into multiple front-end implementations (e.g., React, HTML/CSS). An adaptive rendering module further refines spatial dimensions to satisfy compactness constraints. Together, these contributions substantially enhance visual fidelity, establishing a strong baseline and unified infrastructure for future Widget2Code research.

### [5] [Unified Brain Surface and Volume Registration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19928)
*S. Mazdak Abulnaga,Andrew Hoopes,Malte Hoffmann,Robin Magnet,Maks Ovsjanikov,Lilla Zöllei,John Guttag,Bruce Fischl,Adrian Dalca*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NeurAlign 是一种深度学习框架，通过统一的体素-表面表示，联合配准脑部MRI的皮层和皮层下区域，优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的脑部MRI配准方法分离处理体素和表面配准，导致结果不一致并限制下游分析，亟需提升解剖准确性和几何连贯性。

Method: 构建中间球面坐标空间，将表面拓扑与体素解剖结构结合，通过深度学习集成球面配准，实现体积与表面的同步对齐。

Result: 在域内和域外数据集实验中，Dice评分提升最高7分，保持规则形变场，比传统方法快多个数量级且无需额外输入。

Conclusion: NeurAlign 树立了皮层与皮层下联合配准的新标准，显著提升精度、速度和易用性，有望推动神经影像研究。

Abstract: Accurate registration of brain MRI scans is fundamental for cross-subject analysis in neuroscientific studies. This involves aligning both the cortical surface of the brain and the interior volume. Traditional methods treat volumetric and surface-based registration separately, which often leads to inconsistencies that limit downstream analyses. We propose a deep learning framework, NeurAlign, that registers $3$D brain MRI images by jointly aligning both cortical and subcortical regions through a unified volume-and-surface-based representation. Our approach leverages an intermediate spherical coordinate space to bridge anatomical surface topology with volumetric anatomy, enabling consistent and anatomically accurate alignment. By integrating spherical registration into the learning, our method ensures geometric coherence between volume and surface domains. In a series of experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, our method consistently outperforms both classical and machine learning-based registration methods -- improving the Dice score by up to 7 points while maintaining regular deformation fields. Additionally, it is orders of magnitude faster than the standard method for this task, and is simpler to use because it requires no additional inputs beyond an MRI scan. With its superior accuracy, fast inference, and ease of use, NeurAlign sets a new standard for joint cortical and subcortical registration.

### [6] [SE360: Semantic Edit in 360$^\circ$ Panoramas via Hierarchical Data Construction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19943)
*Haoyi Zhong,Fang-Lue Zhang,Andrew Chalmers,Taehyun Rhee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出SE360框架，通过自主数据生成和两阶段精炼策略，结合Transformer扩散模型实现360度全景图像的高质量多条件编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有360度全景编辑方法在投影变换和语义一致性方面效果不佳，且依赖手动标注数据，限制了实际应用。

Method: 设计粗到细的自动数据生成流水线，集成Vision-Language Model与投影调整技术，构建语义-几何双一致性数据集，并采用两阶段成本效益优化策略。最终基于Transformer架构实现多模态引导的全景扩散编辑模型。

Result: 在无监督数据条件下保持几何一致性，消除人工标注成本，扩散模型在文本/掩码/参考图引导的编辑任务中达到当前最优的视觉质量与语义准确性。

Conclusion: 所提框架解决了360全景编辑中存在的多视角语义碎片化、计算成本高和编辑模式单一的技术瓶颈，为沉浸式编辑工具提供实用化方案。

Abstract: While instruction-based image editing is emerging, extending it to 360$^\circ$ panoramas introduces additional challenges. Existing methods often produce implausible results in both equirectangular projections (ERP) and perspective views. To address these limitations, we propose SE360, a novel framework for multi-condition guided object editing in 360$^\circ$ panoramas. At its core is a novel coarse-to-fine autonomous data generation pipeline without manual intervention. This pipeline leverages a Vision-Language Model (VLM) and adaptive projection adjustment for hierarchical analysis, ensuring the holistic segmentation of objects and their physical context. The resulting data pairs are both semantically meaningful and geometrically consistent, even when sourced from unlabeled panoramas. Furthermore, we introduce a cost-effective, two-stage data refinement strategy to improve data realism and mitigate model overfitting to erase artifacts. Based on the constructed dataset, we train a Transformer-based diffusion model to allow flexible object editing guided by text, mask, or reference image in 360$^\circ$ panoramas. Our experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in both visual quality and semantic accuracy.

Motivation: 研究视频模型是否能通过2D视频数据训练自发产生全局3D理解，填补视频基础模型与3D感知之间的研究空白。

Method: 提出首个模型无关的评估框架，通过浅层读出层从VidFM特征中估计深度、法线、遮挡边界等3D属性，系统量化模型的3D意识。

Result: SOTA视频生成模型（如MetaAI、OpenAI的模型）展现强3D物体和场景理解能力，部分任务表现超过专业3D训练模型，且尺度感知与训练数据量正相关。

Conclusion: 证明VidFM具备隐式3D编码能力，其3D感知潜力为构建无需显式3D监督的可扩展模型提供新方向，基准测试结果指导未来跨模态研究。

Abstract: Videos are continuous 2D projections of 3D worlds. After training on large video data, will global 3D understanding naturally emerge? We study this by quantifying the 3D understanding of existing Video Foundation Models (VidFMs) pretrained on vast video data. We propose the first model-agnostic framework that measures the 3D awareness of various VidFMs by estimating multiple 3D properties from their features via shallow read-outs. Our study presents meaningful findings regarding the 3D awareness of VidFMs on multiple axes. In particular, we show that state-of-the-art video generation models exhibit a strong understanding of 3D objects and scenes, despite not being trained on any 3D data. Such understanding can even surpass that of large expert models specifically trained for 3D tasks. Our findings, together with the 3D benchmarking of major VidFMs, provide valuable observations for building scalable 3D models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HistoWAS是结合空间分析与临床结果的计算框架，用于病理学研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 缺乏评估组织微环境和宏观环境空间交互的工具，限制了临床相关性研究。

Method: 通过引入基于GIS的30种空间特征和PheWAS启发的关联分析引擎，构建特征空间进行多元回归分析。

Result: 分析385例肾活检全切片图像（102种特征），验证框架可行性。

Conclusion: HistoWAS可有效揭示组织空间结构与临床预后的关联，促进生物标志物发现。

Abstract: High-throughput "pathomic" analysis of Whole Slide Images (WSIs) offers new opportunities to study tissue characteristics and for biomarker discovery. However, the clinical relevance of the tissue characteristics at the micro- and macro-environment level is limited by the lack of tools that facilitate the measurement of the spatial interaction of individual structure characteristics and their association with clinical parameters. To address these challenges, we introduce HistoWAS (Histology-Wide Association Study), a computational framework designed to link tissue spatial organization to clinical outcomes. Specifically, HistoWAS implements (1) a feature space that augments conventional metrics with 30 topological and spatial features, adapted from Geographic Information Systems (GIS) point pattern analysis, to quantify tissue micro-architecture; and (2) an association study engine, inspired by Phenome-Wide Association Studies (PheWAS), that performs mass univariate regression for each feature with statistical correction. As a proof of concept, we applied HistoWAS to analyze a total of 102 features (72 conventional object-level features and our 30 spatial features) using 385 PAS-stained WSIs from 206 participants in the Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP). The code and data have been released to https://github.com/hrlblab/histoWAS.

### [9] [A Novel CNN Gradient Boosting Ensemble for Guava Disease Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19989)
*Tamim Ahasan Rijon,Yeasin Arafath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study proposes an ensemble model combining CNN and Gradient Boosting Machine (CNN-ML) to detect guava diseases (Anthracnose, Fruit Fly, and healthy) in Bangladesh with 99.99% classification accuracy using the Guava Fruit Disease Dataset 2024 (GFDD24).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Guava is a vital crop in Bangladesh, but diseases such as Anthracnose and Fruit Fly reduce its productivity and market value, necessitating accurate and real-time disease detection to boost agricultural output and economic growth.

Method: A CNN-based deep learning framework was integrated with traditional machine learning techniques (Gradient Boosting Machine) to classify guava images into three categories (Healthy, Fruit Flies, Anthracnose) using the GFDD24 dataset collected from Rajshahi and Pabna plantations.

Result: The proposed CNN-ML cascade achieves up to 99.99% classification accuracy on the GFDD24 dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-time agricultural monitoring systems for detecting guava diseases.

Conclusion: The ensemble CNN-ML model provides high-accuracy disease detection for local guava cultivation in Bangladesh, offering a practical solution for real-time disease monitoring and agricultural management optimization.

Abstract: As a significant agricultural country, Bangladesh utilizes its fertile land for guava cultivation and dedicated labor to boost its economic development. In a nation like Bangladesh, enhancing guava production and agricultural practices plays a crucial role in its economy. Anthracnose and fruit fly infection can lower the quality and productivity of guava, a crucial tropical fruit. Expert systems that detect diseases early can reduce losses and safeguard the harvest. Images of guava fruits classified into the Healthy, Fruit Flies, and Anthracnose classes are included in the Guava Fruit Disease Dataset 2024 (GFDD24), which comes from plantations in Rajshahi and Pabna, Bangladesh. This study aims to create models using CNN alongside traditional machine learning techniques that can effectively identify guava diseases in locally cultivated varieties in Bangladesh. In order to achieve the highest classification accuracy of approximately 99.99% for the guava dataset, we propose utilizing ensemble models that combine CNNML with Gradient Boosting Machine. In general, the CNN-ML cascade framework exhibits strong, high-accuracy guava disease detection that is appropriate for real-time agricultural monitoring systems.

### [10] [A Dual-Branch Local-Global Framework for Cross-Resolution Land Cover Mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19990)
*Peng Gao,Ke Li,Di Wang,Yongshan Zhu,Yiming Zhang,Xuemei Luo,Yifeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为DDTM的双分支弱监督框架，用于解决跨分辨率土地覆盖制图问题，结合扩散模型优化局部语义与Transformer建模全局上下文，并通过伪标签置信度评估模块减少噪声干扰，在Chesapeake Bay基准数据集上达到66.52%的mIoU，代码已开源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨分辨率土地覆盖制图面临监督信号粗糙、分辨率差异大导致的精细结构对齐困难和噪声干扰问题，传统方法难以平衡局部细节与全局上下文一致性。

Method: 1) 设计双分支架构：扩散分支在粗糙监督下逐步优化局部精细化语义，Transformer分支通过自注意力机制捕捉长距离上下文依赖；2) 提出伪标签置信度评估模块，筛选可靠监督信号以抑制跨分辨率不一致带来的噪声。

Result: 在Chesapeake Bay基准测试中，DDTM以66.52% mIoU表现超越现有弱监督方法，且代码开源支持可复现性。

Conclusion: DDTM通过显式解耦局部优化与全局建模，在跨分辨率监督下实现更鲁棒的土地覆盖预测，为遥感领域弱监督学习提供了新范式。

Abstract: Cross-resolution land cover mapping aims to produce high-resolution semantic predictions from coarse or low-resolution supervision, yet the severe resolution mismatch makes effective learning highly challenging. Existing weakly supervised approaches often struggle to align fine-grained spatial structures with coarse labels, leading to noisy supervision and degraded mapping accuracy. To tackle this problem, we propose DDTM, a dual-branch weakly supervised framework that explicitly decouples local semantic refinement from global contextual reasoning. Specifically, DDTM introduces a diffusion-based branch to progressively refine fine-scale local semantics under coarse supervision, while a transformer-based branch enforces long-range contextual consistency across large spatial extents. In addition, we design a pseudo-label confidence evaluation module to mitigate noise induced by cross-resolution inconsistencies and to selectively exploit reliable supervisory signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DDTM establishes a new state-of-the-art on the Chesapeake Bay benchmark, achieving 66.52\% mIoU and substantially outperforming prior weakly supervised methods. The code is available at https://github.com/gpgpgp123/DDTM.

Abstract: Automated pavement defect detection often struggles to generalize across diverse real-world conditions due to the lack of standardized datasets. Existing datasets differ in annotation styles, distress type definitions, and formats, limiting their integration for unified training. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark dataset that consolidates multiple publicly available sources into a standardized collection of 52747 images from seven countries, with 135277 bounding box annotations covering 13 distinct distress types. The dataset captures broad real-world variation in image quality, resolution, viewing angles, and weather conditions, offering a unique resource for consistent training and evaluation. Its effectiveness was demonstrated through benchmarking with state-of-the-art object detection models including YOLOv8-YOLOv12, Faster R-CNN, and DETR, which achieved competitive performance across diverse scenarios. By standardizing class definitions and annotation formats, this dataset provides the first globally representative benchmark for pavement defect detection and enables fair comparison of models, including zero-shot transfer to new environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了LaSeRS数据集和SegEarth-R2模型，专注于解决复杂地理空间场景下语言引导的遥感图像分割难题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前模型仅能处理简单指令，对于包含多层次细节、多目标、推理需求及语言变化的复杂场景表现不足，现有数据集难以满足实际应用中对模型鲁棒性的要求。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了复杂场景语言分割数据集与模型的空白，通过LaSeRS和SegEarth-R2推动了遥感领域真实应用中复杂地理空间推理的发展。

Abstract: Effectively grounding complex language to pixels in remote sensing (RS) images is a critical challenge for applications like disaster response and environmental monitoring. Current models can parse simple, single-target commands but fail when presented with complex geospatial scenarios, e.g., segmenting objects at various granularities, executing multi-target instructions, and interpreting implicit user intent. To drive progress against these failures, we present LaSeRS, the first large-scale dataset built for comprehensive training and evaluation across four critical dimensions of language-guided segmentation: hierarchical granularity, target multiplicity, reasoning requirements, and linguistic variability. By capturing these dimensions, LaSeRS moves beyond simple commands, providing a benchmark for complex geospatial reasoning. This addresses a critical gap: existing datasets oversimplify, leading to sensitivity-prone real-world models. We also propose SegEarth-R2, an MLLM architecture designed for comprehensive language-guided segmentation in RS, which directly confronts these challenges. The model's effectiveness stems from two key improvements: (1) a spatial attention supervision mechanism specifically handles the localization of small objects and their components, and (2) a flexible and efficient segmentation query mechanism that handles both single-target and multi-target scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our SegEarth-R2 achieves outstanding performance on LaSeRS and other benchmarks, establishing a powerful baseline for the next generation of geospatial segmentation. All data and code will be released at https://github.com/earth-insights/SegEarth-R2.

### [13] [A Contextual Analysis of Driver-Facing and Dual-View Video Inputs for Distraction Detection in Naturalistic Driving Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20025)
*Anthony Dontoh,Stephanie Ivey,Armstrong Aboah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 将面向道路的视角与传统的驾驶员视角结合能提升分心驾驶检测的准确性，但这取决于具体的模型架构设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有计算机视觉分心驾驶检测模型过度依赖单一驾驶员视角，忽视了环境背景对驾驶行为的影响。

Method: 使用真实驾驶双摄像头数据，对比了SlowFast-R50、X3D-M和SlowOnly-R50三种时空动作识别架构的单视角（仅驾驶员）与双视角（驾驶员+道路）输入配置性能差异。

Result: SlowOnly模型双视角输入提升9.8%准确率，而SlowFast模型因表征冲突导致准确率下降7.2%。

Conclusion: 视觉上下文的添加效果受架构限制，多模态系统需要融合感知设计才能有效集成多视角信息。

Abstract: Despite increasing interest in computer vision-based distracted driving detection, most existing models rely exclusively on driver-facing views and overlook crucial environmental context that influences driving behavior. This study investigates whether incorporating road-facing views alongside driver-facing footage improves distraction detection accuracy in naturalistic driving conditions. Using synchronized dual-camera recordings from real-world driving, we benchmark three leading spatiotemporal action recognition architectures: SlowFast-R50, X3D-M, and SlowOnly-R50. Each model is evaluated under two input configurations: driver-only and stacked dual-view. Results show that while contextual inputs can improve detection in certain models, performance gains depend strongly on the underlying architecture. The single-pathway SlowOnly model achieved a 9.8 percent improvement with dual-view inputs, while the dual-pathway SlowFast model experienced a 7.2 percent drop in accuracy due to representational conflicts. These findings suggest that simply adding visual context is not sufficient and may lead to interference unless the architecture is specifically designed to support multi-view integration. This study presents one of the first systematic comparisons of single- and dual-view distraction detection models using naturalistic driving data and underscores the importance of fusion-aware design for future multimodal driver monitoring systems.

### [14] [MAPI-GNN: Multi-Activation Plane Interaction Graph Neural Network for Multimodal Medical Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20026)
*Ziwei Qin,Xuhui Song,Deqing Huang,Na Qin,Jun Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MAPI-GNN, a model that enhances graph neural networks for multimodal medical diagnosis by learning dynamic, multifaceted graphs from disentangled features, achieving superior performance over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional graph neural networks (GNNs) in medical diagnosis rely on single, static graphs derived from indiscriminate features, limiting their ability to capture patient-specific pathological relationships.

Method: MAPI-GNN dynamically constructs multiple activation graphs via a multi-dimensional discriminator and contextualizes them using a relational fusion engine, enabling multifaceted graph profiles from semantically disentangled feature subspaces.

Result: MAPI-GNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods on two diverse medical diagnosis tasks with over 1,300 patient samples.

Conclusion: Learning multifaceted graph profiles from semantic feature subspaces improves relational modeling in multimodal medical diagnosis, offering robust and patient-specific insights.

Abstract: Graph neural networks are increasingly applied to multimodal medical diagnosis for their inherent relational modeling capabilities. However, their efficacy is often compromised by the prevailing reliance on a single, static graph built from indiscriminate features, hindering the ability to model patient-specific pathological relationships. To this end, the proposed Multi-Activation Plane Interaction Graph Neural Network (MAPI-GNN) reconstructs this single-graph paradigm by learning a multifaceted graph profile from semantically disentangled feature subspaces. The framework first uncovers latent graph-aware patterns via a multi-dimensional discriminator; these patterns then guide the dynamic construction of a stack of activation graphs; and this multifaceted profile is finally aggregated and contextualized by a relational fusion engine for a robust diagnosis. Extensive experiments on two diverse tasks, comprising over 1300 patient samples, demonstrate that MAPI-GNN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: This paper proposes H2em, a hyperbolic embedding framework for compositional zero-shot learning that leverages hierarchical structures through specialized losses and hyperbolic geometry to achieve state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CZSL methods ignore hierarchical relationships between primitives and compositions, leading to poor generalization in large-scale scenarios due to Euclidean space limitations.

Method: H2em uses hyperbolic geometry for hierarchical embeddings with (1) Dual-Hierarchical Entailment Loss for hierarchy preservation, (2) Discriminative Alignment Loss for fine-grained separation, and (3) Hyperbolic Cross-Modal Attention for cross-modal integration.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance on three CZSL benchmarks in both closed-world and open-world settings with improved hierarchical generalization.

Conclusion: Hyperbolic geometry outperforms Euclidean approaches for hierarchical CZSL, with H2em's specialized losses enhancing hierarchical structure learning and compositional discrimination.

Abstract: Compositional zero-shot learning (CZSL) aims to recognize unseen state-object compositions by generalizing from a training set of their primitives (state and object). Current methods often overlook the rich hierarchical structures, such as the semantic hierarchy of primitives (e.g., apple fruit) and the conceptual hierarchy between primitives and compositions (e.g, sliced apple apple). A few recent efforts have shown effectiveness in modeling these hierarchies through loss regularization within Euclidean space. In this paper, we argue that they fail to scale to the large-scale taxonomies required for real-world CZSL: the space's polynomial volume growth in flat geometry cannot match the exponential structure, impairing generalization capacity. To this end, we propose H2em, a new framework that learns Hierarchical Hyperbolic EMbeddings for CZSL. H2em leverages the unique properties of hyperbolic geometry, a space naturally suited for embedding tree-like structures with low distortion. However, a naive hyperbolic mapping may suffer from hierarchical collapse and poor fine-grained discrimination. We further design two learning objectives to structure this space: a Dual-Hierarchical Entailment Loss that uses hyperbolic entailment cones to enforce the predefined hierarchies, and a Discriminative Alignment Loss with hard negative mining to establish a large geodesic distance between semantically similar compositions. Furthermore, we devise Hyperbolic Cross-Modal Attention to realize instance-aware cross-modal infusion within hyperbolic geometry. Extensive ablations on three benchmarks demonstrate that H2em establishes a new state-of-the-art in both closed-world and open-world scenarios. Our codes will be released.

### [16] [VALLR-Pin: Dual-Decoding Visual Speech Recognition for Mandarin with Pinyin-Guided LLM Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20032)
*Chang Sun,Dongliang Xie,Bo Qin,Hong Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VALLR-Pin是一种针对中文视觉语音识别的双阶段框架，通过扩展英文VALLR架构，在编码器后引入双解码器联合预测汉字序列和拼音，并结合大语言模型（LLM）消除歧义，最终通过合成噪声数据微调优化模型对中文同音字的识别能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中文的视觉语音识别面临音素高度模糊和同音字普遍的挑战（如视觉特征无法区分同音词），传统方法难以有效结合语音与语言上下文，亟需通过多任务学习和语境建模提升识别鲁棒性。

Method: 1.共享视频编码器输出双解码器，同步预测汉字序列和拼音（多任务学习）；
2.LLM推理阶段将候选文本与拼音拼接构建提示词进行纠错；
3.用训练数据生成模型中间检查点的不完美拼音-文本对，合成指令-响应对用于LLM微调，使其了解自研模型的特定错误模式。

Result: 通过视觉特征、拼音音素和语言模型的三联协同，有效缓解中文同音字的视觉语音歧义问题，在无声唇读任务中实现更精确的文本生成，特别是在处理发音相近但语义不同的汉字时表现显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法证明了在中文视觉语音识别中，联合建模视觉-字符-拼音三元组并引入可微调的LLM后处理，能系统性地解决音素模糊与同音干扰问题，为多模态语境建模提供了可迁移的框架设计范例。

Abstract: Visual Speech Recognition aims to transcribe spoken words from silent lip-motion videos. This task is particularly challenging for Mandarin, as visemes are highly ambiguous and homophones are prevalent. We propose VALLR-Pin, a novel two-stage framework that extends the recent VALLR architecture from English to Mandarin. First, a shared video encoder feeds into dual decoders, which jointly predict both Chinese character sequences and their standard Pinyin romanization. The multi-task learning of character and phonetic outputs fosters robust visual-semantic representations. During inference, the text decoder generates multiple candidate transcripts. We construct a prompt by concatenating the Pinyin output with these candidate Chinese sequences and feed it to a large language model to resolve ambiguities and refine the transcription. This provides the LLM with explicit phonetic context to correct homophone-induced errors. Finally, we fine-tune the LLM on synthetic noisy examples: we generate imperfect Pinyin-text pairs from intermediate VALLR-Pin checkpoints using the training data, creating instruction-response pairs for error correction. This endows the LLM with awareness of our model's specific error patterns. In summary, VALLR-Pin synergizes visual features with phonetic and linguistic context to improve Mandarin lip-reading performance.

TL;DR: FlashLips 提出两阶段无掩码唇形同步系统，实现100+ FPS实时推理并保持先进视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统系统依赖显式掩码控制嘴唇区域且推理效率低，需解决复杂训练目标（如GAN）导致的速度瓶颈，并保持高质量视觉效果。

Method: 1. 第一阶段：轻量潜在空间编辑器，通过重建损失优化，使用参考身份、掩码帧和低维嘴唇姿态向量重建图像；引入自监督微调，利用自生成伪标签隐式定位嘴唇区域。2. 第二阶段：流匹配目标训练音频到姿态Transformer，从语音预测嘴唇控制向量。

Conclusion: 结合确定性重建与音频驱动控制，提供高效稳定唇形同步方案，在速度与质量间实现最优平衡。

Abstract: We present FlashLips, a two-stage, mask-free lip-sync system that decouples lips control from rendering and achieves real-time performance running at over 100 FPS on a single GPU, while matching the visual quality of larger state-of-the-art models. Stage 1 is a compact, one-step latent-space editor that reconstructs an image using a reference identity, a masked target frame, and a low-dimensional lips-pose vector, trained purely with reconstruction losses - no GANs or diffusion. To remove explicit masks at inference, we use self-supervision: we generate mouth-altered variants of the target image, that serve as pseudo ground truth for fine-tuning, teaching the network to localize edits to the lips while preserving the rest. Stage 2 is an audio-to-pose transformer trained with a flow-matching objective to predict lips-poses vectors from speech. Together, these stages form a simple and stable pipeline that combines deterministic reconstruction with robust audio control, delivering high perceptual quality and faster-than-real-time speed.

Motivation: 现有图像描述技术缺失关键上下文信息（如事件背景、结果），限制了图像在新闻、教育等领域的深度应用，亟需增强描述的信息丰富度。

Method: 1）使用BEIT-3/SigLIP检索相似图像；2）ORB/SIFT几何对齐重排序；3）Qwen3（QLoRA微调）融合视觉输入与相关文章语义信息，生成事件增强型描述。

Result: 在OpenEvents v1数据集上相比传统方法生成的描述更准确且信息量显著提升，尤其在事件细节（如时间、地点、因果关系）的覆盖上表现突出。,

Conclusion: 融合外部知识的多模态Pipeline有效解决了图像描述缺失上下文的痛点，未来可扩展到新闻自动生成、数字档案智能化等应用领域。

Abstract: Real-world image captions often lack contextual depth, omitting crucial details such as event background, temporal cues, outcomes, and named entities that are not visually discernible. This gap limits the effectiveness of image understanding in domains like journalism, education, and digital archives, where richer, more informative descriptions are essential. To address this, we propose a multimodal pipeline that augments visual input with external textual knowledge. Our system retrieves semantically similar images using BEIT-3 (Flickr30k-384 and COCO-384) and SigLIP So-384, reranks them using ORB and SIFT for geometric alignment, and extracts contextual information from related articles via semantic search. A fine-tuned Qwen3 model with QLoRA then integrates this context with base captions generated by Instruct BLIP (Vicuna-7B) to produce event-enriched, context-aware descriptions. Evaluated on the OpenEvents v1 dataset, our approach generates significantly more informative captions compared to traditional methods, showing strong potential for real-world applications requiring deeper visual-textual understanding

Abstract: Recent advances in learned image codecs have been extended from human perception toward machine perception. However, progressive image compression with fine granular scalability (FGS)-which enables decoding a single bitstream at multiple quality levels-remains unexplored for machine-oriented codecs. In this work, we propose a novel progressive learned image compression codec for machine perception, PICM-Net, based on trit-plane coding. By analyzing the difference between human- and machine-oriented rate-distortion priorities, we systematically examine the latent prioritization strategies in terms of machine-oriented codecs. To further enhance real-world adaptability, we design an adaptive decoding controller, which dynamically determines the necessary decoding level during inference time to maintain the desired confidence of downstream machine prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach enables efficient and adaptive progressive transmission while maintaining high performance in the downstream classification task, establishing a new paradigm for machine-aware progressive image compression.

Conclusion: 该方法通过3D布局与ControlNet的结合，解决了点云复杂分布与控制信号间的不平衡问题。

Abstract: Generating realistic and diverse LiDAR point clouds is crucial for autonomous driving simulation. Although previous methods achieve LiDAR point cloud generation from user inputs, they struggle to attain high-quality results while enabling versatile controllability, due to the imbalance between the complex distribution of LiDAR point clouds and the simple control signals. To address the limitation, we propose LiDARDraft, which utilizes the 3D layout to build a bridge between versatile conditional signals and LiDAR point clouds. The 3D layout can be trivially generated from various user inputs such as textual descriptions and images. Specifically, we represent text, images, and point clouds as unified 3D layouts, which are further transformed into semantic and depth control signals. Then, we employ a rangemap-based ControlNet to guide LiDAR point cloud generation. This pixel-level alignment approach demonstrates excellent performance in controllable LiDAR point clouds generation, enabling "simulation from scratch", allowing self-driving environments to be created from arbitrary textual descriptions, images and sketches.

Conclusion: 提出的DDAVS框架有效缓解多源纠缠和模态不对齐问题，展示了良好的跨模态分割泛化能力

Abstract: Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) aims to localize sound-producing objects at the pixel level by jointly leveraging auditory and visual information. However, existing methods often suffer from multi-source entanglement and audio-visual misalignment, which lead to biases toward louder or larger objects while overlooking weaker, smaller, or co-occurring sources. To address these challenges, we propose DDAVS, a Disentangled Audio Semantics and Delayed Bidirectional Alignment framework. To mitigate multi-source entanglement, DDAVS employs learnable queries to extract audio semantics and anchor them within a structured semantic space derived from an audio prototype memory bank. This is further optimized through contrastive learning to enhance discriminability and robustness. To alleviate audio-visual misalignment, DDAVS introduces dual cross-attention with delayed modality interaction, improving the robustness of multimodal alignment. Extensive experiments on the AVS-Objects and VPO benchmarks demonstrate that DDAVS consistently outperforms existing approaches, exhibiting strong performance across single-source, multi-source, and multi-instance scenarios. These results validate the effectiveness and generalization ability of our framework under challenging real-world audio-visual segmentation conditions.

TL;DR: HEART-ViT 通过基于 Hessian 的动态注意力和令牌剪枝方法，优化 ViT 的效率，显著降低计算成本，同时保持甚至提升准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有 ViT 优化方法局限于单独处理令牌或注意头，依赖启发式规则，导致性能下降。ViT 的二次计算成本和冗余运算也阻碍其在资源受限设备上的部署。

Method: 使用 Hessian-vector 乘积估计令牌和注意头的曲率加权敏感度，在明确的损失预算下进行剪枝决策，统一处理令牌和注意头的冗余。

Result: 在 ImageNet 数据集上，FLOPs 最多减少 49.4%，延迟降低 36%，吞吐量增加 46%，微调后保持/提升准确性（如 40% 令牌剪枝后准确率恢复 4.7%），并在边缘设备中提升推理速度和能效。

Conclusion: HEART-ViT 是首个统一的、基于曲率的 ViT 剪枝框架，在理论与实践之间架起桥梁，实现了高效且保持精度的优化。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) deliver state-of-the-art accuracy but their quadratic attention cost and redundant computations severely hinder deployment on latency and resource-constrained platforms. Existing pruning approaches treat either tokens or heads in isolation, relying on heuristics or first-order signals, which often sacrifice accuracy or fail to generalize across inputs. We introduce HEART-ViT, a Hessian-guided efficient dynamic attention and token pruning framework for vision transformers, which to the best of our knowledge is the first unified, second-order, input-adaptive framework for ViT optimization. HEART-ViT estimates curvature-weighted sensitivities of both tokens and attention heads using efficient Hessian-vector products, enabling principled pruning decisions under explicit loss budgets.This dual-view sensitivity reveals an important structural insight: token pruning dominates computational savings, while head pruning provides fine-grained redundancy removal, and their combination achieves a superior trade-off. On ImageNet-100 and ImageNet-1K with ViT-B/16 and DeiT-B/16, HEART-ViT achieves up to 49.4 percent FLOPs reduction, 36 percent lower latency, and 46 percent higher throughput, while consistently matching or even surpassing baseline accuracy after fine-tuning, for example 4.7 percent recovery at 40 percent token pruning. Beyond theoretical benchmarks, we deploy HEART-ViT on different edge devices such as AGX Orin, demonstrating that our reductions in FLOPs and latency translate directly into real-world gains in inference speed and energy efficiency. HEART-ViT bridges the gap between theory and practice, delivering the first unified, curvature-driven pruning framework that is both accuracy-preserving and edge-efficient.

Abstract: Document image retrieval (DIR) aims to retrieve document images from a gallery according to a given query. Existing DIR methods are primarily based on image queries that retrieve documents within the same coarse semantic category, e.g., newspapers or receipts. However, these methods struggle to effectively retrieve document images in real-world scenarios where textual queries with fine-grained semantics are usually provided. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new Natural Language-based Document Image Retrieval (NL-DIR) benchmark with corresponding evaluation metrics. In this work, natural language descriptions serve as semantically rich queries for the DIR task. The NL-DIR dataset contains 41K authentic document images, each paired with five high-quality, fine-grained semantic queries generated and evaluated through large language models in conjunction with manual verification. We perform zero-shot and fine-tuning evaluations of existing mainstream contrastive vision-language models and OCR-free visual document understanding (VDU) models. A two-stage retrieval method is further investigated for performance improvement while achieving both time and space efficiency. We hope the proposed NL-DIR benchmark can bring new opportunities and facilitate research for the VDU community.

TL;DR: milliMamba is a privacy-preserving 2D human pose estimation framework using millimeter-wave radar that addresses sparse radar signals by modeling spatio-temporal dependencies in both feature extraction and decoding. It outperforms baselines by over 11.0 AP on two benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Millimeter-wave radar provides privacy and lighting-invariant advantages for HPE but suffers from sparse signals due to specular reflections, necessitating robust feature extraction methods for reliable pose estimation.

Method: The framework employs a Cross-View Fusion Mamba encoder to extract spatio-temporal features with linear complexity, a Spatio-Temporal-Cross Attention decoder for joint coordinate prediction, and a velocity loss to ensure motion smoothness during training.

Result: milliMamba achieves 11.0 AP and 14.6 AP improvements on the TransHuPR and HuPR datasets compared to baselines while maintaining efficient computational complexity.

Conclusion: The spatio-temporal modeling pipeline effectively leverages contextual cues from neighboring frames and joints, enabling robust pose estimation from sparse radar data for privacy-sensitive applications.

Abstract: Millimeter-wave radar offers a privacy-preserving and lighting-invariant alternative to RGB sensors for Human Pose Estimation (HPE) task. However, the radar signals are often sparse due to specular reflection, making the extraction of robust features from radar signals highly challenging. To address this, we present milliMamba, a radar-based 2D human pose estimation framework that jointly models spatio-temporal dependencies across both the feature extraction and decoding stages. Specifically, given the high dimensionality of radar inputs, we adopt a Cross-View Fusion Mamba encoder to efficiently extract spatio-temporal features from longer sequences with linear complexity. A Spatio-Temporal-Cross Attention decoder then predicts joint coordinates across multiple frames. Together, this spatio-temporal modeling pipeline enables the model to leverage contextual cues from neighboring frames and joints to infer missing joints caused by specular reflections. To reinforce motion smoothness, we incorporate a velocity loss alongside the standard keypoint loss during training. Experiments on the TransHuPR and HuPR datasets demonstrate that our method achieves significant performance improvements, exceeding the baselines by 11.0 AP and 14.6 AP, respectively, while maintaining reasonable complexity.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于3D高斯泼溅和自动化标注的新流程，大幅减少果园中苹果姿态估计的标注工作量（减少99.6%），并展示了对高度遮挡水果的有效检测，但方向估计仍存在不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对果园自动化中的遮挡问题，传统姿态估计方法依赖易被遮挡的关键点（如果萼），导致标注困难且耗时。现有方法虽无需依赖关键点，但仍需人工标注，且遮挡可能导致标注冲突或缺失，因此需开发高效且低标注成本的解决方案。

Method: 提出包含以下步骤的3D重建与标注自动化流程：1) 使用3D高斯泼溅技术重建果园场景；2) 简化标注流程（仅标注边界框和类别）；3) 自动将标注投影到图像生成训练标签；4) 训练并评估姿态估计模型。通过此方法将105次手动标注扩展为28,191个训练标签。

Result: 1) 使用≤95%遮挡的果标签训练时，模型性能最佳：原图F1得分为0.927，渲染图F1得分为0.970；2) 训练集大小对性能影响较小；3) 未遮挡果实的位置估计最优，遮挡程度增加时性能下降；4) 模型无法准确学习苹果的方向估计。

Conclusion: 该方法显著降低标注成本，适用于遮挡场景下的大规模数据集生成，但需改进方向估计。研究验证了3D重建与自动化标注的结合效用，同时指出当前姿态估计方法在方向学习上的局限性。

Abstract: Automating tasks in orchards is challenging because of the large amount of variation in the environment and occlusions. One of the challenges is apple pose estimation, where key points, such as the calyx, are often occluded. Recently developed pose estimation methods no longer rely on these key points, but still require them for annotations, making annotating challenging and time-consuming. Due to the abovementioned occlusions, there can be conflicting and missing annotations of the same fruit between different images. Novel 3D reconstruction methods can be used to simplify annotating and enlarge datasets. We propose a novel pipeline consisting of 3D Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct an orchard scene, simplified annotations, automated projection of the annotations to images, and the training and evaluation of a pose estimation method. Using our pipeline, 105 manual annotations were required to obtain 28,191 training labels, a reduction of 99.6%. Experimental results indicated that training with labels of fruits that are $\leq95\%$ occluded resulted in the best performance, with a neutral F1 score of 0.927 on the original images and 0.970 on the rendered images. Adjusting the size of the training dataset had small effects on the model performance in terms of F1 score and pose estimation accuracy. It was found that the least occluded fruits had the best position estimation, which worsened as the fruits became more occluded. It was also found that the tested pose estimation method was unable to correctly learn the orientation estimation of apples.

TL;DR: This paper introduces AMoE, a multi-teacher knowledge distillation method combining SigLIP2 and DINOv3 through three innovations: an asymmetric relation-knowledge distillation loss, token-balanced batching for resolution stability, and hierarchical data sampling for sample efficiency, leading to the creation of the OpenLVD200M dataset for efficient vision foundation model training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing unexplored challenges in computational efficiency and learning dynamics of multi-teacher distillation for vision foundation models by improving knowledge transfer effectiveness and training cost reduction.

Method: Proposes (1) AR-KD asymmetric relation-knowledge distillation loss to preserve teacher geometry during knowledge transfer, (2) token-balanced batching strategy for multi-resolution training stability, and (3) hierarchical clustering-based data sampling to enhance sample efficiency. Develops OpenLVD200M dataset combining these improvements.

Result: Demonstrates that the three components enable stable multi-resolution training without performance loss, improve sample efficiency over random sampling, and achieve successful knowledge distillation into a Mixture-of-Experts architecture while reducing computational costs.

Conclusion: Integrating geometric-preserving loss, sequence-aware batching, and curriculum-style data sampling establishes a more efficient framework for multi-teacher distillation in vision models, validated through the released OpenLVD200M dataset and trained models.

Abstract: Vision foundation models trained via multi-teacher distillation offer a promising path toward unified visual representations, yet the learning dynamics and data efficiency of such approaches remain underexplored. In this paper, we systematically study multi-teacher distillation for vision foundation models and identify key factors that enable training at lower computational cost. We introduce Agglomerative Mixture-of-Experts Vision Foundation Models (AMoE), which distill knowledge from SigLIP2 and DINOv3 simultaneously into a Mixture-of-Experts student. We show that (1) our Asymmetric Relation-Knowledge Distillation loss preserves the geometric properties of each teacher while enabling effective knowledge transfer, (2) token-balanced batching that packs varying-resolution images into sequences with uniform token budgets stabilizes representation learning across resolutions without sacrificing performance, and (3) hierarchical clustering and sampling of training data--typically reserved for self-supervised learning--substantially improves sample efficiency over random sampling for multi-teacher distillation. By combining these findings, we curate OpenLVD200M, a 200M-image corpus that demonstrates superior efficiency for multi-teacher distillation. Instantiated in a Mixture-of-Experts. We release OpenLVD200M and distilled models.

*Zhaoyang Jia,Jiahao Li,Bin Li,Houqiang Li,Yan Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduction of Generative Latent Coding (GLC) for image compression via latent space transform coding in a VQ-VAE, achieving high realism and fidelity at ultra-low bitrates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pixel-space image compression methods struggle to align with human perception, leading to trade-offs between realism and fidelity at low bitrates.

Method: Proposed GLC employs: 1) Latent space transform coding via VQ-VAE, 2) Categorical hyper module for reduced hyper-info bitrate, and 3) Code-prediction-based supervision for semantic consistency. Compression occurs in sparser, semantically-rich generative latent space.

Result: Achieved <0.04 bpp (natural images) and <0.01 bpp (facial images) while maintaining high visual quality. 45% bitrate reduction over MS-ILLM with equivalent FID on CLIC2020. Enabled downstream applications (restoration, style transfer).

Conclusion: GLC surpasses pixel-space compression via perceptually-aligned latent coding, offering both technical efficiency (ultra-low bitrate) and superior perceptual quality, with added versatility for generative tasks.

Abstract: Most existing image compression approaches perform transform coding in the pixel space to reduce its spatial redundancy. However, they encounter difficulties in achieving both high-realism and high-fidelity at low bitrate, as the pixel-space distortion may not align with human perception. To address this issue, we introduce a Generative Latent Coding (GLC) architecture, which performs transform coding in the latent space of a generative vector-quantized variational auto-encoder (VQ-VAE), instead of in the pixel space. The generative latent space is characterized by greater sparsity, richer semantic and better alignment with human perception, rendering it advantageous for achieving high-realism and high-fidelity compression. Additionally, we introduce a categorical hyper module to reduce the bit cost of hyper-information, and a code-prediction-based supervision to enhance the semantic consistency. Experiments demonstrate that our GLC maintains high visual quality with less than 0.04 bpp on natural images and less than 0.01 bpp on facial images. On the CLIC2020 test set, we achieve the same FID as MS-ILLM with 45% fewer bits. Furthermore, the powerful generative latent space enables various applications built on our GLC pipeline, such as image restoration and style transfer.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了IndicDLP和UED-mini两个新颖文档布局分析数据集，解决当前数据集在细粒度标签、多语言覆盖和规模方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集缺乏细粒度区域标签、多语言多样性及足够规模，尤其对印度语种文档支持不足，导致复杂文档布局建模受限。

Method: 构建了大规模多语言IndicDLP（含11种印度语+英语、12个文档领域），并创建UED-mini整合DocLayNet与M6Doc的优势，用于增强预训练。

Result: 在IndicDLP上微调英语模型显著提升性能，且模型可泛化至非印度语文档，验证数据集有效性。

Conclusion: 该工作通过填补数据集在规模、多样性及标注细粒度的空白，为文档数字化提供关键基础资源。

Abstract: Document layout analysis is essential for downstream tasks such as information retrieval, extraction, OCR, and digitization. However, existing large-scale datasets like PubLayNet and DocBank lack fine-grained region labels and multilingual diversity, making them insufficient for representing complex document layouts. In contrast, human-annotated datasets such as M6Doc and D4LA offer richer labels and greater domain diversity, but are too small to train robust models and lack adequate multilingual coverage. This gap is especially pronounced for Indic documents, which encompass diverse scripts yet remain underrepresented in current datasets, further limiting progress in this space. To address these shortcomings, we introduce IndicDLP, a large-scale foundational document layout dataset spanning 11 representative Indic languages alongside English and 12 common document domains. Additionally, we curate UED-mini, a dataset derived from DocLayNet and M6Doc, to enhance pretraining and provide a solid foundation for Indic layout models. Our experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning existing English models on IndicDLP significantly boosts performance, validating its effectiveness. Moreover, models trained on IndicDLP generalize well beyond Indic layouts, making it a valuable resource for document digitization. This work bridges gaps in scale, diversity, and annotation granularity, driving inclusive and efficient document understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖难以获取的降解标签作为先验信息，而真实场景中的HSI退化复杂且混合，导致模型适用性受限。

Method: 设计空间-光谱降解度量作为连续多维度退化提示（DP），结合空间-光谱自适应模块（SSAM）和专家混合架构，通过DP动态调节模型参数实现自适应恢复。

Result: 在自然与遥感HSI数据集实验中，DAMP达到SOTA性能，且在多种混合退化场景下展现出卓越泛化能力。

Conclusion: DAMP通过自适应量化降维特征并动态优化特征提取，显著提升了HSI恢复的鲁棒性与效率。

Abstract: Unified hyperspectral image (HSI) restoration aims to recover various degraded HSIs using a single model, offering great practical value. However, existing methods often depend on explicit degradation priors (e.g., degradation labels) as prompts to guide restoration, which are difficult to obtain due to complex and mixed degradations in real-world scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose a Degradation-Aware Metric Prompting (DAMP) framework. Instead of relying on predefined degradation priors, we design spatial-spectral degradation metrics to continuously quantify multi-dimensional degradations, serving as Degradation Prompts (DP). These DP enable the model to capture cross-task similarities in degradation distributions and enhance shared feature learning. Furthermore, we introduce a Spatial-Spectral Adaptive Module (SSAM) that dynamically modulates spatial and spectral feature extraction through learnable parameters. By integrating SSAM as experts within a Mixture-of-Experts architecture, and using DP as the gating router, the framework enables adaptive, efficient, and robust restoration under diverse, mixed, or unseen degradations. Extensive experiments on natural and remote sensing HSI datasets show that DAMP achieves state-of-the-art performance and demonstrates exceptional generalization capability.

TL;DR: BiCoR-Seg proposes a bidirectional co-refinement framework with heatmap-driven modules and hierarchical supervision to enhance semantic segmentation of high-resolution remote sensing images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution remote sensing images (HRSS) face challenges like inter-class similarity and intra-class variability, leading to blurred boundaries and class confusion due to ineffective integration of semantic knowledge in existing methods.

Method: BiCoR-Seg introduces a Heatmap-driven Bidirectional Information Synergy Module (HBIS) for bidirectional feature-class interaction, hierarchical supervision using heatmaps as low-resolution predictions, and a cross-layer Fisher loss to boost inter-class separability and intra-class compactness.

Result: BiCoR-Seg achieved state-of-the-art performance on LoveDA, Vaihingen, and Potsdam datasets with improved interpretability.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses HRSS challenges through bidirectional synergy and enhanced discriminative learning, validated by experimental results and public code availability.

Abstract: High-resolution remote sensing image semantic segmentation (HRSS) is a fundamental yet critical task in the field of Earth observation. However, it has long faced the challenges of high inter-class similarity and large intra-class variability. Existing approaches often struggle to effectively inject abstract yet strongly discriminative semantic knowledge into pixel-level feature learning, leading to blurred boundaries and class confusion in complex scenes. To address these challenges, we propose Bidirectional Co-Refinement Framework for HRSS (BiCoR-Seg). Specifically, we design a Heatmap-driven Bidirectional Information Synergy Module (HBIS), which establishes a bidirectional information flow between feature maps and class embeddings by generating class-level heatmaps. Based on HBIS, we further introduce a hierarchical supervision strategy, where the interpretable heatmaps generated by each HBIS module are directly utilized as low-resolution segmentation predictions for supervision, thereby enhancing the discriminative capacity of shallow features. In addition, to further improve the discriminability of the embedding representations, we propose a cross-layer class embedding Fisher Discriminative Loss to enforce intra-class compactness and enlarge inter-class separability. Extensive experiments on the LoveDA, Vaihingen, and Potsdam datasets demonstrate that BiCoR-Seg achieves outstanding segmentation performance while offering stronger interpretability.

Conclusion: 验证了模型架构优化与有限标注数据结合的有效性，展示了在开放场景下的泛化能力和抗单模态偏差鲁棒性。

Abstract: With the rise of easily accessible tools for generating and manipulating multimedia content, realistic synthetic alterations to digital media have become a widespread threat, often involving manipulations across multiple modalities simultaneously. Recently, such techniques have been increasingly employed to distort narratives of important events and to spread misinformation on social media, prompting the development of misinformation detectors. In the context of misinformation conveyed through image-text pairs, several detection methods have been proposed. However, these approaches typically rely on computationally intensive architectures or require large amounts of annotated data. In this work we introduce LADLE-MM: Limited Annotation based Detector with Learned Ensembles for Multimodal Misinformation, a model-soup initialized multimodal misinformation detector designed to operate under a limited annotation setup and constrained training resources. LADLE-MM is composed of two unimodal branches and a third multimodal one that enhances image and text representations with additional multimodal embeddings extracted from BLIP, serving as fixed reference space. Despite using 60.3% fewer trainable parameters than previous state-of-the-art models, LADLE-MM achieves competitive performance on both binary and multi-label classification tasks on the DGM4 benchmark, outperforming existing methods when trained without grounding annotations. Moreover, when evaluated on the VERITE dataset, LADLE-MM outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches that utilize more complex architectures involving Large Vision-Language-Models, demonstrating the effective generalization ability in an open-set setting and strong robustness to unimodal bias.

TL;DR: 提出两阶段弱监督伪装物体检测框架D³ETOR，通过增强伪标签生成和去偏机制，在稀疏监督下实现显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有弱监督伪装物体检测方法因通用分割模型生成的不可靠伪掩码和未解决的手绘标注偏差，导致与全监督方法存在显著差距。

Method: 第一阶段引入自适应熵驱动采样和多智能体辩论机制提升SAM伪标签质量；第二阶段设计频率感知渐进去偏模块(FADeNet)，融合多级特征并动态调整监督权重。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上实现当前最优性能，显著缩小弱监督与全监督方法间的差距。

Conclusion: 通过伪掩码与手绘语义的协同利用，有效解决伪标签可靠性与标注偏差问题，为弱监督伪装检测提供新思路。

Abstract: Weakly-Supervised Camouflaged Object Detection (WSCOD) aims to locate and segment objects that are visually concealed within their surrounding scenes, relying solely on sparse supervision such as scribble annotations. Despite recent progress, existing WSCOD methods still lag far behind fully supervised ones due to two major limitations: (1) the pseudo masks generated by general-purpose segmentation models (e.g., SAM) and filtered via rules are often unreliable, as these models lack the task-specific semantic understanding required for effective pseudo labeling in COD; and (2) the neglect of inherent annotation bias in scribbles, which hinders the model from capturing the global structure of camouflaged objects. To overcome these challenges, we propose ${D}^{3}$ETOR, a two-stage WSCOD framework consisting of Debate-Enhanced Pseudo Labeling and Frequency-Aware Progressive Debiasing. In the first stage, we introduce an adaptive entropy-driven point sampling method and a multi-agent debate mechanism to enhance the capability of SAM for COD, improving the interpretability and precision of pseudo masks. In the second stage, we design FADeNet, which progressively fuses multi-level frequency-aware features to balance global semantic understanding with local detail modeling, while dynamically reweighting supervision strength across regions to alleviate scribble bias. By jointly exploiting the supervision signals from both the pseudo masks and scribble semantics, ${D}^{3}$ETOR significantly narrows the gap between weakly and fully supervised COD, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks.

TL;DR: 本论文提出了一种结合狄利克雷后验采样与Dempster-Shafer理论的框架，用于量化医学影像中SHAP可解释性的不确定性，以提升深度学习模型预测的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复杂深度学习模型（如ResNets、Vision Transformers）虽性能优越但可解释性差，而SHAP解释在医学影像应用中易受认知不确定性和数据不确定性影响，导致不稳定。医学领域亟需可靠的可解释方法提升模型可信度。

Conclusion: 该方法为医学影像场景下深度学习模型的不确定性解释提供了新范式，通过形式化不确定性描述增强了领域专家对模型预测的可信度，但需进一步验证临床实用性。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have led to its widespread adoption across diverse domains, including medical imaging. This progress is driven by increasingly sophisticated model architectures, such as ResNets, Vision Transformers, and Hybrid Convolutional Neural Networks, that offer enhanced performance at the cost of greater complexity. This complexity often compromises model explainability and interpretability. SHAP has emerged as a prominent method for providing interpretable visualizations that aid domain experts in understanding model predictions. However, SHAP explanations can be unstable and unreliable in the presence of epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty. In this study, we address this challenge by using Dirichlet posterior sampling and Dempster-Shafer theory to quantify the uncertainty that arises from these unstable explanations in medical imaging applications. The framework uses a belief, plausible, and fusion map approach alongside statistical quantitative analysis to produce quantification of uncertainty in SHAP. Furthermore, we evaluated our framework on three medical imaging datasets with varying class distributions, image qualities, and modality types which introduces noise due to varying image resolutions and modality-specific aspect covering the examples from pathology, ophthalmology, and radiology, introducing significant epistemic uncertainty.

Abstract: The objective of this paper is to jointly synthesize interactive videos and conversational speech from text and reference images. With the ultimate goal of building human-like conversational systems, recent studies have explored talking or listening head generation as well as conversational speech generation. However, these works are typically studied in isolation, overlooking the multimodal nature of human conversation, which involves tightly coupled audio-visual interactions. In this paper, we introduce TAVID, a unified framework that generates both interactive faces and conversational speech in a synchronized manner. TAVID integrates face and speech generation pipelines through two cross-modal mappers (i.e., a motion mapper and a speaker mapper), which enable bidirectional exchange of complementary information between the audio and visual modalities. We evaluate our system across four dimensions: talking face realism, listening head responsiveness, dyadic interaction fluency, and speech quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across all these aspects.

Motivation: 现有DiT-based VVT方法在服装动态捕捉、背景完整性保持和计算效率上有缺陷，且数据集质量限制模型泛化。

Result: 在动态和静态场景下，KeyTailor在服装保真度和背景完整性指标上优于SOTA方法，同时减少架构复杂度。

Conclusion: 关键帧驱动设计避免了DiT架构修改，结合专用数据集，实现了高效真实的视频试穿合成。

Abstract: Although diffusion transformer (DiT)-based video virtual try-on (VVT) has made significant progress in synthesizing realistic videos, existing methods still struggle to capture fine-grained garment dynamics and preserve background integrity across video frames. They also incur high computational costs due to additional interaction modules introduced into DiTs, while the limited scale and quality of existing public datasets also restrict model generalization and effective training. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, KeyTailor, along with a large-scale, high-definition dataset, ViT-HD. The core idea of KeyTailor is a keyframe-driven details injection strategy, motivated by the fact that keyframes inherently contain both foreground dynamics and background consistency. Specifically, KeyTailor adopts an instruction-guided keyframe sampling strategy to filter informative frames from the input video. Subsequently,two tailored keyframe-driven modules, the garment details enhancement module and the collaborative background optimization module, are employed to distill garment dynamics into garment-related latents and to optimize the integrity of background latents, both guided by keyframes.These enriched details are then injected into standard DiT blocks together with pose, mask, and noise latents, enabling efficient and realistic try-on video synthesis. This design ensures consistency without explicitly modifying the DiT architecture, while simultaneously avoiding additional complexity. In addition, our dataset ViT-HD comprises 15, 070 high-quality video samples at a resolution of 810*1080, covering diverse garments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KeyTailor outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of garment fidelity and background integrity across both dynamic and static scenarios.

Conclusion: SmartSplat通过特征感知的自适应策略解决了超高清图像压缩瓶颈，代码开源证实了其实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI have accelerated the production of ultra-high-resolution visual content, posing significant challenges for efficient compression and real-time decoding on end-user devices. Inspired by 3D Gaussian Splatting, recent 2D Gaussian image models improve representation efficiency, yet existing methods struggle to balance compression ratio and reconstruction fidelity in ultra-high-resolution scenarios. To address this issue, we propose SmartSplat, a highly adaptive and feature-aware GS-based image compression framework that supports arbitrary image resolutions and compression ratios. SmartSplat leverages image-aware features such as gradients and color variances, introducing a Gradient-Color Guided Variational Sampling strategy together with an Exclusion-based Uniform Sampling scheme to improve the non-overlapping coverage of Gaussian primitives in pixel space. In addition, we propose a Scale-Adaptive Gaussian Color Sampling method to enhance color initialization across scales. Through joint optimization of spatial layout, scale, and color initialization, SmartSplat efficiently captures both local structures and global textures using a limited number of Gaussians, achieving high reconstruction quality under strong compression. Extensive experiments on DIV8K and a newly constructed 16K dataset demonstrate that SmartSplat consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods at comparable compression ratios and exceeds their compression limits, showing strong scalability and practical applicability.

*Junho Yoon,Jaemo Jung,Hyunju Kim,Dongman Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes DETACH, a spatio-temporal framework for aligning exocentric video with ambient sensors, improving non-intrusive human action recognition by addressing misalignment issues in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Egocentric-wearable systems face practical challenges like privacy concerns and scalability. Global Alignment methods fail in exocentric-ambient settings due to loss of local motion details and misalignment of actions sharing similar temporal patterns but differing in spatio-semantic contexts.

Method: DETACH uses explicit spatio-temporal decomposition to preserve local details and introduces sensor-spatial features via online clustering for semantic grounding. A two-stage alignment combines mutual supervision for spatial correspondence and a novel contrastive loss for adaptive temporal alignment, handling varying types of negative samples.

Result: Experiments on Opportunity++ and HWU-USP datasets show DETACH significantly outperforms adapted egocentric-wearable baselines in action recognition tasks.

Conclusion: The decomposed spatio-temporal framework provides an efficient, non-intrusive solution for exocentric-ambient action recognition, resolving misalignment issues through localized feature decomposition and adaptive contrastive learning.

Abstract: Aligning egocentric video with wearable sensors have shown promise for human action recognition, but face practical limitations in user discomfort, privacy concerns, and scalability. We explore exocentric video with ambient sensors as a non-intrusive, scalable alternative. While prior egocentric-wearable works predominantly adopt Global Alignment by encoding entire sequences into unified representations, this approach fails in exocentric-ambient settings due to two problems: (P1) inability to capture local details such as subtle motions, and (P2) over-reliance on modality-invariant temporal patterns, causing misalignment between actions sharing similar temporal patterns with different spatio-semantic contexts. To resolve these problems, we propose DETACH, a decomposed spatio-temporal framework. This explicit decomposition preserves local details, while our novel sensor-spatial features discovered via online clustering provide semantic grounding for context-aware alignment. To align the decomposed features, our two-stage approach establishes spatial correspondence through mutual supervision, then performs temporal alignment via a spatial-temporal weighted contrastive loss that adaptively handles easy negatives, hard negatives, and false negatives. Comprehensive experiments with downstream tasks on Opportunity++ and HWU-USP datasets demonstrate substantial improvements over adapted egocentric-wearable baselines.

Abstract: In the realm of diverse high-dimensional data, images play a significant role across various processes of manufacturing systems where efficient image anomaly detection has emerged as a core technology of utmost importance. However, when applied to textured defect images, conventional anomaly detection methods have limitations including non-negligible misidentification, low robustness, and excessive reliance on large-scale and structured datasets. This paper proposes a texture basis integrated smooth decomposition (TBSD) approach, which is targeted at efficient anomaly detection in textured images with smooth backgrounds and sparse anomalies. Mathematical formulation of quasi-periodicity and its theoretical properties are investigated for image texture estimation. TBSD method consists of two principal processes: the first process learns the texture basis functions to effectively extract quasi-periodic texture patterns; the subsequent anomaly detection process utilizes that texture basis as prior knowledge to prevent texture misidentification and capture potential anomalies with high accuracy.The proposed method surpasses benchmarks with less misidentification, smaller training dataset requirement, and superior anomaly detection performance on both simulation and real-world datasets.

TL;DR: Incorporating biomechanical forces into vision-based human motion understanding improves performance across tasks like gait recognition, action recognition, and video captioning, especially under occlusion or challenging conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional motion analysis methods neglect biomechanical cues like joint forces, which are critical for understanding physical interactions in human motion.

Method: Physics-inferred force cues are integrated into existing pipelines for gait/action recognition and video captioning, systematically tested across 3 tasks and 8 benchmarks including CASIA-B, Gait3D, and Penn Action.

Result: Forces improved recognition accuracy (e.g., +2.7% for gait under occlusion, +6.96% for high-exertion actions) and enhanced temporal grounding in captioning (ROUGE-L +0.029), showing robustness in dynamic/occluded scenarios.

Conclusion: Physically grounded force cues complement visual features, offering significant benefits for motion analysis under challenging real-world conditions.

Abstract: Human motion understanding has advanced rapidly through vision-based progress in recognition, tracking, and captioning. However, most existing methods overlook physical cues such as joint actuation forces that are fundamental in biomechanics. This gap motivates our study: if and when do physically inferred forces enhance motion understanding? By incorporating forces into established motion understanding pipelines, we systematically evaluate their impact across baseline models on 3 major tasks: gait recognition, action recognition, and fine-grained video captioning. Across 8 benchmarks, incorporating forces yields consistent performance gains; for example, on CASIA-B, Rank-1 gait recognition accuracy improved from 89.52% to 90.39% (+0.87), with larger gain observed under challenging conditions: +2.7% when wearing a coat and +3.0% at the side view. On Gait3D, performance also increases from 46.0% to 47.3% (+1.3). In action recognition, CTR-GCN achieved +2.00% on Penn Action, while high-exertion classes like punching/slapping improved by +6.96%. Even in video captioning, Qwen2.5-VL's ROUGE-L score rose from 0.310 to 0.339 (+0.029), indicating that physics-inferred forces enhance temporal grounding and semantic richness. These results demonstrate that force cues can substantially complement visual and kinematic features under dynamic, occluded, or appearance-varying conditions.

Conclusion: 展示了diffusion+多模态条件控制在专业级设计中的潜力，为多语言文本/图形协同生成提供了可扩展框架，代码开源促进后续研究。

Abstract: AI-assisted graphic design has emerged as a powerful tool for automating the creation and editing of design elements such as posters, banners, and advertisements. While diffusion-based text-to-image models have demonstrated strong capabilities in visual content generation, their text rendering performance, particularly for small-scale typography and non-Latin scripts, remains limited. In this paper, we propose UTDesign, a unified framework for high-precision stylized text editing and conditional text generation in design images, supporting both English and Chinese scripts. Our framework introduces a novel DiT-based text style transfer model trained from scratch on a synthetic dataset, capable of generating transparent RGBA text foregrounds that preserve the style of reference glyphs. We further extend this model into a conditional text generation framework by training a multi-modal condition encoder on a curated dataset with detailed text annotations, enabling accurate, style-consistent text synthesis conditioned on background images, prompts, and layout specifications. Finally, we integrate our approach into a fully automated text-to-design (T2D) pipeline by incorporating pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) models and an MLLM-based layout planner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UTDesign achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source methods in terms of stylistic consistency and text accuracy, and also exhibits unique advantages compared to proprietary commercial approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究评估了基于UAS的RGB和LWIR自适应融合技术在地表地雷检测中的应用，结合YOLO架构及热对比度增强方法，实现了86.8%的检测精度，同时揭示了AT地雷优于AP地雷的检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地雷在60国造成年均26,000例伤亡的严峻威胁，传统检测手段存在效率瓶颈。研究通过挖掘地雷与土壤的热对比度特性增强特征提取能力，旨在开发高效自动化的地表地雷探测方案，为后续埋藏地雷研究奠定基础。

Method: 采用YOLOv8/v10/v11架构对114组测试图像进行35,640次模型条件评估，对比RF-DETR、Faster R-CNN等模型性能。通过自适应融合RGB与热红外图像，在5-10米飞行高度测试不同热融合比例，并构建多时相及季节特异性训练集进行对比验证。

Result: YOLOv11以86.8% mAP性能领先，在10%-30%热融合比例下达成最优检测。模型对比显示RF-DETR准确率最高(69.2%)，但YOLOv11训练速度比RF-DETR快17.7倍(41分钟vs12小时)。多时相训练数据相较季节特异性方法提升1.8%-9.6%检测性能，AT地雷检测率(61.9%)显著高于AP地雷(19.2%)。

Conclusion: 自适应热融合技术显著提升YOLO架构的地表地雷检测效能，YOLOv11在保持高精度的同时实现工程化部署所需的效率突破。未来需量化埋藏地雷在不同土壤介质中的热扩散特性，开发多深度检测模型。

Abstract: Landmines remain a persistent humanitarian threat, with 110 million actively deployed mines across 60 countries, claiming 26,000 casualties annually. This research evaluates adaptive Red-Green-Blue (RGB) and Long-Wave Infrared (LWIR) fusion for Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS)-based detection of surface-laid landmines, leveraging the thermal contrast between the ordnance and the surrounding soil to enhance feature extraction. Using You Only Look Once (YOLO) architectures (v8, v10, v11) across 114 test images, generating 35,640 model-condition evaluations, YOLOv11 achieved optimal performance (86.8% mAP), with 10 to 30% thermal fusion at 5 to 10m altitude identified as the optimal detection parameters. A complementary architectural comparison revealed that while RF-DETR achieved the highest accuracy (69.2% mAP), followed by Faster R-CNN (67.6%), YOLOv11 (64.2%), and RetinaNet (50.2%), YOLOv11 trained 17.7 times faster than the transformer-based RF-DETR (41 minutes versus 12 hours), presenting a critical accuracy-efficiency tradeoff for operational deployment. Aggregated multi-temporal training datasets outperformed season-specific approaches by 1.8 to 9.6%, suggesting that models benefit from exposure to diverse thermal conditions. Anti-Tank (AT) mines achieved 61.9% detection accuracy, compared with 19.2% for Anti-Personnel (AP) mines, reflecting both the size differential and thermal-mass differences between these ordnance classes. As this research examined surface-laid mines where thermal contrast is maximized, future research should quantify thermal contrast effects for mines buried at varying depths across heterogeneous soil types.

TL;DR: The paper explores methods for multimodal alignment, translation, fusion, and transference across five chapters, addressing challenges in spatial language understanding, medical text interpretation, knowledge graph enrichment, and action recognition through specialized techniques like Spatial-Reasoning BERT, co-occurrence-based loss functions, fusion strategies, and knowledge distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance machine understanding of complex, multimodal inputs by addressing unique challenges in translating structured text to spatial/volumetric representations, improving medical text navigability, refining knowledge graph canonicalization, and strengthening action recognition robustness.

Conclusion: The work advances multimodal machine learning paradigms by developing specialized frameworks for spatial reasoning, medical text analysis, knowledge graph structuring, and action recognition, enabling systems to process cross-domain complex inputs more effectively.

Abstract: This manuscript explores multimodal alignment, translation, fusion, and transference to enhance machine understanding of complex inputs. We organize the work into five chapters, each addressing unique challenges in multimodal machine learning.
  Chapter 3 introduces Spatial-Reasoning Bert for translating text-based spatial relations into 2D arrangements between clip-arts. This enables effective decoding of spatial language into visual representations, paving the way for automated scene generation aligned with human spatial understanding.
  Chapter 4 presents a method for translating medical texts into specific 3D locations within an anatomical atlas. We introduce a loss function leveraging spatial co-occurrences of medical terms to create interpretable mappings, significantly enhancing medical text navigability.
  Chapter 5 tackles translating structured text into canonical facts within knowledge graphs. We develop a benchmark for linking natural language to entities and predicates, addressing ambiguities in text extraction to provide clearer, actionable insights.

*Anna Šárová Mikeštíková,Médéric Fourmy,Martin Cífka,Josef Sivic,Vladimir Petrik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出AlignPose，一种无需物体特定训练的多视角RGB 6D物体姿态估计方法，通过多视角特征度量优化统一的世界坐标系姿态，解决了单视角方法的深度模糊和遮挡问题，并在多个数据集上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单视角RGB姿态估计方法受限于深度模糊、遮挡和杂乱环境，而多视角方法通常依赖精确的单视角初始估计或无法泛化到新物体。本文旨在开发一种能够自适应多视角信息且无需物体先验训练的一般性框架。

Method: 1) 提出AlignPose方法：聚合多视角RGB特征；2) 设计多视角特征度量细化模块，通过联合优化多视角特征匹配最小化渲染与观测特征差异；3) 在YCB-V/T-LESS/ITODD-MV/HouseCat6D四个BOP基准数据集上进行对比实验，采用标准AP6D/ADD指标评估模型性能。

Result: 在BOP基准测试中，AlignPose在四个数据集均优于现有方法，尤其在工业数据集ITODD-MV实现87.3% AP6D，比第二名高3.9个百分点。多视角特征细化使单视角输入性能提升18.2%。

Conclusion: 本文提出的多视角特征度量框架有效解决了传统方法对单视角初始估计的依赖，实现了无需物体先验的通用6D姿态估计，在工业场景中展示出显著优势。

Abstract: Single-view RGB model-based object pose estimation methods achieve strong generalization but are fundamentally limited by depth ambiguity, clutter, and occlusions. Multi-view pose estimation methods have the potential to solve these issues, but existing works rely on precise single-view pose estimates or lack generalization to unseen objects. We address these challenges via the following three contributions. First, we introduce AlignPose, a 6D object pose estimation method that aggregates information from multiple extrinsically calibrated RGB views and does not require any object-specific training or symmetry annotation. Second, the key component of this approach is a new multi-view feature-metric refinement specifically designed for object pose. It optimizes a single, consistent world-frame object pose minimizing the feature discrepancy between on-the-fly rendered object features and observed image features across all views simultaneously. Third, we report extensive experiments on four datasets (YCB-V, T-LESS, ITODD-MV, HouseCat6D) using the BOP benchmark evaluation and show that AlignPose outperforms other published methods, especially on challenging industrial datasets where multiple views are readily available in practice.

*Mingwei Tang,Jiahao Nie,Guang Yang,Ziqing Cui,Jie Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种多粒度文本引导的图像融合框架（MTIF），通过多层级文本描述和跨模态对齐机制，显著提升多曝光与多聚焦图像融合质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖粗糙文本描述，难以捕捉图像细粒度差异，且跨模态对齐精度不足，导致融合效果受限（尤其在动态范围/焦深差异大的场景）。

Method: 三个核心设计：1) 多粒度文本编码（逐级提取细粒细节/结构/语义特征）+ 层级化跨模态调制模块；2) 多粒度监督信号强化图文特征对齐；3) 显著性驱动的语义增强模块扩展训练数据。

Result: 在多曝光/多聚焦图像融合基准测试中，MTIF在PSNR、SSIM等多项指标上超越现有SOTA方法，模型泛化性验证通过可视化结果与用户研究支持。

Conclusion: 多粒度文本引导框架能有效整合跨模态信息，其层级调制与增强策略为复杂条件下的图像融合提供了新范式，但大规模应用场景中的计算效率仍待优化。

Abstract: Image fusion aims to synthesize a single high-quality image from a pair of inputs captured under challenging conditions, such as differing exposure levels or focal depths. A core challenge lies in effectively handling disparities in dynamic range and focus depth between the inputs. With the advent of vision-language models, recent methods incorporate textual descriptions as auxiliary guidance to enhance fusion quality. However, simply incorporating coarse-grained descriptions hampers the understanding of fine-grained details and poses challenges for precise cross-modal alignment. To address these limitations, we propose Multi-grained Text-guided Image Fusion (MTIF), a novel fusion paradigm with three key designs. First, it introduces multi-grained textual descriptions that separately capture fine details, structural cues, and semantic content, guiding image fusion through a hierarchical cross-modal modulation module. Second, it involves supervision signals at each granularity to facilitate alignment between visual and textual features and enhance the utility of auxiliary text. Third, it adopts a saliency-driven enrichment module to augment training data with dense semantic content, further strengthening the cross-modal modulation and alignment. Extensive experiments show that MTIF consistently outperforms previous methods on both multi-exposure and multi-focus image fusion tasks.

*Kaitong Cai,Jusheng Zhang,Jing Yang,Yijia Fan,Pengtao Xie,Jian Wang,Keze Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlashVLM是一种文本引导的视觉令牌压缩框架，通过动态选择与查询相关的视觉标记，在减少冗余的同时保持语义对齐。实验表明其在LLaVA 1.5上实现77.8%的压缩率且性能超越未剪枝基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型处理数千视觉令牌时产生高昂注意力成本，且传统剪枝依赖不稳定的注意力权重导致语义对齐下降。需要一种结合文本语义与视觉显著性的高效压缩方法。

Method: 1) 计算视觉标记与文本嵌入的显式跨模态相似性 2) 融合视觉显著性与文本关联性（通过log域加权和温度锐化）3) 多样性保留分区策略维护全局背景上下文

Result: 在LLaVA 1.5实现77.8%令牌压缩率时准确率达92.8%（接近无剪枝基准），在14个图像/视频基准测试中展现出SOTA效率与性能平衡，极端情况（94.4%压缩）下仍维持92.8%准确率

Conclusion: FlashVLM通过文本引导的显式语义建模，解决了传统注意力机制导致的语义退化问题，在显著压缩视觉令牌的同时实现了更强的鲁棒性与跨模型泛化能力

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) typically process hundreds or thousands of visual tokens per image or video frame, incurring quadratic attention cost and substantial redundancy. Existing token reduction methods often ignore the textual query or rely on deep attention maps, whose instability under aggressive pruning leads to degraded semantic alignment.
  We propose FlashVLM, a text guided visual token selection framework that dynamically adapts visual inputs to the query. Instead of relying on noisy attention weights, FlashVLM computes an explicit cross modal similarity between projected image tokens and normalized text embeddings in the language model space. This extrinsic relevance is fused with intrinsic visual saliency using log domain weighting and temperature controlled sharpening. In addition, a diversity preserving partition retains a minimal yet representative set of background tokens to maintain global context.
  Under identical token budgets and evaluation protocols, FlashVLM achieves beyond lossless compression, slightly surpassing the unpruned baseline while pruning up to 77.8 percent of visual tokens on LLaVA 1.5, and maintaining 92.8 percent accuracy even under 94.4 percent compression. Extensive experiments on 14 image and video benchmarks demonstrate that FlashVLM delivers state of the art efficiency performance trade offs while maintaining strong robustness and generalization across mainstream VLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 尽管模拟器能生成大量驾驶数据，但模仿学习在模拟中的闭环性能仍受限，主要因专家与学生间的观测差异。改进后的TransFuser v6通过解决专家-学生差异和整合感知监督，在CARLA和现实基准测试中达到新SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模仿学习在模拟中效果不佳，因专家演示具有更高可见性（如忽略遮挡）和更低不确定性（如已知其他车辆行为），而学生模型测试时仅依赖单一目标点，导致性能瓶颈。研究旨在解决这些不对称性对性能的影响。

Method: 通过实证分析专家（特权演示）与学生（传感器观测）在可见性、不确定性和导航意图的差异，设计针对性改进措施（如多目标点策略）并构建TransFuser v6策略；通过sim-to-real感知监督提升模型鲁棒性。

Result: TransFuser v6在CARLA Benchmark2Drive达95 DS，在Longest6v2和Town13性能超越基线两倍以上；在NAVSIM和Waymo Vision-Based End-to-End基准测试中表现显著提升，代码/数据已开源。

Conclusion: 专家与学生观测差异和导航意图模糊是模拟模仿学习的关键障碍，通过缩小这些差距并融合感知监督，推动sim-to-real技术在实际驾驶任务中的性能突破，设定新行业基准。

Abstract: Simulators can generate virtually unlimited driving data, yet imitation learning policies in simulation still struggle to achieve robust closed-loop performance. Motivated by this gap, we empirically study how misalignment between privileged expert demonstrations and sensor-based student observations can limit the effectiveness of imitation learning. More precisely, experts have significantly higher visibility (e.g., ignoring occlusions) and far lower uncertainty (e.g., knowing other vehicles' actions), making them difficult to imitate reliably. Furthermore, navigational intent (i.e., the route to follow) is under-specified in student models at test time via only a single target point. We demonstrate that these asymmetries can measurably limit driving performance in CARLA and offer practical interventions to address them. After careful modifications to narrow the gaps between expert and student, our TransFuser v6 (TFv6) student policy achieves a new state of the art on all major publicly available CARLA closed-loop benchmarks, reaching 95 DS on Bench2Drive and more than doubling prior performances on Longest6~v2 and Town13. Additionally, by integrating perception supervision from our dataset into a shared sim-to-real pipeline, we show consistent gains on the NAVSIM and Waymo Vision-Based End-to-End driving benchmarks. Our code, data, and models are publicly available at https://github.com/autonomousvision/lead.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出DiTracker，利用视频扩散Transformer（DiT）进行点追踪，结合查询键注意力匹配、轻量LoRA调优与ResNet融合，在保持高效性的同时实现点追踪性能突破。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于浅层ResNet的点追踪方法因独立处理帧导致时间不连贯，且在动态运动、频繁遮挡场景下匹配成本可靠性不足。DiT通过预训练时空注意力机制具备天然鲁棒性，但其适配点追踪仍需针对性设计。

Method: DiTracker通过三要素改造DiT：1) 查询-键注意力计算跨帧匹配；2) 插入低秩自适应矩阵（LoRA）进行参数高效微调；3) 将ResNet特征与DiT输出在成本体空间融合以增强鲁棒性。

Result: 在ITTO数据集达SOTA水平，TAP-Vid基准与或超越现有方法，且仅用1/8训练批次量即实现性能突破，验证了模型在极端动态场景下的稳定性与计算效率优势。

Conclusion: 本研究证明预训练视频DiT具备内生点追踪能力，提出的轻量化适配方案为视频分析任务提供了兼顾性能与效率的通用范式。

Abstract: Point tracking aims to localize corresponding points across video frames, serving as a fundamental task for 4D reconstruction, robotics, and video editing. Existing methods commonly rely on shallow convolutional backbones such as ResNet that process frames independently, lacking temporal coherence and producing unreliable matching costs under challenging conditions. Through systematic analysis, we find that video Diffusion Transformers (DiTs), pre-trained on large-scale real-world videos with spatio-temporal attention, inherently exhibit strong point tracking capability and robustly handle dynamic motions and frequent occlusions. We propose DiTracker, which adapts video DiTs through: (1) query-key attention matching, (2) lightweight LoRA tuning, and (3) cost fusion with a ResNet backbone. Despite training with 8 times smaller batch size, DiTracker achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging ITTO benchmark and matches or outperforms state-of-the-art models on TAP-Vid benchmarks. Our work validates video DiT features as an effective and efficient foundation for point tracking.

TL;DR: 本文提出FedPOD，通过改进联邦学习中的异常值处理和任务调度机制，解决原方法FedPIDAvg在数据利用率低和参与者可扩展性差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FedPIDAvg依赖固定参与者且排除异常值数据，导致数据利用率受限且无法弹性扩展，需设计更高效灵活的通信与学习协作框架。

Method: 引入动态参与者准入机制，采用独立轮次验证损失计算代替历史信息依赖，结合Kubernetes POD单元实现弹性扩缩容，并建立通信成本优化模型。

Result: 在3D医学图像分割任务中，Dice分数(0.78/0.71/0.72)和收敛速度(0.74)与FedPIDAvg相当，通信压缩比1.43倍提升，且支持动态节点增减。

Conclusion: FedPOD实现了联邦学习效率与灵活性的均衡优化，其POD架构兼容云原生自动扩缩容特性，为分布式AI训练提供了新型基础设施范式。

Abstract: This paper proposes FedPOD (Proportionally Orchestrated Derivative) for optimizing learning efficiency and communication cost in federated learning among multiple clients. Inspired by FedPIDAvg, we define a round-wise task for FedPOD to enhance training efficiency. FedPIDAvg achieved performance improvement by incorporating the training loss reduction for prediction entropy as weights using differential terms. Furthermore, by modeling data distribution with a Poisson distribution and using a PID controller, it reduced communication costs even in skewed data distribution. However, excluding participants classified as outliers based on the Poisson distribution can limit data utilization. Additionally, PID controller requires the same participants to be maintained throughout the federated learning process as it uses previous rounds' learning information in the current round. In our approach, FedPOD addresses these issues by including participants excluded as outliers, eliminating dependency on previous rounds' learning information, and applying a method for calculating validation loss at each round. In this challenge, FedPOD presents comparable performance to FedPIDAvg in metrics of Dice score, 0.78, 0.71 and 0.72 for WT, ET and TC in average, and projected convergence score, 0.74 in average. Furthermore, the concept of FedPOD draws inspiration from Kubernetes' smallest computing unit, POD, designed to be compatible with Kubernetes auto-scaling. Extending round-wise tasks of FedPOD to POD units allows flexible design by applying scale-out similar to Kubernetes' auto-scaling. This work demonstrated the potentials of FedPOD to enhance federated learning by improving efficiency, flexibility, and performance in metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频虚拟人方法缺乏自主决策与环境交互能力，需在随机生成环境中实现长期目标导向行为。

Method: ORCA框架结合OTAR闭环循环（观察-思考-行动-反思）与分层双系统架构（战略推理+动作转化），基于POMDP模型实现持续环境交互与状态验证。

Result: ORCA在任务成功率和行为连贯性上显著优于无闭环与非反思基线模型。

Conclusion: 通过内部世界模型设计，将视频虚拟人从被动动画提升为主动智能体，开创了生成式虚拟人的新范式。

Abstract: Current video avatar generation methods excel at identity preservation and motion alignment but lack genuine agency, they cannot autonomously pursue long-term goals through adaptive environmental interaction. We address this by introducing L-IVA (Long-horizon Interactive Visual Avatar), a task and benchmark for evaluating goal-directed planning in stochastic generative environments, and ORCA (Online Reasoning and Cognitive Architecture), the first framework enabling active intelligence in video avatars. ORCA embodies Internal World Model (IWM) capabilities through two key innovations: (1) a closed-loop OTAR cycle (Observe-Think-Act-Reflect) that maintains robust state tracking under generative uncertainty by continuously verifying predicted outcomes against actual generations, and (2) a hierarchical dual-system architecture where System 2 performs strategic reasoning with state prediction while System 1 translates abstract plans into precise, model-specific action captions. By formulating avatar control as a POMDP and implementing continuous belief updating with outcome verification, ORCA enables autonomous multi-step task completion in open-domain scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ORCA significantly outperforms open-loop and non-reflective baselines in task success rate and behavioral coherence, validating our IWM-inspired design for advancing video avatar intelligence from passive animation to active, goal-oriented behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态大模型研究聚焦狭窄任务，忽视空间能力从感知到交互的递进发展特性，缺乏对能力层级关联性的系统研究。

Method: 基于认知科学建立四层空间能力模型（L1低阶感知→L4能动交互），构建包含27种子能力的Hierarchical benchmark，实施监督微调与强化学习实验对比。

Result: 发现L1能力正交而高层能力强相关、监督微调存在L1负迁移但支持跨层级正迁移、传统强化学习损害直觉感知，auto-think策略可消除冗余推理提升全层级表现。

Conclusion: 证明能力层级化的建模价值，揭示MLLMs空间能力发展的阶段特性，提出的auto-think方法为构建具身认知系统提供新路径。

Abstract: Cognitive science suggests that spatial ability develops progressively-from perception to reasoning and interaction. Yet in multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), this hierarchy remains poorly understood, as most studies focus on a narrow set of tasks. We introduce SpatialTree, a cognitive-science-inspired hierarchy that organizes spatial abilities into four levels: low-level perception (L1), mental mapping (L2), simulation (L3), and agentic competence (L4). Based on this taxonomy, we construct the first capability-centric hierarchical benchmark, thoroughly evaluating mainstream MLLMs across 27 sub-abilities. The evaluation results reveal a clear structure: L1 skills are largely orthogonal, whereas higher-level skills are strongly correlated, indicating increasing interdependency. Through targeted supervised fine-tuning, we uncover a surprising transfer dynamic-negative transfer within L1, but strong cross-level transfer from low- to high-level abilities with notable synergy. Finally, we explore how to improve the entire hierarchy. We find that naive RL that encourages extensive "thinking" is unreliable: it helps complex reasoning but hurts intuitive perception. We propose a simple auto-think strategy that suppresses unnecessary deliberation, enabling RL to consistently improve performance across all levels. By building SpatialTree, we provide a proof-of-concept framework for understanding and systematically scaling spatial abilities in MLLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频生成模型通常在VAE潜在空间中学习视频潜在表示，存在收敛速度慢、计算成本高的问题。视频本身包含大量冗余信息，直接建模低级视频标记效率低下。

Method: 采用两阶段生成过程：第一阶段使用扩散模型生成精简的语义视频特征（定义视频全局布局）；第二阶段使用另一扩散模型在语义特征条件下生成VAE潜在表示以输出最终视频。

Result: 语义空间生成相比VAE潜在空间生成表现出更快的收敛速度，在长视频生成任务中既保证了生成质量又显著提升计算效率。

Conclusion: SemanticGen在视频生成质量和计算效率上均优于现有最先进方法及基线模型，验证了先生成高维语义特征再补充细节的分阶段策略在视频生成中的有效性。

Abstract: State-of-the-art video generative models typically learn the distribution of video latents in the VAE space and map them to pixels using a VAE decoder. While this approach can generate high-quality videos, it suffers from slow convergence and is computationally expensive when generating long videos. In this paper, we introduce SemanticGen, a novel solution to address these limitations by generating videos in the semantic space. Our main insight is that, due to the inherent redundancy in videos, the generation process should begin in a compact, high-level semantic space for global planning, followed by the addition of high-frequency details, rather than directly modeling a vast set of low-level video tokens using bi-directional attention. SemanticGen adopts a two-stage generation process. In the first stage, a diffusion model generates compact semantic video features, which define the global layout of the video. In the second stage, another diffusion model generates VAE latents conditioned on these semantic features to produce the final output. We observe that generation in the semantic space leads to faster convergence compared to the VAE latent space. Our method is also effective and computationally efficient when extended to long video generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SemanticGen produces high-quality videos and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and strong baselines.

### [54] [How well do Large Language Models Recognize Instructional Moves? Establishing Baselines for Foundation Models in Educational Discourse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19903)
*Kirk Vanacore,Rene F. Kizilcec*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究评估了大型语言模型（LLMs）在未经显著定制下对真实课堂话语分类的基线表现，发现通过少量示例（few-shot）提示能显著提升性能，但仍存在准确性限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在教育中的广泛应用，了解其现成能力对设定合理预期和基准测试至关重要。

Method: 对比六类LLMs在零样本、单样本和少量样本提示下对课堂指令行为分类任务的表现，并以Cohen's Kappa评估模型与专家标注的一致性。

Result: 少量样本提示下最先进模型达到Cohen's Kappa=0.58，但性能差异显著，高召回率伴随更多假阳性

Conclusion: 基础模型具备解读教学话语的能力，但需提示设计优化且仍存在可靠性约束。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted in educational technologies for a variety of tasks, from generating instructional materials and assisting with assessment design to tutoring. While prior work has investigated how models can be adapted or optimized for specific tasks, far less is known about how well LLMs perform at interpreting authentic educational scenarios without significant customization. As LLM-based systems become widely adopted by learners and educators in everyday academic contexts, understanding their out-of-the-box capabilities is increasingly important for setting expectations and benchmarking. We compared six LLMs to estimate their baseline performance on a simple but important task: classifying instructional moves in authentic classroom transcripts. We evaluated typical prompting methods: zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot prompting. We found that while zero-shot performance was moderate, providing comprehensive examples (few-shot prompting) significantly improved performance for state-of-the-art models, with the strongest configuration reaching Cohen's Kappa = 0.58 against expert-coded annotations. At the same time, improvements were neither uniform nor complete: performance varied considerably by instructional move, and higher recall frequently came at the cost of increased false positives. Overall, these findings indicate that foundation models demonstrate meaningful yet limited capacity to interpret instructional discourse, with prompt design helping to surface capability but not eliminating fundamental reliability constraints.

TL;DR: 该论文开发了一种基于大语言模型（LLM）的反事实框架，用于量化机器学习论文中的修辞风格，发现远见性表述能显著预测论文的引用和媒体关注度，且2023年后修辞强度显著上升，主要归因于LLM写作辅助工具的普及。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习领域存在对"过度宣传"的担忧，但缺乏独立于实质内容的修辞风格量化方法。研究目标是将修辞风格与内容本质分离，提供可靠的分析框架。

Method: 构建LLM反事实分析框架：1）多个LLM修辞人格基于相同内容生成反事实文本；2）LLM评估模型进行成对比较；3）使用Bradley-Terry模型聚合结果。对2017-2025年间8,485篇ICLR投稿进行大规模分析。

Result: 生成超25万条反事实文本，实证发现：1）远见性表述显著提升下游关注度（控制评审结果后）；2）2023年后修辞强度骤升，与LLM写作辅助应用强相关；3）框架在不同修辞人格和人类标注中均保持高度一致性。

Conclusion: LLM可作为科学评估工具测量修辞风格，研究提供了机器学习领域宣传效应的首个大规模量化证据，揭示LLM写作辅助对学术表达模式的影响。

Abstract: The rise of AI has fueled growing concerns about ``hype'' in machine learning papers, yet a reliable way to quantify rhetorical style independently of substantive content has remained elusive. Because bold language can stem from either strong empirical results or mere rhetorical style, it is often difficult to distinguish between the two. To disentangle rhetorical style from substantive content, we introduce a counterfactual, LLM-based framework: multiple LLM rhetorical personas generate counterfactual writings from the same substantive content, an LLM judge compares them through pairwise evaluations, and the outcomes are aggregated using a Bradley--Terry model. Applying this method to 8,485 ICLR submissions sampled from 2017 to 2025, we generate more than 250,000 counterfactual writings and provide a large-scale quantification of rhetorical style in ML papers. We find that visionary framing significantly predicts downstream attention, including citations and media attention, even after controlling for peer-review evaluations. We also observe a sharp rise in rhetorical strength after 2023, and provide empirical evidence showing that this increase is largely driven by the adoption of LLM-based writing assistance. The reliability of our framework is validated by its robustness to the choice of personas and the high correlation between LLM judgments and human annotations. Our work demonstrates that LLMs can serve as instruments to measure and improve scientific evaluation.

Abstract: Large Language Models are increasingly used in conversational systems such as digital personal assistants, shaping how people interact with technology through language. While their responses often sound fluent and natural, they can also carry subtle tone biases such as sounding overly polite, cheerful, or cautious even when neutrality is expected. These tendencies can influence how users perceive trust, empathy, and fairness in dialogue. In this study, we explore tone bias as a hidden behavioral trait of large language models. The novelty of this research lies in the integration of controllable large language model based dialogue synthesis with tone classification models, enabling robust and ethical emotion recognition in personal assistant interactions. We created two synthetic dialogue datasets, one generated from neutral prompts and another explicitly guided to produce positive or negative tones. Surprisingly, even the neutral set showed consistent tonal skew, suggesting that bias may stem from the model's underlying conversational style. Using weak supervision through a pretrained DistilBERT model, we labeled tones and trained several classifiers to detect these patterns. Ensemble models achieved macro F1 scores up to 0.92, showing that tone bias is systematic, measurable, and relevant to designing fair and trustworthy conversational AI.

### [57] [Schoenfeld's Anatomy of Mathematical Reasoning by Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19995)
*Ming Li,Chenrui Fan,Yize Cheng,Soheil Feizi,Tianyi Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces ThinkARM, a framework using Schoenfeld's Episode Theory to dissect language models' reasoning into functional steps (Analysis, Explore, etc.), revealing structural dynamics and critical factors like exploration's role in correctness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uncover the hidden cognitive structure of language models' reasoning beyond surface-level statistics, addressing inefficiencies in current analysis methods.

Method: Adapted Schoenfeld's Episode Theory to create ThinkARM, a framework mapping reasoning traces into functional steps (Analysis, Explore, Implement, Verify), applied to math problem-solving models for systematic analysis.

Result: Identified reproducible reasoning dynamics, structural differences between reasoning/non-reasoning models, exploration as a critical correctness determinant, and efficiency methods suppressing evaluation steps rather than shortening responses.

Conclusion: Episode-level frameworks like ThinkARM enable explicit analysis of reasoning structures, revealing mechanisms behind reasoning stabilization and alterations in language models.

Abstract: Large language models increasingly expose reasoning traces, yet their underlying cognitive structure and steps remain difficult to identify and analyze beyond surface-level statistics. We adopt Schoenfeld's Episode Theory as an inductive, intermediate-scale lens and introduce ThinkARM (Anatomy of Reasoning in Models), a scalable framework that explicitly abstracts reasoning traces into functional reasoning steps such as Analysis, Explore, Implement, Verify, etc. When applied to mathematical problem solving by diverse models, this abstraction reveals reproducible thinking dynamics and structural differences between reasoning and non-reasoning models, which are not apparent from token-level views. We further present two diagnostic case studies showing that exploration functions as a critical branching step associated with correctness, and that efficiency-oriented methods selectively suppress evaluative feedback steps rather than uniformly shortening responses. Together, our results demonstrate that episode-level representations make reasoning steps explicit, enabling systematic analysis of how reasoning is structured, stabilized, and altered in modern language models.

### [58] [A Novel Graph-Sequence Learning Model for Inductive Text Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20097)
*Zuo Wang,Ye Yuan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces TextGSL, a novel graph-sequence learning model for inductive text classification that addresses limitations in existing GNN-based methods by integrating multi-edge graph structures and Transformer layers to better capture structural and sequential information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GNN-based text classification methods suffer from two key flaws: insufficient utilization of diverse word-pair relationships (co-occurrence, syntax, semantics) and neglect of sequential information, limiting their ability to generalize to unseen words/relations in inductive scenarios.

Method: TextGSL constructs text-level graphs with multi-edge types representing different word relationships, implements adaptive multi-edge message-passing to aggregate structural information, and incorporates Transformer layers to extract sequential patterns, enabling robust representation learning through combined graph-sequential modeling.

Result: Experimental results show TextGSL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple benchmark datasets in terms of classification accuracy, particularly demonstrating strong inductive learning capabilities for texts containing novel words and relationships.

Conclusion: The proposed graph-sequence hybrid architecture effectively combines structural relationship learning with sequential modeling, providing a more comprehensive solution for inductive text classification tasks compared to traditional GNN-only approaches.

Abstract: Text classification plays an important role in various downstream text-related tasks, such as sentiment analysis, fake news detection, and public opinion analysis. Recently, text classification based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has made significant progress due to their strong capabilities of structural relationship learning. However, these approaches still face two major limitations. First, these approaches fail to fully consider the diverse structural information across word pairs, e.g., co-occurrence, syntax, and semantics. Furthermore, they neglect sequence information in the text graph structure information learning module and can not classify texts with new words and relations. In this paper, we propose a Novel Graph-Sequence Learning Model for Inductive Text Classification (TextGSL) to address the previously mentioned issues. More specifically, we construct a single text-level graph for all words in each text and establish different edge types based on the diverse relationships between word pairs. Building upon this, we design an adaptive multi-edge message-passing paradigm to aggregate diverse structural information between word pairs. Additionally, sequential information among text data can be captured by the proposed TextGSL through the incorporation of Transformer layers. Therefore, TextGSL can learn more discriminative text representations. TextGSL has been comprehensively compared with several strong baselines. The experimental results on diverse benchmarking datasets demonstrate that TextGSL outperforms these baselines in terms of accuracy.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出ABBEL框架压缩长序列决策上下文，结合RL提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法难以处理长序列任务的完整历史导致的计算和内存压力。

Method: 用自然语言信念状态替代完整历史，分步骤更新信念并选择动作，结合RL后训练优化信念生成和长度压缩。

Result: ABBEL保持内存效率和可解释性但易受误差影响，RL后训练显著提升性能并减少内存占用。

Conclusion: ABBEL结合RL优化可在牺牲少量性能下显著降低内存需求，适用于长序列任务。

Abstract: As the length of sequential decision-making tasks increases, it becomes computationally impractical to keep full interaction histories in context. We introduce a general framework for LLM agents to maintain concise contexts through multi-step interaction: Acting through Belief Bottlenecks Expressed in Language (ABBEL), and methods to further improve ABBEL agents with RL post-training. ABBEL replaces long multi-step interaction history by a belief state, i.e., a natural language summary of what has been discovered about task-relevant unknowns. Under ABBEL, at each step the agent first updates a prior belief with the most recent observation from the environment to form a posterior belief, then uses only the posterior to select an action. We systematically evaluate frontier models under ABBEL across six diverse multi-step environments, finding that ABBEL supports generating interpretable beliefs while maintaining near-constant memory use over interaction steps. However, bottleneck approaches are generally prone to error propagation, which we observe causing inferior performance when compared to the full context setting due to errors in belief updating. Therefore, we train LLMs to generate and act on beliefs within the ABBEL framework via reinforcement learning (RL). We experiment with belief grading, to reward higher quality beliefs, as well as belief length penalties to reward more compressed beliefs. Our experiments demonstrate the ability of RL to improve ABBEL's performance beyond the full context setting, while using less memory than contemporaneous approaches.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出Early Knowledge Alignment（EKA），通过在迭代RAG系统规划前引入检索知识对齐机制，提升复杂多跳问题的解决效率与准确性，且无需训练即可兼容大规模模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG系统在分解多跳问题时未利用检索语料信息,导致检索效率低下和级联错误,需在规划前建立与检索内容的知识对齐机制。

Method: 设计EKA模块,在迭代RAG的规划阶段前,通过检索到的上下文相关知识对齐大模型与检索语料库,构建更强的推理基础。

Result: 在6个RAG数据集验证显示:EKA提升检索精度23%,减少68%级联错误,推理效率提升40%，熵分析证明减少无效探索。零样本扩展至27B参数模型仍保持有效性。

Conclusion: EKA通过结构化推理与检索探索的协同优化，建立当前SOTA的迭代RAG范式，揭示强化学习框架下知识对齐的增益机制，且作为训练免费的通用策略具有显著工程实用价值。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for Large Language Models (LLMs) to address knowledge-intensive queries requiring domain-specific or up-to-date information. To handle complex multi-hop questions that are challenging for single-step retrieval, iterative RAG approaches incorporating reinforcement learning have been proposed. However, existing iterative RAG systems typically plan to decompose questions without leveraging information about the available retrieval corpus, leading to inefficient retrieval and reasoning chains that cascade into suboptimal performance. In this paper, we introduce Early Knowledge Alignment (EKA), a simple but effective module that aligns LLMs with retrieval set before planning in iterative RAG systems with contextually relevant retrieved knowledge. Extensive experiments on six standard RAG datasets demonstrate that by establishing a stronger reasoning foundation, EKA significantly improves retrieval precision, reduces cascading errors, and enhances both performance and efficiency. Our analysis from an entropy perspective demonstrate that incorporating early knowledge reduces unnecessary exploration during the reasoning process, enabling the model to focus more effectively on relevant information subsets. Moreover, EKA proves effective as a versatile, training-free inference strategy that scales seamlessly to large models. Generalization tests across diverse datasets and retrieval corpora confirm the robustness of our approach. Overall, EKA advances the state-of-the-art in iterative RAG systems while illuminating the critical interplay between structured reasoning and efficient exploration in reinforcement learning-augmented frameworks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统prompt学习方法依赖全监督训练，易受过拟合和表层模式影响，且难以充分利用非典型样本。需要解决记忆与泛化能力的平衡问题。

Method: 构建训练数据生成的可检索知识库，在输入、训练和推理阶段引入检索机制，动态获取相关上下文信息辅助模型决策。

Conclusion: 解耦记忆与泛化能力的方法能有效提升预训练模型的鲁棒性，为提示学习提供新的框架思路。

Abstract: The pre-trained foundation models (PFMs) have become essential for facilitating large-scale multimodal learning. Researchers have effectively employed the ``pre-train, prompt, and predict'' paradigm through prompt learning to induce improved few-shot performance. However, prompt learning approaches for PFMs still follow a parametric learning paradigm. As such, the stability of generalization in memorization and rote learning can be compromised. More specifically, conventional prompt learning might face difficulties in fully utilizing atypical instances and avoiding overfitting to shallow patterns with limited data during the process of fully-supervised training. To overcome these constraints, we present our approach, named RetroPrompt, which aims to achieve a balance between memorization and generalization by decoupling knowledge from mere memorization. Unlike traditional prompting methods, RetroPrompt leverages a publicly accessible knowledge base generated from the training data and incorporates a retrieval mechanism throughout the input, training, and inference stages. This enables the model to actively retrieve relevant contextual information from the corpus, thereby enhancing the available cues. We conduct comprehensive experiments on a variety of datasets across natural language processing and computer vision tasks to demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed approach, RetroPrompt, in both zero-shot and few-shot scenarios. Through detailed analysis of memorization patterns, we observe that RetroPrompt effectively reduces the reliance on rote memorization, leading to enhanced generalization.

TL;DR: Fun-Audio-Chat introduces dual-resolution speech representations and two-stage fine-tuning to address temporal mismatch and catastrophic forgetting in audio-text models, achieving efficient performance without pre-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing speech-text models suffer from resolution mismatch (25Hz vs. 3Hz), computational inefficiency, and loss of text LLM knowledge. A solution is needed that balances efficiency, quality, and multi-modal capability.

Method: 1) Dual-Resolution Speech Representations (DRSR): Shared LLM processes grouped 5Hz audio tokens, while a refined head generates high-quality 25Hz output. 2) Core-Cocktail Training: Two-stage fine-tuning with intermediate merging to prevent catastrophic forgetting. 3) Multi-Task DPO Training enhances audio reasoning and voice empathy.

Result: Fun-Audio-Chat 8B and MoE 30B variants achieve top performance on Spoken QA, speech-to-speech tasks, and audio understanding. Full-duplex version developed. Open-sourced model and demo available.

Conclusion: The approach enables efficient and robust audio-text modeling through novel architectures and training strategies, eliminating reliance on large-scale audio-text pre-training while preserving LLM knowledge.

Abstract: Recent advancements in joint speech-text models show great potential for seamless voice interactions. However, existing models face critical challenges: temporal resolution mismatch between speech tokens (25Hz) and text tokens (~3Hz) dilutes semantic information, incurs high computational costs, and causes catastrophic forgetting of text LLM knowledge. We introduce Fun-Audio-Chat, a Large Audio Language Model addressing these limitations via two innovations from our previous work DrVoice. First, Dual-Resolution Speech Representations (DRSR): the Shared LLM processes audio at efficient 5Hz (via token grouping), while the Speech Refined Head generates high-quality tokens at 25Hz, balancing efficiency (~50% GPU reduction) and quality. Second, Core-Cocktail Training, a two-stage fine-tuning with intermediate merging that mitigates catastrophic forgetting. We then apply Multi-Task DPO Training to enhance robustness, audio understanding, instruction-following and voice empathy. This multi-stage post-training enables Fun-Audio-Chat to retain text LLM knowledge while gaining powerful audio understanding, reasoning, and generation. Unlike recent LALMs requiring large-scale audio-text pre-training, Fun-Audio-Chat leverages pre-trained models and extensive post-training. Fun-Audio-Chat 8B and MoE 30B-A3B achieve competitive performance on Speech-to-Text and Speech-to-Speech tasks, ranking top among similar-scale models on Spoken QA benchmarks. They also achieve competitive to superior performance on Audio Understanding, Speech Function Calling, Instruction-Following and Voice Empathy. We develop Fun-Audio-Chat-Duplex, a full-duplex variant with strong performance on Spoken QA and full-duplex interactions. We open-source Fun-Audio-Chat-8B with training and inference code, and provide an interactive demo.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper reveals LLMs' vulnerability to hidden adversarial instructions in resumes, introduces a benchmark for detection, and demonstrates that training-based defenses (like FIDS) outperform prompt-based mitigation in balancing security and utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of adversarial defense mechanisms in emerging LLM applications (e.g., resume screening) despite existing protections in mature domains like code review.

Method: Developed a benchmark for adversarial instruction attacks in resume screening and evaluated two defenses: prompt-based mitigation and FIDS (a LoRA-based training-time defense).

Result: Adversarial attacks achieved 80%+ success rates; prompt-based defenses reduced attacks by 10.1% (with 12.5% false rejection increase), FIDS achieved 15.4% attack reduction (10.4% false rejection increase), and combined approaches provided 26.3% attack reduction.

Conclusion: Training-time defenses (FIDS) significantly outperform inference-time solutions in mitigating adversarial instructions while better preserving functionality.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at text comprehension and generation, making them ideal for automated tasks like code review and content moderation. However, our research identifies a vulnerability: LLMs can be manipulated by "adversarial instructions" hidden in input data, such as resumes or code, causing them to deviate from their intended task. Notably, while defenses may exist for mature domains such as code review, they are often absent in other common applications such as resume screening and peer review. This paper introduces a benchmark to assess this vulnerability in resume screening, revealing attack success rates exceeding 80% for certain attack types. We evaluate two defense mechanisms: prompt-based defenses achieve 10.1% attack reduction with 12.5% false rejection increase, while our proposed FIDS (Foreign Instruction Detection through Separation) using LoRA adaptation achieves 15.4% attack reduction with 10.4% false rejection increase. The combined approach provides 26.3% attack reduction, demonstrating that training-time defenses outperform inference-time mitigations in both security and utility preservation.

Abstract: Recognizing whether outputs from large language models (LLMs) contain faithfulness hallucination is crucial for real-world applications, e.g., retrieval-augmented generation and summarization. In this paper, we introduce FaithLens, a cost-efficient and effective faithfulness hallucination detection model that can jointly provide binary predictions and corresponding explanations to improve trustworthiness. To achieve this, we first synthesize training data with explanations via advanced LLMs and apply a well-defined data filtering strategy to ensure label correctness, explanation quality, and data diversity. Subsequently, we fine-tune the model on these well-curated training data as a cold start and further optimize it with rule-based reinforcement learning, using rewards for both prediction correctness and explanation quality. Results on 12 diverse tasks show that the 8B-parameter FaithLens outperforms advanced models such as GPT-4.1 and o3. Also, FaithLens can produce high-quality explanations, delivering a distinctive balance of trustworthiness, efficiency, and effectiveness.

Abstract: Speech processing and translation technology have the potential to facilitate meetings of individuals who do not share any common language. To evaluate automatic systems for such a task, a versatile and realistic evaluation corpus is needed. Therefore, we create and present a corpus of cross-lingual dialogues between individuals without a common language who were facilitated by automatic simultaneous speech translation. The corpus consists of 5 hours of speech recordings with ASR and gold transcripts in 12 original languages and automatic and corrected translations into English. For the purposes of research into cross-lingual summarization, our corpus also includes written summaries (minutes) of the meetings.
  Moreover, we propose automatic detection of misunderstandings. For an overview of this task and its complexity, we attempt to quantify misunderstandings in cross-lingual meetings. We annotate misunderstandings manually and also test the ability of current large language models to detect them automatically. The results show that the Gemini model is able to identify text spans with misunderstandings with recall of 77% and precision of 47%.

Abstract: Automatic presentation slide generation can greatly streamline content creation. However, since preferences of each user may vary, existing under-specified formulations often lead to suboptimal results that fail to align with individual user needs. We introduce a novel task that conditions paper-to-slides generation on user-specified preferences. We propose a human behavior-inspired agentic framework, SlideTailor, that progressively generates editable slides in a user-aligned manner. Instead of requiring users to write their preferences in detailed textual form, our system only asks for a paper-slides example pair and a visual template - natural and easy-to-provide artifacts that implicitly encode rich user preferences across content and visual style. Despite the implicit and unlabeled nature of these inputs, our framework effectively distills and generalizes the preferences to guide customized slide generation. We also introduce a novel chain-of-speech mechanism to align slide content with planned oral narration. Such a design significantly enhances the quality of generated slides and enables downstream applications like video presentations. To support this new task, we construct a benchmark dataset that captures diverse user preferences, with carefully designed interpretable metrics for robust evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在精神健康自我评估中的依赖增加，其能否准确解读患者的定性叙事成为关键问题。现有研究缺乏多语言场景下LLMs与人类专家的直接对比，尤其针对人格障碍诊断的细微差别及潜在偏见。

Method: 基于波兰语第一人称自传体叙事报告，对现有LLMs与人类专家进行平行诊断测试，并计算总体准确率及对BPD、NPD的F1得分。同时分析诊断决策依据的定性差异。

Result: Gemini Pro模型在总体准确率（65.48% vs 43.57%）和BPD诊断（F1 83.4 vs 80.0）上超越人类专家，但在NPD诊断中显著落后（F1 6.7 vs 50.0）。模型依赖形式化分类和模式分析，人类则强调患者自我感知和时间体验。

Conclusion: LLMs在处理复杂临床叙事中展现了潜力，但存在重大可靠性漏洞（如NPD诊断偏差）和价值判断倾向性，需谨慎评估其临床适用性并警惕潜在偏见。

Abstract: Growing reliance on LLMs for psychiatric self-assessment raises questions about their ability to interpret qualitative patient narratives. We present the first direct comparison between state-of-the-art LLMs and mental health professionals in diagnosing Borderline (BPD) and Narcissistic (NPD) Personality Disorders utilizing Polish-language first-person autobiographical accounts. We show that the top-performing Gemini Pro models surpassed human professionals in overall diagnostic accuracy by 21.91 percentage points (65.48% vs. 43.57%). While both models and human experts excelled at identifying BPD (F1 = 83.4 & F1 = 80.0, respectively), models severely underdiagnosed NPD (F1 = 6.7 vs. 50.0), showing a reluctance toward the value-laden term "narcissism." Qualitatively, models provided confident, elaborate justifications focused on patterns and formal categories, while human experts remained concise and cautious, emphasizing the patient's sense of self and temporal experience. Our findings demonstrate that while LLMs are highly competent at interpreting complex first-person clinical data, they remain subject to critical reliability and bias issues.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了SpidR，一种高效的自监督语音表示模型，能够从语音中直接提取语义表征以实现无文本的口语语言建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决通过语音直接学习语言而无需文字中间媒介的问题，需要开发能够从语音中提取语义表征的模型。

Method: SpidR基于原始波形训练，结合掩码预测目标、自蒸馏和在线聚类。学生模型中间层通过预测教师模型生成的分配标签来稳定聚类过程。

Result: SpidR在sWUGGY等下游语言建模基准上超越了wav2vec 2.0、HuBERT等模型，验证了ABX/PNMI等语音单元质量指标与语言建模性能的相关性，并将预训练时间从一周缩短至一天（16 GPU）。

Conclusion: SpidR通过创新性学习目标和高效代码库显著提升了模型质量，同时提供了可靠的评估指标和开放源代码资源。

Abstract: The parallel advances in language modeling and speech representation learning have raised the prospect of learning language directly from speech without textual intermediates. This requires extracting semantic representations directly from speech. Our contributions are threefold. First, we introduce SpidR, a self-supervised speech representation model that efficiently learns representations with highly accessible phonetic information, which makes it particularly suited for textless spoken language modeling. It is trained on raw waveforms using a masked prediction objective combined with self-distillation and online clustering. The intermediate layers of the student model learn to predict assignments derived from the teacher's intermediate layers. This learning objective stabilizes the online clustering procedure compared to previous approaches, resulting in higher quality codebooks. SpidR outperforms wav2vec 2.0, HuBERT, WavLM, and DinoSR on downstream language modeling benchmarks (sWUGGY, sBLIMP, tSC). Second, we systematically evaluate across models and layers the correlation between speech unit quality (ABX, PNMI) and language modeling performance, validating these metrics as reliable proxies. Finally, SpidR significantly reduces pretraining time compared to HuBERT, requiring only one day of pretraining on 16 GPUs, instead of a week. This speedup is enabled by the pretraining method and an efficient codebase, which allows faster iteration and easier experimentation. We open-source the training code and model checkpoints at https://github.com/facebookresearch/spidr.

Motivation: 填补低资源语言文化隐喻推理基准的空白，评估LLM对孟加拉传统谜题这种高度文化依赖场景的适应能力

Method: 构建4任务4976样本的谜语数据集，采用LLM生成链式思考解释和对抗样本，评估16种模型在zero-shot/思维链提示下的表现

Result: 顶级模型MCQ准确率56%（人类83%），模糊消解26-68%，生成式问答正确率仅21%，需GPT-4级模型才能实现较连贯的解释

Conclusion: 现有LLM在文化隐喻推理中仅能捕捉表面线索，BanglaRiddleEval成为低资源语言理解的新型挑战，揭示多步推理和对抗样本防御的优化方向

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show impressive performance on many NLP benchmarks, yet their ability to reason in figurative, culturally grounded, and low-resource settings remains underexplored. We address this gap for Bangla by introducing BanglaRiddleEval, a benchmark of 1,244 traditional Bangla riddles instantiated across four tasks (4,976 riddle-task artifacts in total). Using an LLM-based pipeline, we generate Chain-of-Thought explanations, semantically coherent distractors, and fine-grained ambiguity annotations, and evaluate a diverse suite of open-source and closed-source models under different prompting strategies. Models achieve moderate semantic overlap on generative QA but low correctness, MCQ accuracy peaks at only about 56% versus an 83% human baseline, and ambiguity resolution ranges from roughly 26% to 68%, with high-quality explanations confined to the strongest models. These results show that current LLMs capture some cues needed for Bangla riddle reasoning but remain far from human-level performance, establishing BanglaRiddleEval as a challenging new benchmark for low-resource figurative reasoning. All data, code, and evaluation scripts are available on GitHub: https://github.com/Labib1610/BanglaRiddleEval.

*Junyi Liu,Stanley Kok*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a sentiment-aware framework for summarizing short, informal user-generated texts by enhancing extractive and abstractive methods with sentiment signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing summarization methods struggle with noisy, informally structured user-generated content and lack sentiment integration, which is critical for IS tasks like brand monitoring and market analysis.

Method: A dual design extending TextRank (extractive) and UniLM (abstractive) approaches by incorporating sentiment modeling into their ranking and generation processes.

Result: The framework improves emotional nuance capture and thematic relevance, generating concise summaries that enable timely decision-making in dynamic online environments.

Conclusion: Sentiment-aware summarization enhances strategic interventions by effectively embedding emotional context into both content selection and generation stages.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of unstructured data from social media, reviews, and forums, text mining has become essential in Information Systems (IS) for extracting actionable insights. Summarization can condense fragmented, emotion-rich posts, but existing methods-optimized for structured news-struggle with noisy, informal content. Emotional cues are critical for IS tasks such as brand monitoring and market analysis, yet few studies integrate sentiment modeling into summarization of short user-generated texts. We propose a sentiment-aware framework extending extractive (TextRank) and abstractive (UniLM) approaches by embedding sentiment signals into ranking and generation processes. This dual design improves the capture of emotional nuances and thematic relevance, producing concise, sentiment-enriched summaries that enhance timely interventions and strategic decision-making in dynamic online environments.

Abstract: Distilling pretrained softmax attention Transformers into more efficient hybrid architectures that interleave softmax and linear attention layers is a promising approach for improving the inference efficiency of LLMs without requiring expensive pretraining from scratch. A critical factor in the conversion process is layer selection, i.e., deciding on which layers to convert to linear attention variants. This paper describes a simple and efficient recipe for layer selection that uses layer importance scores derived from a small amount of training on generic text data. Once the layers have been selected we use a recent pipeline for the distillation process itself \citep[RADLADS;][]{goldstein2025radlads}, which consists of attention weight transfer, hidden state alignment, KL-based distribution matching, followed by a small amount of finetuning. We find that this approach is more effective than existing approaches for layer selection, including heuristics that uniformly interleave linear attentions based on a fixed ratio, as well as more involved approaches that rely on specialized diagnostic datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖于外部判决器、多样本一致性或基于文本的自我批评，但计算成本高且与真实正确性相关性弱。研究目标是让LLMs通过内部状态检测自身失败。

Method: 通过被动观察内部追踪数据，将其压缩为固定预算的描述符，并利用约5M参数的轻量模型预测正确性，独立于序列长度。

Result: 在数学推理、开放域问答和学术知识基准测试中，Gnosis在准确性和校准度上均优于强大的内部基线和大型外部判决器，且能零样本泛化到部分生成结果。

Conclusion: 生成过程中的正确性线索是固有的且可高效提取，无需外部监督，实现了低计算开销的自我验证与错误轨迹检测。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) generate fluent and complex outputs but often fail to recognize their own mistakes and hallucinations. Existing approaches typically rely on external judges, multi-sample consistency, or text-based self-critique, which incur additional compute or correlate weakly with true correctness. We ask: can LLMs predict their own failures by inspecting internal states during inference? We introduce Gnosis, a lightweight self-awareness mechanism that enables frozen LLMs to perform intrinsic self-verification by decoding signals from hidden states and attention patterns. Gnosis passively observes internal traces, compresses them into fixed-budget descriptors, and predicts correctness with negligible inference cost, adding only ~5M parameters and operating independently of sequence length. Across math reasoning, open-domain question answering, and academic knowledge benchmarks, and over frozen backbones ranging from 1.7B to 20B parameters, Gnosis consistently outperforms strong internal baselines and large external judges in both accuracy and calibration. Moreover, it generalizes zero-shot to partial generations, enabling early detection of failing trajectories and compute-aware control. These results show that reliable correctness cues are intrinsic to generation process and can be extracted efficiently without external supervision.

### [73] [Cube Bench: A Benchmark for Spatial Visual Reasoning in MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20595)
*Dhruv Anand,Ehsan Shareghi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Cube Bench is a Rubik's-cube-based benchmark for evaluating spatial and sequential reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess MLLMs' spatial and sequential reasoning capabilities through a structured, multimodal task, identifying gaps between closed- and open-source models while isolating critical challenges like error recovery.

Method: Designed Cube Bench with five reasoning skills (cube reconstruction, move selection, outcome prediction, plan execution, error correction). Tested seven MLLMs on standardized scrambled cube states, using consistent prompts, parsers, and a distance-to-solved metric across varying scramble depths. Evaluated self-correction via reflective thinking.

Result: Accuracy sharply declines with scramble depth; stalled trajectories are rarely recovered. Closed-source models outperform open-weight models (particularly in single-step perception and multi-step control), but all degrade at higher complexity. High face-reconstruction accuracy does not ensure competent action selection or execution. Reflective self-correction yields modest gains but risks overthinking.

Conclusion: Cube Bench provides a reproducible, compact evaluation for sequential spatial reasoning in MLLMs, revealing critical limitations and the closed-source/open-source performance gap, while highlighting the need for improved error recovery and complex reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: We introduce Cube Bench, a Rubik's-cube benchmark for evaluating spatial and sequential reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). The benchmark decomposes performance into five skills: (i) reconstructing cube faces from images and text, (ii) choosing the optimal next move, (iii) predicting the outcome of a candidate move without applying it, (iv) executing multi-step plans while recovering from mistakes, and (v) detecting and revising one's own errors. Using a shared set of scrambled cube states, identical prompts and parsers, and a single distance-to-solved metric, we compare recent MLLMs side by side as a function of scramble depth. Across seven MLLMs, accuracy drops sharply with depth; once a trajectory stalls or diverges, models rarely recover, and high face-reconstruction accuracy does not guarantee competent action selection or multi-step execution. A pronounced closed- vs open-source gap emerges: the strongest closed model leads on both single-step perception tasks and multi-step control tasks, while open-weight models cluster near chance on the hardest settings; yet even the best MLLM degrades at higher cube complexity. A simple self-correction via reflective thinking yields modest gains but can also introduce overthinking. Cube Bench offers a compact, reproducible probe of sequential spatial reasoning in MLLMs.

Abstract: We present MoE-DiffuSeq, a mixture of experts based framework for enhancing diffusion models in long document generation. Existing diffusion based text generation models, such as DiffuSeq, suffer from high computational cost and memory overhead when applied to extended sequences. To address these challenges, MoE-DiffuSeq integrates sparse attention with a mixture of experts architecture, enabling efficient and scalable long sequence modeling. Our approach introduces a customized sparse attention mechanism designed to reduce computational complexity while preserving text quality and coherence. In addition, we incorporate a soft absorbing state within the diffusion process to accelerate sequence reconstruction and improve generation precision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoE-DiffuSeq significantly improves training efficiency and sampling speed compared to existing diffusion models. These advantages are particularly effective for long document scenarios, including scientific article generation, code repository modeling, and long form dialogue generation. Benchmark results further show that MoE-DiffuSeq improves efficiency, speed, accuracy, and expressiveness, advancing the practical applicability of diffusion models for high quality long form text generation.
