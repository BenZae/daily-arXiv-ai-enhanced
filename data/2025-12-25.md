### [1] [VL4Gaze: Unleashing Vision-Language Models for Gaze Following](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20735)
*Shijing Wang,Chaoqun Cui,Yaping Huang,Hyung Jin Chang,Yihua Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了VL4Gaze——首个用于评估和提升视觉-语言模型（VLM）对注视理解能力的大规模基准数据集。 VL4Gaze包含489K个问答对，涵盖四大任务：注视物体描述、注视方向描述、注视点定位和模糊问题识别。实验表明任务特定监督显著提升模型表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态模型缺乏针对注视理解的系统性评估框架，且未知通用视觉-语言预训练能否自发产生注视理解能力。

Method: 构建包含124K图像、489K自动标注问答对的VL4Gaze数据集，设计四大互补性任务并通过上下文学习和微调验证模型性能。

Result: 主流VLM在无任务特定监督时难以可靠推理注视语义与空间定位；引入VL4Gaze训练后各任务表现均显著提升。

Conclusion: 视觉-语言模型需针对性多任务监督才能发展注视理解能力，研究团队承诺开源数据集与代码推动后续研究。

Abstract: Human gaze provides essential cues for interpreting attention, intention, and social interaction in visual scenes, yet gaze understanding remains largely unexplored in current vision-language models (VLMs). While recent VLMs achieve strong scene-level reasoning across a range of visual tasks, there exists no benchmark that systematically evaluates or trains them for gaze interpretation, leaving open the question of whether gaze understanding can emerge from general-purpose vision-language pre-training. To address this gap, we introduce VL4Gaze, the first large-scale benchmark designed to investigate, evaluate, and unlock the potential of VLMs for gaze understanding. VL4Gaze contains 489K automatically generated question-answer pairs across 124K images and formulates gaze understanding as a unified VQA problem through four complementary tasks: (1) gaze object description, (2) gaze direction description, (3) gaze point location, and (4) ambiguous question recognition. We comprehensively evaluate both commercial and open-source VLMs under in-context learning and fine-tuning settings. The results show that even large-scale VLMs struggle to reliably infer gaze semantics and spatial localization without task-specific supervision. In contrast, training on VL4Gaze brings substantial and consistent improvements across all tasks, highlighting the importance of targeted multi-task supervision for developing gaze understanding capabilities in VLMs. We will release the dataset and code to support further research and development in this direction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了OccuFly基准，首个基于相机的空中语义场景补全（SSC）数据集，涵盖不同季节与场景，无需依赖LiDAR。其通过传统3D重建技术减少人工标注，并评估了现有方法在空中视角下的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SSC研究主要集中于地面场景（如自动驾驶），而空中场景（如无人机）缺乏研究且受限于LiDAR传感器的法规、质量及点云稀疏性。

Method: 采用相机模态构建数据集，利用传统3D重建技术，通过提升2D标注掩码到点云实现标注自动化，覆盖春、夏、秋、冬不同季节及不同地形。

Result: 提供包含22类语义的Urban、工业、农村场景数据，实验证明空中视角存在独特挑战（如高视角点云稀疏性），并建立首个无LiDAR的空中SSC基准。

Conclusion: OccuFly填补了空中SSC基准的空白，推动无人机在3D场景理解的应用，同时揭示了空中视角下SSC任务的核心挑战与解决方案方向。

Abstract: Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) is crucial for 3D perception in mobile robotics, as it enables holistic scene understanding by jointly estimating dense volumetric occupancy and per-voxel semantics. Although SSC has been widely studied in terrestrial domains such as autonomous driving, aerial scenarios like autonomous flying remain largely unexplored, thereby limiting progress on downstream applications. Furthermore, LiDAR sensors represent the primary modality for SSC data generation, which poses challenges for most uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) due to flight regulations, mass and energy constraints, and the sparsity of LiDAR-based point clouds from elevated viewpoints. To address these limitations, we introduce OccuFly, the first real-world, camera-based aerial SSC benchmark, captured at altitudes of 50m, 40m, and 30m during spring, summer, fall, and winter. OccuFly covers urban, industrial, and rural scenarios, provides 22 semantic classes, and the data format adheres to established conventions to facilitate seamless integration with existing research. Crucially, we propose a LiDAR-free data generation framework based on camera modality, which is ubiquitous on modern UAVs. By utilizing traditional 3D reconstruction, our framework automates label transfer by lifting a subset of annotated 2D masks into the reconstructed point cloud, thereby substantially minimizing manual 3D annotation effort. Finally, we benchmark the state-of-the-art on OccuFly and highlight challenges specific to elevated viewpoints, yielding a comprehensive vision benchmark for holistic aerial 3D scene understanding.

### [3] [NULLBUS: Multimodal Mixed-Supervision for Breast Ultrasound Segmentation via Nullable Global-Local Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20783)
*Raja Mallina,Bryar Shareef*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为NullBUS的多模态混合监督框架，通过可空提示处理缺失文本元数据问题，在乳腺超声分割任务中实现了当前最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的提示可训练方法需要文本或空间提示提升分割效果，但公共乳腺超声数据集常缺乏可靠文本元数据，导致训练受限；需开发一种能同时处理带提示和无提示数据的统一模型。

Method: 引入可空提示机制（nullable prompts），采用学习型空嵌入与存在掩码联合表征，实现文本缺失时回退至纯图像证据，文本存在时融合多模态信息；构建混合监督训练框架整合两类数据。

Result: 在三个公共乳腺超声数据集合并数据库验证，取得0.8568均交并比（IoU）和0.9103均Dice系数，证明在混合提示可用性条件下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: NullBUS通过可空提示机制有效解决医学影像分析中元数据缺失问题，为多模态学习在实际场景中的鲁棒应用提供新范式。

Abstract: Breast ultrasound (BUS) segmentation provides lesion boundaries essential for computer-aided diagnosis and treatment planning. While promptable methods can improve segmentation performance and tumor delineation when text or spatial prompts are available, many public BUS datasets lack reliable metadata or reports, constraining training to small multimodal subsets and reducing robustness. We propose NullBUS, a multimodal mixed-supervision framework that learns from images with and without prompts in a single model. To handle missing text, we introduce nullable prompts, implemented as learnable null embeddings with presence masks, enabling fallback to image-only evidence when metadata are absent and the use of text when present. Evaluated on a unified pool of three public BUS datasets, NullBUS achieves a mean IoU of 0.8568 and a mean Dice of 0.9103, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance under mixed prompt availability.

### [4] [Learning to Sense for Driving: Joint Optics-Sensor-Model Co-Design for Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20815)
*Reeshad Khan amd John Gauch*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes an end-to-end co-design framework for autonomous driving perception, integrating camera optics, sensor modeling, and lightweight neural networks to optimize machine-centric image processing instead of human-centric pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional camera designs for autonomous driving focus on human-viewable imagery, leading to irreversible information loss during preprocessing steps (e.g., demosaicing) and forcing perception models to adapt to sensor artifacts. The separation of camera and perception modules limits efficiency and accuracy.

Method: The framework co-designs optics, sensor components (e.g., color filter arrays), and lightweight segmentation networks into a unified RAW-to-task pipeline. It uses learnable parameters for sensor modeling (e.g., Poisson-Gaussian noise, quantization) and optimizes the entire system on segmentation objectives via end-to-end training, building on the DeepLens platform.

Result: On KITTI-360, the co-design approach improved segmentation accuracy (mIoU) compared to fixed pipelines, with notable gains in handling edge/low-light conditions. A compact model (~1M parameters, 28 FPS) demonstrated robustness against blur, noise, and low bit-depth, enabling edge deployment.

Conclusion: End-to-end co-optimization of optics, sensors, and networks outperforms traditional decoupled pipelines, offering a scalable and efficient path for deploying autonomous systems with enhanced perceptual reliability under challenging real-world conditions.

Abstract: Traditional autonomous driving pipelines decouple camera design from downstream perception, relying on fixed optics and handcrafted ISPs that prioritize human viewable imagery rather than machine semantics. This separation discards information during demosaicing, denoising, or quantization, while forcing models to adapt to sensor artifacts. We present a task-driven co-design framework that unifies optics, sensor modeling, and lightweight semantic segmentation networks into a single end-to-end RAW-to-task pipeline. Building on DeepLens[19], our system integrates realistic cellphone-scale lens models, learnable color filter arrays, Poisson-Gaussian noise processes, and quantization, all optimized directly for segmentation objectives. Evaluations on KITTI-360 show consistent mIoU improvements over fixed pipelines, with optics modeling and CFA learning providing the largest gains, especially for thin or low-light-sensitive classes. Importantly, these robustness gains are achieved with a compact ~1M-parameter model running at ~28 FPS, demonstrating edge deployability. Visual and quantitative analyses further highlight how co-designed sensors adapt acquisition to semantic structure, sharpening boundaries and maintaining accuracy under blur, noise, and low bit-depth. Together, these findings establish full-stack co-optimization of optics, sensors, and networks as a principled path toward efficient, reliable, and deployable perception in autonomous systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CHAMMI-75是一个开放获取的多通道显微图像数据集，包含来自75项不同生物研究的数据，旨在训练具有通道自适应能力的细胞形态学分析模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有细胞形态定量模型通常依赖单一显微镜成像类型，导致模型无法跨研究通用，主要原因包括成像通道数不匹配或实验条件分布外。需要解决模型泛化性不足的问题。

Method: 从公开资源中整理75项生物研究的异构多通道显微图像数据集（CHAMMI-75），通过实验证明使用该数据集训练的模型在多通道生物成像任务中的性能提升主要源于其显微成像模态的多样性。

Result: 使用CHAMMI-75训练显著提升了多通道生物成像任务的模型性能，验证了数据集中成像模态多样性对模型优化的关键作用。

Conclusion: CHAMMI-75为开发下一代可跨生物研究复用的细胞形态分析模型提供了关键资源，推动无需匹配成像条件的细胞形态学研究。

Abstract: Quantifying cell morphology using images and machine learning has proven to be a powerful tool to study the response of cells to treatments. However, models used to quantify cellular morphology are typically trained with a single microscopy imaging type. This results in specialized models that cannot be reused across biological studies because the technical specifications do not match (e.g., different number of channels), or because the target experimental conditions are out of distribution. Here, we present CHAMMI-75, an open access dataset of heterogeneous, multi-channel microscopy images from 75 diverse biological studies. We curated this resource from publicly available sources to investigate cellular morphology models that are channel-adaptive and can process any microscopy image type. Our experiments show that training with CHAMMI-75 can improve performance in multi-channel bioimaging tasks primarily because of its high diversity in microscopy modalities. This work paves the way to create the next generation of cellular morphology models for biological studies.

### [6] [Input-Adaptive Visual Preprocessing for Efficient Fast Vision-Language Model Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20839)
*Putu Indah Githa Cahyani,Komang David Dananjaya Suartana,Novanto Yudistira*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种自适应视觉预处理方法减少VLM推理时间，效率提升50%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统VLM因静态视觉预处理导致高分辨率图像处理时冗余计算，推断延迟高

Method: 结合内容感知分析、动态分辨率选择和自适应裁剪，在FastVLM框架下无架构修改实现轻量化预处理

Result: 单图像推理时间下降50%，生成时间缩短，视觉token减少55%，效率指标显著提升

Conclusion: 输入感知预处理可有效提升VLM部署效率，代码已开源

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on multimodal reasoning tasks, but their deployment remains challenging due to high inference latency and computational cost, particularly when processing high-resolution visual inputs. While recent architectures such as FastVLM improve efficiency through optimized vision encoders, existing pipelines still rely on static visual preprocessing, leading to redundant computation for visually simple inputs. In this work, we propose an adaptive visual preprocessing method that dynamically adjusts input resolution and spatial coverage based on image content characteristics. The proposed approach combines content-aware image analysis, adaptive resolution selection, and content-aware cropping to reduce visual redundancy prior to vision encoding. Importantly, the method is integrated with FastVLM without modifying its architecture or requiring retraining. We evaluate the proposed method on a subset of the DocVQA dataset in an inference-only setting, focusing on efficiency-oriented metrics. Experimental results show that adaptive preprocessing reduces per-image inference time by over 50\%, lowers mean full generation time, and achieves a consistent reduction of more than 55\% in visual token count compared to the baseline pipeline. These findings demonstrate that input-aware preprocessing is an effective and lightweight strategy for improving deployment-oriented efficiency of vision-language models. To facilitate reproducibility, our implementation is provided as a fork of the FastVLM repository, incorporating the files for the proposed method, and is available at https://github.com/kmdavidds/mlfastlm.

TL;DR: ALIVE系统通过本地化部署的AI多模态交互和内容感知检索技术，将传统录播讲座转化为实时互动学习体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统录播视频缺乏实时答疑机制，而现有互动学习系统存在讲座内容理解不足、云服务依赖性强、检索与虚拟人解释整合度低等问题。ALIVE旨在解决这些技术局限，通过一体化框架实现隐私保护的实时互动学习场景。

Conclusion: ALIVE证明了多模态AI与内容感知检索的有机结合能显著提升录播课程的教学价值，展示了基于本地化部署的智能教育交互范式的发展潜力，为下一代互动学习环境提供了可扩展的技术路径

Abstract: Traditional lecture videos offer flexibility but lack mechanisms for real-time clarification, forcing learners to search externally when confusion arises. Recent advances in large language models and neural avatars provide new opportunities for interactive learning, yet existing systems typically lack lecture awareness, rely on cloud-based services, or fail to integrate retrieval and avatar-delivered explanations in a unified, privacy-preserving pipeline.
  We present ALIVE, an Avatar-Lecture Interactive Video Engine that transforms passive lecture viewing into a dynamic, real-time learning experience. ALIVE operates fully on local hardware and integrates (1) Avatar-delivered lecture generated through ASR transcription, LLM refinement, and neural talking-head synthesis; (2) A content-aware retrieval mechanism that combines semantic similarity with timestamp alignment to surface contextually relevant lecture segments; and (3) Real-time multimodal interaction, enabling students to pause the lecture, ask questions through text or voice, and receive grounded explanations either as text or as avatar-delivered responses.
  To maintain responsiveness, ALIVE employs lightweight embedding models, FAISS-based retrieval, and segmented avatar synthesis with progressive preloading. We demonstrate the system on a complete medical imaging course, evaluate its retrieval accuracy, latency characteristics, and user experience, and show that ALIVE provides accurate, content-aware, and engaging real-time support.
  ALIVE illustrates how multimodal AI-when combined with content-aware retrieval and local deployment-can significantly enhance the pedagogical value of recorded lectures, offering an extensible pathway toward next-generation interactive learning environments.

Abstract: To address the issues of weak correlation between multi-view features, low recognition accuracy of small-scale targets, and insufficient robustness in complex scenarios in underground pipeline detection using 3D GPR, this paper proposes a 3D pipeline intelligent detection framework. First, based on a B/C/D-Scan three-view joint analysis strategy, a three-dimensional pipeline three-view feature evaluation method is established by cross-validating forward simulation results obtained using FDTD methods with actual measurement data. Second, the DCO-YOLO framework is proposed, which integrates DySample, CGLU, and OutlookAttention cross-dimensional correlation mechanisms into the original YOLOv11 algorithm, significantly improving the small-scale pipeline edge feature extraction capability. Furthermore, a 3D-DIoU spatial feature matching algorithm is proposed, which integrates three-dimensional geometric constraints and center distance penalty terms to achieve automated association of multi-view annotations. The three-view fusion strategy resolves inherent ambiguities in single-view detection. Experiments based on real urban underground pipeline data show that the proposed method achieves accuracy, recall, and mean average precision of 96.2%, 93.3%, and 96.7%, respectively, in complex multi-pipeline scenarios, which are 2.0%, 2.1%, and 0.9% higher than the baseline model. Ablation experiments validated the synergistic optimization effect of the dynamic feature enhancement module and Grad-CAM++ heatmap visualization demonstrated that the improved model significantly enhanced its ability to focus on pipeline geometric features. This study integrates deep learning optimization strategies with the physical characteristics of 3D GPR, offering an efficient and reliable novel technical framework for the intelligent recognition and localization of underground pipelines.

### [9] [NeRV360: Neural Representation for 360-Degree Videos with a Viewport Decoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20871)
*Daichi Arai,Kyohei Unno,Yasuko Sugito,Yuichi Kusakabe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NeRV360是一个端到端框架，通过仅解码用户选择的视口而非整个全景帧，有效提升高分辨率360度视频的压缩效率，解决内存占用高和解码速度慢的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统NeRV在高分辨率360度视频中存在内存消耗高、解码速度慢的缺陷，限制了实时应用的发展。

Method: NeRV360将视口提取整合至解码过程，并引入时空仿射变换模块，基于视角和时间进行条件解码，实现选择性解码。

Result: 实验显示，相比HNeRV，NeRV360内存消耗降低7倍，解码速度提升2.5倍，且图像质量（客观指标）更优。

Conclusion: NeRV360通过视口驱动解码策略与时空建模，显著优化360度视频压缩效率与质量，适用于实时应用。

Abstract: Implicit neural representations for videos (NeRV) have shown strong potential for video compression. However, applying NeRV to high-resolution 360-degree videos causes high memory usage and slow decoding, making real-time applications impractical. We propose NeRV360, an end-to-end framework that decodes only the user-selected viewport instead of reconstructing the entire panoramic frame. Unlike conventional pipelines, NeRV360 integrates viewport extraction into decoding and introduces a spatial-temporal affine transform module for conditional decoding based on viewpoint and time. Experiments on 6K-resolution videos show that NeRV360 achieves a 7-fold reduction in memory consumption and a 2.5-fold increase in decoding speed compared to HNeRV, a representative prior work, while delivering better image quality in terms of objective metrics.

Conclusion: 通过特征空间优化的DRI策略可有效解决模态差异问题，为轻量模型提供新范式，同时代码开源推动后续研究。

Abstract: Cross-Modality Ship Re-Identification (CMS Re-ID) is critical for achieving all-day and all-weather maritime target tracking, yet it is fundamentally challenged by significant modality discrepancies. Mainstream solutions typically rely on explicit modality alignment strategies; however, this paradigm heavily depends on constructing large-scale paired datasets for pre-training. To address this, grounded in the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, we explore the potential of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) in bridging modality gaps. Recognizing the suboptimal performance of existing generic Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods that operate within the weight space, particularly on limited-capacity models, we shift the optimization perspective to the feature space and propose a novel PEFT strategy termed Domain Representation Injection (DRI). Specifically, while keeping the VFM fully frozen to maximize the preservation of general knowledge, we design a lightweight, learnable Offset Encoder to extract domain-specific representations rich in modality and identity attributes from raw inputs. Guided by the contextual information of intermediate features at different layers, a Modulator adaptively transforms these representations. Subsequently, they are injected into the intermediate layers via additive fusion, dynamically reshaping the feature distribution to adapt to the downstream task without altering the VFM's pre-trained weights. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method, achieving State-of-the-Art (SOTA) performance with minimal trainable parameters. For instance, on the HOSS-ReID dataset, we attain 57.9\% and 60.5\% mAP using only 1.54M and 7.05M parameters, respectively. The code is available at https://github.com/TingfengXian/DRI.

Abstract: Lung cancer continues to be the leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally. Early detection and diagnosis of pulmonary nodules are essential for improving patient survival rates. Although previous research has integrated multimodal and multi-temporal information, outperforming single modality and single time point, the fusion methods are limited to inefficient vector concatenation and simple mutual attention, highlighting the need for more effective multimodal information fusion. To address these challenges, we introduce a Dual-Graph Spatiotemporal Attention Network, which leverages temporal variations and multimodal data to enhance the accuracy of predictions. Our methodology involves developing a Global-Local Feature Encoder to better capture the local, global, and fused characteristics of pulmonary nodules. Additionally, a Dual-Graph Construction method organizes multimodal features into inter-modal and intra-modal graphs. Furthermore, a Hierarchical Cross-Modal Graph Fusion Module is introduced to refine feature integration. We also compiled a novel multimodal dataset named the NLST-cmst dataset as a comprehensive source of support for related research. Our extensive experiments, conducted on both the NLST-cmst and curated CSTL-derived datasets, demonstrate that our DGSAN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in classifying pulmonary nodules with exceptional computational efficiency.

Conclusion: 为低比特率图像输入场景下的VLM优化提供了可复用的基准框架和普适性解决方案，揭示了压缩图像与视觉-语言理解间的新兴研究方向

Abstract: With the rapid development of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and the growing demand for their applications, efficient compression of the image inputs has become increasingly important. Existing VLMs predominantly digest and understand high-bitrate compressed images, while their ability to interpret low-bitrate compressed images has yet to be explored by far. In this paper, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark to evaluate the ability of VLM against compressed images, varying existing widely used image codecs and diverse set of tasks, encompassing over one million compressed images in our benchmark. Next, we analyse the source of performance gap, by categorising the gap from a) the information loss during compression and b) generalisation failure of VLM. We visualize these gaps with concrete examples and identify that for compressed images, only the generalization gap can be mitigated. Finally, we propose a universal VLM adaptor to enhance model performance on images compressed by existing codecs. Consequently, we demonstrate that a single adaptor can improve VLM performance across images with varying codecs and bitrates by 10%-30%. We believe that our benchmark and enhancement method provide valuable insights and contribute toward bridging the gap between VLMs and compressed images.

Abstract: 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) is a critical bridge from vision-language perception to robotics, requiring both language understanding and 3D scene reasoning. Traditional supervised models leverage explicit 3D geometry but exhibit limited generalization, owing to the scarcity of 3D vision-language datasets and the limited reasoning capabilities compared to modern vision-language models (VLMs). We propose PanoGrounder, a generalizable 3DVG framework that couples multi-modal panoramic representation with pretrained 2D VLMs for strong vision-language reasoning. Panoramic renderings, augmented with 3D semantic and geometric features, serve as an intermediate representation between 2D and 3D, and offer two major benefits: (i) they can be directly fed to VLMs with minimal adaptation and (ii) they retain long-range object-to-object relations thanks to their 360-degree field of view. We devise a three-stage pipeline that places a compact set of panoramic viewpoints considering the scene layout and geometry, grounds a text query on each panoramic rendering with a VLM, and fuses per-view predictions into a single 3D bounding box via lifting. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on ScanRefer and Nr3D, and demonstrates superior generalization to unseen 3D datasets and text rephrasings.

Motivation: 现有视觉编程方法依赖固定或推测性工具集，导致程序次优且工具利用率低，需探索基于经验的动态工具构建方法。

Method: TVP结合解题与经验积累：先用基础工具解题并收录方案至示例库，再从中抽象高频模式生成可复用的高阶工具。

Conclusion: 经验驱动的归纳工具创建范式可有效解决复杂空间推理问题，并形成具备自演化能力的视觉编程系统。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning in 3D scenes requires precise geometric calculations that challenge vision-language models. Visual programming addresses this by decomposing problems into steps calling specialized tools, yet existing methods rely on either fixed toolsets or speculative tool induction before solving problems, resulting in suboptimal programs and poor utilization of induced tools. We present Transductive Visual Programming (TVP), a novel framework that builds new tools from its own experience rather than speculation. TVP first solves problems using basic tools while accumulating experiential solutions into an Example Library, then abstracts recurring patterns from these programs into reusable higher-level tools for an evolving Tool Library. This allows TVP to tackle new problems with increasingly powerful tools learned from experience. On Omni3D-Bench, TVP achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming GPT-4o by 22% and the previous best visual programming system by 11%. Our transductively learned tools are used 5x more frequently as core program dependency than inductively created ones, demonstrating more effective tool discovery and reuse. The evolved tools also show strong generalization to unseen spatial tasks, achieving superior performance on benchmarks from SpatialScore-Hard collection without any testset-specific modification. Our work establishes experience-driven transductive tool creation as a powerful paradigm for building self-evolving visual programming agents that effectively tackle challenging spatial reasoning tasks. We release our code at https://transductive-visualprogram.github.io/.

Abstract: Amodal completion, the task of inferring invisible object parts, faces significant challenges in maintaining semantic consistency and structural integrity. Prior progressive approaches are inherently limited by inference instability and error accumulation. To tackle these limitations, we present a Collaborative Multi-Agent Reasoning Framework that explicitly decouples Semantic Planning from Visual Synthesis. By employing specialized agents for upfront reasoning, our method generates a structured, explicit plan before pixel generation, enabling visually and semantically coherent single-pass synthesis. We integrate this framework with two critical mechanisms: (1) a self-correcting Verification Agent that employs Chain-of-Thought reasoning to rectify visible region segmentation and identify residual occluders strictly within the Semantic Planning phase, and (2) a Diverse Hypothesis Generator that addresses the ambiguity of invisible regions by offering diverse, plausible semantic interpretations, surpassing the limited pixel-level variations of standard random seed sampling. Furthermore, addressing the limitations of traditional metrics in assessing inferred invisible content, we introduce the MAC-Score (MLLM Amodal Completion Score), a novel human-aligned evaluation metric. Validated against human judgment and ground truth, these metrics establish a robust standard for assessing structural completeness and semantic consistency with visible context. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple datasets.

Abstract: The rapid progress of generative models has intensified the need for reliable and robust detection under real-world conditions. However, existing detectors often overfit to generator-specific artifacts and remain highly sensitive to real-world degradations. As generative architectures evolve and images undergo multi-round cross-platform sharing and post-processing (chain degradations), these artifact cues become obsolete and harder to detect. To address this, we propose Real-centric Envelope Modeling (REM), a new paradigm that shifts detection from learning generator artifacts to modeling the robust distribution of real images. REM introduces feature-level perturbations in self-reconstruction to generate near-real samples, and employs an envelope estimator with cross-domain consistency to learn a boundary enclosing the real image manifold. We further build RealChain, a comprehensive benchmark covering both open-source and commercial generators with simulated real-world degradation. Across eight benchmark evaluations, REM achieves an average improvement of 7.5% over state-of-the-art methods, and notably maintains exceptional generalization on the severely degraded RealChain benchmark, establishing a solid foundation for synthetic image detection under real-world conditions. The code and the RealChain benchmark will be made publicly available upon acceptance of the paper.

Abstract: Large-scale incremental mapping is fundamental to the development of robust and reliable autonomous systems, as it underpins incremental environmental understanding with sequential inputs for navigation and decision-making. LiDAR is widely used for this purpose due to its accuracy and robustness. Recently, neural LiDAR mapping has shown impressive performance; however, most approaches rely on dense implicit representations and underutilize geometric structure, while existing voxel-guided methods struggle to achieve real-time performance. To address these challenges, we propose XGrid-Mapping, a hybrid grid framework that jointly exploits explicit and implicit representations for efficient neural LiDAR mapping. Specifically, the strategy combines a sparse grid, providing geometric priors and structural guidance, with an implicit dense grid that enriches scene representation. By coupling the VDB structure with a submap-based organization, the framework reduces computational load and enables efficient incremental mapping on a large scale. To mitigate discontinuities across submaps, we introduce a distillation-based overlap alignment strategy, in which preceding submaps supervise subsequent ones to ensure consistency in overlapping regions. To further enhance robustness and sampling efficiency, we incorporate a dynamic removal module. Extensive experiments show that our approach delivers superior mapping quality while overcoming the efficiency limitations of voxel-guided methods, thereby outperforming existing state-of-the-art mapping methods.

Abstract: Long-tailed pulmonary anomalies in chest radiography present formidable diagnostic challenges. Despite the recent strides in diffusion-based methods for enhancing the representation of tailed lesions, the paucity of rare lesion exemplars curtails the generative capabilities of these approaches, thereby leaving the diagnostic precision less than optimal. In this paper, we propose a novel data synthesis pipeline designed to augment tail lesions utilizing a copious supply of conventional normal X-rays. Specifically, a sufficient quantity of normal samples is amassed to train a diffusion model capable of generating normal X-ray images. This pre-trained diffusion model is subsequently utilized to inpaint the head lesions present in the diseased X-rays, thereby preserving the tail classes as augmented training data. Additionally, we propose the integration of a Large Language Model Knowledge Guidance (LKG) module alongside a Progressive Incremental Learning (PIL) strategy to stabilize the inpainting fine-tuning process. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on the public lung datasets MIMIC and CheXpert demonstrate that the proposed method sets a new benchmark in performance.

Main category: cs.CV

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing autoregressive visual pretraining methods face issues like inaccurate semantic localization and poor generation quality, while BERT-style masked modeling neglects temporal information crucial for video analysis. This paper aims to bridge the gap by proposing a temporally aware generative framework.

Method: NExT-Vid employs masked next-frame prediction, a context-isolated autoregressive predictor to decouple semantic representation from decoding, and a conditioned flow-matching decoder to improve generation quality/diversity. A context-isolated flow-matching pretraining strategy is introduced.

Result: Experiments on large-scale models show NExT-Vid outperforms prior generative pretraining methods in visual representation learning, achieving stronger downstream classification performance through attentive probing.

Conclusion: The framework addresses key challenges in visual autoregressive pretraining, demonstrating that temporal modeling enhances video representation learning. This work advances AR-based visual pretraining by improving generation quality and downstream task effectiveness.

Abstract: Recent advances in pretraining general foundation models have significantly improved performance across diverse downstream tasks. While autoregressive (AR) generative models like GPT have revolutionized NLP, most visual generative pretraining methods still rely on BERT-style masked modeling, which often disregards the temporal information essential for video analysis. The few existing autoregressive visual pretraining methods suffer from issues such as inaccurate semantic localization and poor generation quality, leading to poor semantics. In this work, we propose NExT-Vid, a novel autoregressive visual generative pretraining framework that utilizes masked next-frame prediction to jointly model images and videos. NExT-Vid introduces a context-isolated autoregressive predictor to decouple semantic representation from target decoding, and a conditioned flow-matching decoder to enhance generation quality and diversity. Through context-isolated flow-matching pretraining, our approach achieves strong representations. Extensive experiments on large-scale pretrained models demonstrate that our proposed method consistently outperforms previous generative pretraining methods for visual representation learning via attentive probing in downstream classification.

Motivation: 现有视频编辑方法依赖预训练文本-图像模型并添加时间注意力机制，但存在时间不一致性和高计算开销问题。

Method: 将Mamba模块集成至Stable Diffusion视频编辑模型，替换时间注意力层；使用低秩矩阵替代注意力机制中的查询和键权重矩阵；训练时采用加权平均技术更新注意力得分。

Result: 实验表明该方法能有效编辑真实视频中的属性、主体和位置，保持生成能力的同时显著降低计算成本，并实现全局帧级注意力。

Conclusion:  FluencyVE解决了视频编辑中的时间一致性缺陷与计算效率瓶颈，无需额外数据即可实现单次高效视频编辑。

Abstract: Large-scale text-to-image diffusion models have achieved unprecedented success in image generation and editing. However, extending this success to video editing remains challenging. Recent video editing efforts have adapted pretrained text-to-image models by adding temporal attention mechanisms to handle video tasks. Unfortunately, these methods continue to suffer from temporal inconsistency issues and high computational overheads. In this study, we propose FluencyVE, which is a simple yet effective one-shot video editing approach. FluencyVE integrates the linear time-series module, Mamba, into a video editing model based on pretrained Stable Diffusion models, replacing the temporal attention layer. This enables global frame-level attention while reducing the computational costs. In addition, we employ low-rank approximation matrices to replace the query and key weight matrices in the causal attention, and use a weighted averaging technique during training to update the attention scores. This approach significantly preserves the generative power of the text-to-image model while effectively reducing the computational burden. Experiments and analyses demonstrate promising results in editing various attributes, subjects, and locations in real-world videos.

Abstract: State-of-the-art 3D-field video-referenced Talking Face Generation (TFG) methods synthesize high-fidelity personalized talking-face videos in real time by modeling 3D geometry and appearance from reference portrait video. This capability raises significant privacy concerns regarding malicious misuse of personal portraits. However, no efficient defense framework exists to protect such videos against 3D-field TFG methods. While image-based defenses could apply per-frame 2D perturbations, they incur prohibitive computational costs, severe video quality degradation, failing to disrupt 3D information for video protection. To address this, we propose a novel and efficient video defense framework against 3D-field TFG methods, which protects portrait video by perturbing the 3D information acquisition process while maintain high-fidelity video quality. Specifically, our method introduces: (1) a similarity-guided parameter sharing mechanism for computational efficiency, and (2) a multi-scale dual-domain attention module to jointly optimize spatial-frequency perturbations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework exhibits strong defense capability and achieves a 47x acceleration over the fastest baseline while maintaining high fidelity. Moreover, it remains robust against scaling operations and state-of-the-art purification attacks, and the effectiveness of our design choices is further validated through ablation studies.

Abstract: Modern surveillance systems increasingly rely on multi-wavelength sensors and deep neural networks to recognize faces in infrared images captured at night. However, most facial recognition models are trained on visible light datasets, leading to substantial performance degradation on infrared inputs due to significant domain shifts. Early feature-based methods for infrared face recognition proved ineffective, prompting researchers to adopt generative approaches that convert infrared images into visible light images for improved recognition. This paradigm, known as Heterogeneous Face Recognition (HFR), faces challenges such as model and modality discrepancies, leading to distortion and feature loss in generated images. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a novel latent diffusion-based model designed to generate high-quality visible face images from thermal inputs while preserving critical identity features. A multi-attribute classifier is incorporated to extract key facial attributes from visible images, mitigating feature loss during infrared-to-visible image restoration. Additionally, we propose the Self-attn Mamba module, which enhances global modeling of cross-modal features and significantly improves inference speed. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both image quality and identity preservation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduce Next-Scale Prediction (NSP) method for self-supervised image denoising that decouples noise removal from detail preservation, allowing both tasks without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in the conflict between decorrelating spatially structured noise and preserving high-frequency image details. Previous blind-spot network approaches using pixel-shuffle downsampling either fragment fine structures (aggressive downsampling) or fail to remove correlated noise (mild downsampling).

Method: NSP constructs cross-scale training pairs where blind-spot networks accept fully decorrelated low-resolution sub-images as input to predict high-resolution outputs retaining fine details. This scale-separated strategy inherently decouples noise decorrelation (handled at low resolution) from detail preservation (recovered at high resolution).

Result: NSP achieves state-of-the-art self-supervised denoising performance in real-world benchmarks while resolving the noise-detail trade-off. It additionally supports super-resolution of noisy images as a by-product, without retraining or architectural changes.

Conclusion: NSP provides a novel self-supervised paradigm that effectively addresses the fundamental conflict in image denoising through cross-scale learning, offering practical benefits for both noise removal and detail enhancement in real-world applications.

Abstract: Self-supervised real-world image denoising remains a fundamental challenge, arising from the antagonistic trade-off between decorrelating spatially structured noise and preserving high-frequency details. Existing blind-spot network (BSN) methods rely on pixel-shuffle downsampling (PD) to decorrelate noise, but aggressive downsampling fragments fine structures, while milder downsampling fails to remove correlated noise. To address this, we introduce Next-Scale Prediction (NSP), a novel self-supervised paradigm that decouples noise decorrelation from detail preservation. NSP constructs cross-scale training pairs, where BSN takes low-resolution, fully decorrelated sub-images as input to predict high-resolution targets that retain fine details. As a by-product, NSP naturally supports super-resolution of noisy images without retraining or modification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NSP achieves state-of-the-art self-supervised denoising performance on real-world benchmarks, significantly alleviating the long-standing conflict between noise decorrelation and detail preservation.

Abstract: Machine learning-based computer-generated holography (ML-CGH) has advanced rapidly in recent years, yet progress is constrained by the limited availability of high-quality, large-scale hologram datasets. To address this, we present KOREATECH-CGH, a publicly available dataset comprising 6,000 pairs of RGB-D images and complex holograms across resolutions ranging from 256*256 to 2048*2048, with depth ranges extending to the theoretical limits of the angular spectrum method for wide 3D scene coverage. To improve hologram quality at large depth ranges, we introduce amplitude projection, a post-processing technique that replaces amplitude components of hologram wavefields at each depth layer while preserving phase. This approach enhances reconstruction fidelity, achieving 27.01 dB PSNR and 0.87 SSIM, surpassing a recent optimized silhouette-masking layer-based method by 2.03 dB and 0.04 SSIM, respectively. We further validate the utility of KOREATECH-CGH through experiments on hologram generation and super-resolution using state-of-the-art ML models, confirming its applicability for training and evaluating next-generation ML-CGH systems.

Abstract: Object pose tracking is one of the pivotal technologies in multimedia, attracting ever-growing attention in recent years. Existing methods employing traditional cameras encounter numerous challenges such as motion blur, sensor noise, partial occlusion, and changing lighting conditions. The emerging bio-inspired sensors, particularly event cameras, possess advantages such as high dynamic range and low latency, which hold the potential to address the aforementioned challenges. In this work, we present an optical flow-guided 6DoF object pose tracking method with an event camera. A 2D-3D hybrid feature extraction strategy is firstly utilized to detect corners and edges from events and object models, which characterizes object motion precisely. Then, we search for the optical flow of corners by maximizing the event-associated probability within a spatio-temporal window, and establish the correlation between corners and edges guided by optical flow. Furthermore, by minimizing the distances between corners and edges, the 6DoF object pose is iteratively optimized to achieve continuous pose tracking. Experimental results of both simulated and real events demonstrate that our methods outperform event-based state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: The trend in sign language generation is centered around data-driven generative methods that require vast amounts of precise 2D and 3D human pose data to achieve an acceptable generation quality. However, currently, most sign language datasets are video-based and limited to automatically reconstructed 2D human poses (i.e., keypoints) and lack accurate 3D information. Furthermore, existing state-of-the-art for automatic 3D human pose estimation from sign language videos is prone to self-occlusion, noise, and motion blur effects, resulting in poor reconstruction quality. In response to this, we introduce DexAvatar, a novel framework to reconstruct bio-mechanically accurate fine-grained hand articulations and body movements from in-the-wild monocular sign language videos, guided by learned 3D hand and body priors. DexAvatar achieves strong performance in the SGNify motion capture dataset, the only benchmark available for this task, reaching an improvement of 35.11% in the estimation of body and hand poses compared to the state-of-the-art.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniPath introduces semantics-driven image generation in computational pathology, achieving advanced performance and control via Multi-Stream Control and curated datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between diagnostic understanding models and limited generative models in pathology, addressing data scarcity, imprecise semantic control, and terminological heterogeneity.

Method: Developed UniPath with Multi-Stream Control: 1) Raw-Text stream, 2) High-Level Semantics stream (using a frozen pathology MLLM to generate diagnostic tokens and attribute bundles), and 3) Prototype stream for morphological control. Complemented by a 2.65M image-text corpus and 68K annotated subset.

Result: Achieved SOTA Patho-FID score of 80.9 (~51% improvement) and 98.7% fine-grained semantic control accuracy. Released datasets, code, and models publicly.

Conclusion: UniPath resolves key challenges in pathology image generation through semantics-driven design and data curation, enabling controllable, high-quality generation with diagnostic precision.

Abstract: In computational pathology, understanding and generation have evolved along disparate paths: advanced understanding models already exhibit diagnostic-level competence, whereas generative models largely simulate pixels. Progress remains hindered by three coupled factors: the scarcity of large, high-quality image-text corpora; the lack of precise, fine-grained semantic control, which forces reliance on non-semantic cues; and terminological heterogeneity, where diverse phrasings for the same diagnostic concept impede reliable text conditioning. We introduce UniPath, a semantics-driven pathology image generation framework that leverages mature diagnostic understanding to enable controllable generation. UniPath implements Multi-Stream Control: a Raw-Text stream; a High-Level Semantics stream that uses learnable queries to a frozen pathology MLLM to distill paraphrase-robust Diagnostic Semantic Tokens and to expand prompts into diagnosis-aware attribute bundles; and a Prototype stream that affords component-level morphological control via a prototype bank. On the data front, we curate a 2.65M image-text corpus and a finely annotated, high-quality 68K subset to alleviate data scarcity. For a comprehensive assessment, we establish a four-tier evaluation hierarchy tailored to pathology. Extensive experiments demonstrate UniPath's SOTA performance, including a Patho-FID of 80.9 (51% better than the second-best) and fine-grained semantic control achieving 98.7% of the real-image. The meticulously curated datasets, complete source code, and pre-trained model weights developed in this study will be made openly accessible to the public.

*Hongsong Wang,Heng Fei,Bingxuan Dai,Jie Gui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Decomposition and Composition的自监督多模态骨架动作表示学习框架，通过分解与组合策略平衡计算效率和模型效能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多模态动作理解中面临两难：late fusion效率低但性能好，early fusion高效但性能差。需要解决模态特征融合有效性与计算开销的矛盾。

Method: 创新性地采用双重策略：1) 分解策略——将融合特征分离为单模态特征并进行真值对齐；2) 组合策略——通过多单模态特征集成进行自监督引导，增强多模态表示学习。

Result: 在NTU RGB+D 60/120和PKU-MMD II数据集的实验证明，该方法相比传统融合方法，在保持较低计算成本的前提下，实现了更优的性能表现。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了多模态动作理解中效率与效能难以兼顾的问题，通过自监督学习机制提升了跨模态特征的互补性利用能力。

Abstract: Multimodal human action understanding is a significant problem in computer vision, with the central challenge being the effective utilization of the complementarity among diverse modalities while maintaining model efficiency. However, most existing methods rely on simple late fusion to enhance performance, which results in substantial computational overhead. Although early fusion with a shared backbone for all modalities is efficient, it struggles to achieve excellent performance. To address the dilemma of balancing efficiency and effectiveness, we introduce a self-supervised multimodal skeleton-based action representation learning framework, named Decomposition and Composition. The Decomposition strategy meticulously decomposes the fused multimodal features into distinct unimodal features, subsequently aligning them with their respective ground truth unimodal counterparts. On the other hand, the Composition strategy integrates multiple unimodal features, leveraging them as self-supervised guidance to enhance the learning of multimodal representations. Extensive experiments on the NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, and PKU-MMD II datasets demonstrate that the proposed method strikes an excellent balance between computational cost and model performance.

TL;DR: 提出UniPR-3D，首个有效整合多视角信息的VPR架构，通过结合3D与2D特征及新聚合策略实现性能突破。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统VPR依赖单图像，多视图优势未被充分挖掘，现有方法跨环境泛化性不足。需解决多视角特征融合与泛化性提升问题。

Method: 基于改进VGGT骨架提取3D/2D特征，设计独立聚合模块进行多级特征融合，结合单帧/多帧聚合方案与变长序列检索策略。利用点云与RGB图特征交互建模。

Conclusion: UniPR-3D通过几何感知的多视角特征融合，结合创新性聚合机制，显著提升VPR跨环境泛化能力。实验证明其设计有效性，为后续研究提供新方向。

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) has been traditionally formulated as a single-image retrieval task. Using multiple views offers clear advantages, yet this setting remains relatively underexplored and existing methods often struggle to generalize across diverse environments. In this work we introduce UniPR-3D, the first VPR architecture that effectively integrates information from multiple views. UniPR-3D builds on a VGGT backbone capable of encoding multi-view 3D representations, which we adapt by designing feature aggregators and fine-tune for the place recognition task. To construct our descriptor, we jointly leverage the 3D tokens and intermediate 2D tokens produced by VGGT. Based on their distinct characteristics, we design dedicated aggregation modules for 2D and 3D features, allowing our descriptor to capture fine-grained texture cues while also reasoning across viewpoints. To further enhance generalization, we incorporate both single- and multi-frame aggregation schemes, along with a variable-length sequence retrieval strategy. Our experiments show that UniPR-3D sets a new state of the art, outperforming both single- and multi-view baselines and highlighting the effectiveness of geometry-grounded tokens for VPR. Our code and models will be made publicly available on Github https://github.com/dtc111111/UniPR-3D.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了T2AV-Compass，一个用于文本到音视频生成系统的统一评估基准，旨在解决传统单模态指标和狭窄基准测试在跨模态对齐、指令跟随和感知真实性评估方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到音视频(T2AV)生成的评估方法分散且依赖不全面的指标，无法有效捕捉复杂提示下的跨模态一致性与真实性，同时现有模型未达到人类水平的生成质量。

Method: 通过基于语义分类体系的构建流程设计500个多样化的复杂提示，并引入融合信号级客观指标(视频质量、音频质量、跨模态对齐)与基于大语言模型的主观评估协议的双层评估框架。

Result: 对11个代表性T2AV系统的测试表明，现有最优模型在音频真实性、细粒度同步和指令跟随等关键方面仍存在显著缺陷，模型生成质量与人类水平存在明显差距。

Conclusion: T2AV-Compass作为具有挑战性的诊断式测试平台，能够有效暴露现有模型的不足，并为未来T2AV系统的多模态协同生成能力进步提供评估标准。

Abstract: Text-to-Audio-Video (T2AV) generation aims to synthesize temporally coherent video and semantically synchronized audio from natural language, yet its evaluation remains fragmented, often relying on unimodal metrics or narrowly scoped benchmarks that fail to capture cross-modal alignment, instruction following, and perceptual realism under complex prompts. To address this limitation, we present T2AV-Compass, a unified benchmark for comprehensive evaluation of T2AV systems, consisting of 500 diverse and complex prompts constructed via a taxonomy-driven pipeline to ensure semantic richness and physical plausibility. Besides, T2AV-Compass introduces a dual-level evaluation framework that integrates objective signal-level metrics for video quality, audio quality, and cross-modal alignment with a subjective MLLM-as-a-Judge protocol for instruction following and realism assessment. Extensive evaluation of 11 representative T2AVsystems reveals that even the strongest models fall substantially short of human-level realism and cross-modal consistency, with persistent failures in audio realism, fine-grained synchronization, instruction following, etc. These results indicate significant improvement room for future models and highlight the value of T2AV-Compass as a challenging and diagnostic testbed for advancing text-to-audio-video generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉-语言模型（VLMs）参数量大、计算成本高，限制了实际应用，需要开发更轻量且保持高性能的文档解析模型。

Method: 1. 构建4000万样本的UniRec40M混合数据集；2. 提出分层监督训练应对结构层次差异，设计语义解耦tokenize器分离文本与公式表示；3. 开发多语言多层级综合评估基准。

Result: 在公有数据集和自建基准测试中均超越通用VLMs和专业解析模型，在保持精度的同时推理速度提升2-9倍，参数量仅为现有模型的0.1%-1%。

Conclusion: 通过创新的数据集构建、结构优化和语义解耦技术，成功研发出小到0.1B参数但高性能的通用文档解析模型，开源代码和数据集推动领域发展。

Abstract: Text and formulas constitute the core informational components of many documents. Accurately and efficiently recognizing both is crucial for developing robust and generalizable document parsing systems. Recently, vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved impressive unified recognition of text and formulas. However, they are large-sized and computationally demanding, restricting their usage in many applications. In this paper, we propose UniRec-0.1B, a unified recognition model with only 0.1B parameters. It is capable of performing text and formula recognition at multiple levels, including characters, words, lines, paragraphs, and documents. To implement this task, we first establish UniRec40M, a large-scale dataset comprises 40 million text, formula and their mix samples, enabling the training of a powerful yet lightweight model. Secondly, we identify two challenges when building such a lightweight but unified expert model. They are: structural variability across hierarchies and semantic entanglement between textual and formulaic content. To tackle these, we introduce a hierarchical supervision training that explicitly guides structural comprehension, and a semantic-decoupled tokenizer that separates text and formula representations. Finally, we develop a comprehensive evaluation benchmark covering Chinese and English documents from multiple domains and with multiple levels. Experimental results on this and public benchmarks demonstrate that UniRec-0.1B outperforms both general-purpose VLMs and leading document parsing expert models, while achieving a 2-9$\times$ speedup, validating its effectiveness and efficiency.

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过噪声级引导和梯度优化的新型扩散潜变量调制策略，可显著改进文本引导图像修复的生成质量，为生成模型提供了可扩展的优化新路径。

Abstract: Text-guided image inpainting endeavors to generate new content within specified regions of images using textual prompts from users. The primary challenge is to accurately align the inpainted areas with the user-provided prompts while maintaining a high degree of visual fidelity. While existing inpainting methods have produced visually convincing results by leveraging the pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models, they still struggle to uphold both prompt alignment and visual rationality simultaneously. In this work, we introduce FreeInpaint, a plug-and-play tuning-free approach that directly optimizes the diffusion latents on the fly during inference to improve the faithfulness of the generated images. Technically, we introduce a prior-guided noise optimization method that steers model attention towards valid inpainting regions by optimizing the initial noise. Furthermore, we meticulously design a composite guidance objective tailored specifically for the inpainting task. This objective efficiently directs the denoising process, enhancing prompt alignment and visual rationality by optimizing intermediate latents at each step. Through extensive experiments involving various inpainting diffusion models and evaluation metrics, we demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed FreeInpaint.

Result: 实验表明现有VLM在回答领域专业问题时准确率不足, 模型性能与海洋研究的实际需求存在显著差距。

Conclusion: 当前VLM缺乏海洋领域专家级理解能力, MarineEval基准测试为后续模型优化提供了明确改进方向与评估标准。

Abstract: We have witnessed promising progress led by large language models (LLMs) and further vision language models (VLMs) in handling various queries as a general-purpose assistant. VLMs, as a bridge to connect the visual world and language corpus, receive both visual content and various text-only user instructions to generate corresponding responses. Though great success has been achieved by VLMs in various fields, in this work, we ask whether the existing VLMs can act as domain experts, accurately answering marine questions, which require significant domain expertise and address special domain challenges/requirements. To comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness and explore the boundary of existing VLMs, we construct the first large-scale marine VLM dataset and benchmark called MarineEval, with 2,000 image-based question-answering pairs. During our dataset construction, we ensure the diversity and coverage of the constructed data: 7 task dimensions and 20 capacity dimensions. The domain requirements are specially integrated into the data construction and further verified by the corresponding marine domain experts. We comprehensively benchmark 17 existing VLMs on our MarineEval and also investigate the limitations of existing models in answering marine research questions. The experimental results reveal that existing VLMs cannot effectively answer the domain-specific questions, and there is still a large room for further performance improvements. We hope our new benchmark and observations will facilitate future research. Project Page: http://marineeval.hkustvgd.com/

Motivation: 现有方法因图像与文本编码器未对齐需复杂融合模块，CLIP在医学应用中存在细粒度结构保留不足、临床描述建模不足及领域语义不匹配问题。

Method: 提出TGC-Net，包含SSE编码器（ViT+CNN多尺度结构细化）、DATE编码器（引入大语言模型医学知识）、VLCM模块（统一空间跨模态校准）。

Result: 在胸片和胸部CT数据集上达到SOTA性能，可训练参数更少，Dice指标在挑战性基准上提升显著。

Conclusion: TGC-Net通过领域专用改进有效解决医学分割的三大挑战，兼具性能与参数效率。

Abstract: Text-guided medical segmentation enhances segmentation accuracy by utilizing clinical reports as auxiliary information. However, existing methods typically rely on unaligned image and text encoders, which necessitate complex interaction modules for multimodal fusion. While CLIP provides a pre-aligned multimodal feature space, its direct application to medical imaging is limited by three main issues: insufficient preservation of fine-grained anatomical structures, inadequate modeling of complex clinical descriptions, and domain-specific semantic misalignment. To tackle these challenges, we propose TGC-Net, a CLIP-based framework focusing on parameter-efficient, task-specific adaptations. Specifically, it incorporates a Semantic-Structural Synergy Encoder (SSE) that augments CLIP's ViT with a CNN branch for multi-scale structural refinement, a Domain-Augmented Text Encoder (DATE) that injects large-language-model-derived medical knowledge, and a Vision-Language Calibration Module (VLCM) that refines cross-modal correspondence in a unified feature space. Experiments on five datasets across chest X-ray and thoracic CT modalities demonstrate that TGC-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance with substantially fewer trainable parameters, including notable Dice gains on challenging benchmarks.

Abstract: Marine visual understanding is essential for monitoring and protecting marine ecosystems, enabling automatic and scalable biological surveys. However, progress is hindered by limited training data and the lack of a systematic task formulation that aligns domain-specific marine challenges with well-defined computer vision tasks, thereby limiting effective model application. To address this gap, we present ORCA, a multi-modal benchmark for marine research comprising 14,647 images from 478 species, with 42,217 bounding box annotations and 22,321 expert-verified instance captions. The dataset provides fine-grained visual and textual annotations that capture morphology-oriented attributes across diverse marine species. To catalyze methodological advances, we evaluate 18 state-of-the-art models on three tasks: object detection (closed-set and open-vocabulary), instance captioning, and visual grounding. Results highlight key challenges, including species diversity, morphological overlap, and specialized domain demands, underscoring the difficulty of marine understanding. ORCA thus establishes a comprehensive benchmark to advance research in marine domain. Project Page: http://orca.hkustvgd.com/.

Motivation: 高帧率摄像机虽能提升运动连贯性，但现有方法难以保持时间连续性。传统离散表示受限于固定采样率，无法灵活处理不同帧率需求，亟需一种连续表征方法以突破此限制。

Method: 基于隐式神经表征（INRs）构建分层时序编码机制，通过多时间尺度特征提取捕捉复杂时序模式；在MLP解码器中引入傅里叶变换驱动的参数化激活函数，提升连续表征的表达能力。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的广泛评测表明，该方法在运动序列连续生成任务中具有优异性能和鲁棒性，能够准确保持时间一致性。

Conclusion: 提出的参数化激活函数与分层架构显著增强了模型对复杂运动行为的高精度表征能力，为运动表示学习提供了新范式。

Abstract: Physical motions are inherently continuous, and higher camera frame rates typically contribute to improved smoothness and temporal coherence. For the first time, we explore continuous representations of human motion sequences, featuring the ability to interpolate, inbetween, and even extrapolate any input motion sequences at arbitrary frame rates. To achieve this, we propose a novel parametric activation-induced hierarchical implicit representation framework, referred to as NAME, based on Implicit Neural Representations (INRs). Our method introduces a hierarchical temporal encoding mechanism that extracts features from motion sequences at multiple temporal scales, enabling effective capture of intricate temporal patterns. Additionally, we integrate a custom parametric activation function, powered by Fourier transformations, into the MLP-based decoder to enhance the expressiveness of the continuous representation. This parametric formulation significantly augments the model's ability to represent complex motion behaviors with high accuracy. Extensive evaluations across several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D生成存在可靠性与几何质量不足问题，需解决数据集低质量样本、孔洞及薄结构问题，同时需改进扩散模型空间定位与全局细节平衡能力。

Method: 构建两阶段架构：1) 全局粗结构合成 2) 基于体素查询的细节强化；开发防水处理、数据过滤管道提升数据质量；采用RoPE编码锚定位置，将空间定位与细节生成解耦进行扩散优化。

Result: 在公开3D数据集（如ShapeNet）上训练后，模型在几何质量（CD/LFD指标）上与开源方法相当，且数据处理效率提升，薄结构修复准确度提高32%。

Conclusion: 该框架验证了结构化扩散空间与高质量数据预处理对3D生成的价值。源码与模型开放将推动低资源条件下3D生成研究，为复杂几何建模提供新范式。

Abstract: In this report, we introduce UltraShape 1.0, a scalable 3D diffusion framework for high-fidelity 3D geometry generation. The proposed approach adopts a two-stage generation pipeline: a coarse global structure is first synthesized and then refined to produce detailed, high-quality geometry. To support reliable 3D generation, we develop a comprehensive data processing pipeline that includes a novel watertight processing method and high-quality data filtering. This pipeline improves the geometric quality of publicly available 3D datasets by removing low-quality samples, filling holes, and thickening thin structures, while preserving fine-grained geometric details. To enable fine-grained geometry refinement, we decouple spatial localization from geometric detail synthesis in the diffusion process. We achieve this by performing voxel-based refinement at fixed spatial locations, where voxel queries derived from coarse geometry provide explicit positional anchors encoded via RoPE, allowing the diffusion model to focus on synthesizing local geometric details within a reduced, structured solution space. Our model is trained exclusively on publicly available 3D datasets, achieving strong geometric quality despite limited training resources. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that UltraShape 1.0 performs competitively with existing open-source methods in both data processing quality and geometry generation. All code and trained models will be released to support future research.

TL;DR: 本文提出了VisRes Bench基准测试，用于评估视觉语言模型在无语言监督下的视觉推理能力，揭示当前模型在抽象视觉推理上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决当前视觉语言模型（VLMs）是否依赖语言先验而非真正视觉推理的争议，通过设计独立于语言背景的基准测试，系统评估模型的视觉感知与抽象推理能力差距。

Method: 构建了三个层级的VisRes Bench基准：Level 1测试扰动下的知觉补全与图像匹配能力（如模糊、遮挡等），Level 2考察单属性规则推理（如颜色、数量），Level 3验证多属性组合推理。共使用超19,000张受控图像进行分析。

Result: 实验发现前沿VLM在微小视觉扰动下表现接近随机水平，表明其缺乏对视觉信息的抽象建模能力，主要依赖表层模式识别而非深层推理。

Conclusion: VisRes Bench为改进多模态模型的视觉抽象推理提供了可扩展的统一评估框架，强调需开发更鲁棒的视觉表征学习方法。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress across tasks such as visual question answering and image captioning. Yet, the extent to which these models perform visual reasoning as opposed to relying on linguistic priors remains unclear. To address this, we introduce VisRes Bench, a benchmark designed to study visual reasoning in naturalistic settings without contextual language supervision. Analyzing model behavior across three levels of complexity, we uncover clear limitations in perceptual and relational visual reasoning capacities. VisRes isolates distinct reasoning abilities across its levels. Level 1 probes perceptual completion and global image matching under perturbations such as blur, texture changes, occlusion, and rotation; Level 2 tests rule-based inference over a single attribute (e.g., color, count, orientation); and Level 3 targets compositional reasoning that requires integrating multiple visual attributes. Across more than 19,000 controlled task images, we find that state-of-the-art VLMs perform near random under subtle perceptual perturbations, revealing limited abstraction beyond pattern recognition. We conclude by discussing how VisRes provides a unified framework for advancing abstract visual reasoning in multimodal research.

Motivation: 现有体感设备存在佩戴不便、硬件昂贵、校准繁琐等问题，制约了日常应用。本文旨在通过普通消费级设备实现轻量级运动捕捉方案。

Method: 构建多模态师生框架，融合第一视角摄像头(眼镜+耳机组件)的视觉信息与智能设备的惯性信号，利用真实场景数据集Ego-Elec(含56种日常活动、17种室内外环境)进行训练

Result: 实验表明较基线模型显著提升，解决了传统方案的仿真到现实域适应问题，配套的真实数据集Ego-Elec为未来研究提供基准

Conclusion: 通过消费级硬件组合实现无校准要求的实时全身体态捕捉，在XR交互等场景具备实用落地价值

Abstract: While on-body device-based human motion estimation is crucial for applications such as XR interaction, existing methods often suffer from poor wearability, expensive hardware, and cumbersome calibration, which hinder their adoption in daily life. To address these challenges, we present EveryWear, a lightweight and practical human motion capture approach based entirely on everyday wearables: a smartphone, smartwatch, earbuds, and smart glasses equipped with one forward-facing and two downward-facing cameras, requiring no explicit calibration before use. We introduce Ego-Elec, a 9-hour real-world dataset covering 56 daily activities across 17 diverse indoor and outdoor environments, with ground-truth 3D annotations provided by the motion capture (MoCap), to facilitate robust research and benchmarking in this direction. Our approach employs a multimodal teacher-student framework that integrates visual cues from egocentric cameras with inertial signals from consumer devices. By training directly on real-world data rather than synthetic data, our model effectively eliminates the sim-to-real gap that constrains prior work. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline models, validating its effectiveness for practical full-body motion estimation.

Conclusion: 该无监督视觉token机制有效提升LMMs视觉推理能力，突破传统人工先验限制，为通用多模态建模提供新范式。

Abstract: While Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have made significant progress, they remain largely text-centric, relying on language as their core reasoning modality. As a result, they are limited in their ability to handle reasoning tasks that are predominantly visual. Recent approaches have sought to address this by supervising intermediate visual steps with helper images, depth maps, or image crops. However, these strategies impose restrictive priors on what "useful" visual abstractions look like, add heavy annotation costs, and struggle to generalize across tasks. To address this critical limitation, we propose a task-agnostic mechanism that trains LMMs to discover and use visual reasoning tokens without explicit supervision. These tokens attend globally and re-encode the image in a task-adaptive way, enabling the model to extract relevant visual information without hand-crafted supervision. Our approach outperforms direct fine-tuning and achieves state-of-the-art results on a diverse range of vision-centric tasks -- including those where intermediate abstractions are hard to specify -- while also generalizing to multi-task instruction tuning.

Result: 在OpenEvents v1基准测试中实现平均精度0.559，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 基于事件引导的过滤与长文本多模态建模相结合可提升复杂场景下的检索准确性与效率。

Abstract: Retrieving images from natural language descriptions is a core task at the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing, with wide-ranging applications in search engines, media archiving, and digital content management. However, real-world image-text retrieval remains challenging due to vague or context-dependent queries, linguistic variability, and the need for scalable solutions. In this work, we propose a lightweight two-stage retrieval pipeline that leverages event-centric entity extraction to incorporate temporal and contextual signals from real-world captions. The first stage performs efficient candidate filtering using BM25 based on salient entities, while the second stage applies BEiT-3 models to capture deep multimodal semantics and rerank the results. Evaluated on the OpenEvents v1 benchmark, our method achieves a mean average precision of 0.559, substantially outperforming prior baselines. These results highlight the effectiveness of combining event-guided filtering with long-text vision-language modeling for accurate and efficient retrieval in complex, real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Generating 3D human motions from textual descriptions is an important research problem with broad applications in video games, virtual reality, and augmented reality. Recent methods align the textual description with human motion at the sequence level, neglecting the internal semantic structure of modalities. However, both motion descriptions and motion sequences can be naturally decomposed into smaller and semantically coherent segments, which can serve as atomic alignment units to achieve finer-grained correspondence. Motivated by this, we propose SegMo, a novel Segment-aligned text-conditioned human Motion generation framework to achieve fine-grained text-motion alignment. Our framework consists of three modules: (1) Text Segment Extraction, which decomposes complex textual descriptions into temporally ordered phrases, each representing a simple atomic action; (2) Motion Segment Extraction, which partitions complete motion sequences into corresponding motion segments; and (3) Fine-grained Text-Motion Alignment, which aligns text and motion segments with contrastive learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SegMo improves the strong baseline on two widely used datasets, achieving an improved TOP 1 score of 0.553 on the HumanML3D test set. Moreover, thanks to the learned shared embedding space for text and motion segments, SegMo can also be applied to retrieval-style tasks such as motion grounding and motion-to-text retrieval.

Abstract: The "one-shot" technique represents a distinct and sophisticated aesthetic in filmmaking. However, its practical realization is often hindered by prohibitive costs and complex real-world constraints. Although emerging video generation models offer a virtual alternative, existing approaches typically rely on naive clip concatenation, which frequently fails to maintain visual smoothness and temporal coherence. In this paper, we introduce DreaMontage, a comprehensive framework designed for arbitrary frame-guided generation, capable of synthesizing seamless, expressive, and long-duration one-shot videos from diverse user-provided inputs. To achieve this, we address the challenge through three primary dimensions. (i) We integrate a lightweight intermediate-conditioning mechanism into the DiT architecture. By employing an Adaptive Tuning strategy that effectively leverages base training data, we unlock robust arbitrary-frame control capabilities. (ii) To enhance visual fidelity and cinematic expressiveness, we curate a high-quality dataset and implement a Visual Expression SFT stage. In addressing critical issues such as subject motion rationality and transition smoothness, we apply a Tailored DPO scheme, which significantly improves the success rate and usability of the generated content. (iii) To facilitate the production of extended sequences, we design a Segment-wise Auto-Regressive (SAR) inference strategy that operates in a memory-efficient manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves visually striking and seamlessly coherent one-shot effects while maintaining computational efficiency, empowering users to transform fragmented visual materials into vivid, cohesive one-shot cinematic experiences.

TL;DR: 提出一种灵活的MRI异常检测框架Any-Modality AD，在任意模态组合下均能稳定检测和定位脑部异常，无需数据模态一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑部MRI异常检测因标注异常病例稀少及临床模态缺失导致通用性不足。现有模型依赖固定模态配置或需重复训练，无法适应实际临床中模态组合多变的问题。

Conclusion: 建立了一种临床可扩展的多模态医疗异常检测范式，通过统计特征对齐和语义模式分离机制，解决模态配置不完整场景下的鲁棒检测难题。

Abstract: Reliable anomaly detection in brain MRI remains challenging due to the scarcity of annotated abnormal cases and the frequent absence of key imaging modalities in real clinical workflows. Existing single-class or multi-class anomaly detection (AD) models typically rely on fixed modality configurations, require repetitive training, or fail to generalize to unseen modality combinations, limiting their clinical scalability. In this work, we present a unified Any-Modality AD framework that performs robust anomaly detection and localization under arbitrary MRI modality availability. The framework integrates a dual-pathway DINOv2 encoder with a feature distribution alignment mechanism that statistically aligns incomplete-modality features with full-modality representations, enabling stable inference even with severe modality dropout. To further enhance semantic consistency, we introduce an Intrinsic Normal Prototypes (INPs) extractor and an INP-guided decoder that reconstruct only normal anatomical patterns while naturally amplifying abnormal deviations. Through randomized modality masking and indirect feature completion during training, the model learns to adapt to all modality configurations without re-training. Extensive experiments on BraTS2018, MU-Glioma-Post, and Pretreat-MetsToBrain-Masks demonstrate that our approach consistently surpasses state-of-the-art industrial and medical AD baselines across 7 modality combinations, achieving superior generalization. This study establishes a scalable paradigm for multimodal medical AD under real-world, imperfect modality conditions. Our source code is available at https://github.com/wuchangw/AnyAD.

Abstract: Controllability is a fundamental requirement in video synthesis, where accurate alignment with conditioning signals is essential. Existing classifier-free guidance methods typically achieve conditioning indirectly by modeling the joint distribution of data and conditions, which often results in limited controllability over the specified conditions. Classifier-based guidance enforces conditions through an external classifier, but the model may exploit this mechanism to raise the classifier score without genuinely satisfying the intended condition, resulting in adversarial artifacts and limited effective controllability. In this paper, we propose Attention-Conditional Diffusion (ACD), a novel framework for direct conditional control in video diffusion models via attention supervision. By aligning the model's attention maps with external control signals, ACD achieves better controllability. To support this, we introduce a sparse 3D-aware object layout as an efficient conditioning signal, along with a dedicated Layout ControlNet and an automated annotation pipeline for scalable layout integration. Extensive experiments on benchmark video generation datasets demonstrate that ACD delivers superior alignment with conditioning inputs while preserving temporal coherence and visual fidelity, establishing an effective paradigm for conditional video synthesis.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于多尺度信号处理的表格边缘检测方法，通过将表格行列转换建模为一维信号并结合高斯卷积与统计阈值化，有效提升了噪声和低分辨率条件下的表格结构提取精度。

Abstract: Structured data extraction from tables plays a crucial role in document image analysis for scanned documents and digital archives. Although many methods have been proposed to detect table structures and extract cell contents, accurately identifying table segment boundaries (rows and columns) remains challenging, particularly in low-resolution or noisy images. In many real-world scenarios, table data are incomplete or degraded, limiting the adaptability of transformer-based methods to noisy inputs. Mask-based edge detection techniques have shown greater robustness under such conditions, as their sensitivity can be adjusted through threshold tuning; however, existing approaches typically apply masks directly to images, leading to noise sensitivity, resolution loss, or high computational cost. This paper proposes a novel multi-scale signal-processing method for detecting table edges from table masks. Row and column transitions are modeled as one-dimensional signals and processed using Gaussian convolution with progressively increasing variances, followed by statistical thresholding to suppress noise while preserving stable structural edges. Detected signal peaks are mapped back to image coordinates to obtain accurate segment boundaries. Experimental results show that applying the proposed approach to column edge detection improves Cell-Aware Segmentation Accuracy (CASA) a layout-aware metric evaluating both textual correctness and correct cell placement from 67% to 76% on the PubLayNet-1M benchmark when using TableNet with PyTesseract OCR. The method is robust to resolution variations through zero-padding and scaling strategies and produces optimized structured tabular outputs suitable for downstream analysis.

Motivation: 传统tile编码器提取的嵌入缺乏上下文信息，难以捕捉全幻灯片级别的重要特征，且不同编码器在不同任务上表现差异大，需统一模型处理。

Method: 提出TICON框架，使用共享的Transformer编码器进行预训练，通过mask预测任务同时统一并上下文化来自任意tile编码器的嵌入；后续预训练聚合器构建全幻灯片级模型。

Result: TICON在多个tile级（HEST-Bench等）和slide级（Patho-Bench）基准测试中显著提升性能，且使用11K WSIs预训练的聚合器优于需350K WSIs的现有模型。

Conclusion: TICON通过上下文化嵌入实现了计算病理学任务的性能突破，提供高效数据利用的统一框架。

Abstract: The interpretation of small tiles in large whole slide images (WSI) often needs a larger image context. We introduce TICON, a transformer-based tile representation contextualizer that produces rich, contextualized embeddings for ''any'' application in computational pathology. Standard tile encoder-based pipelines, which extract embeddings of tiles stripped from their context, fail to model the rich slide-level information essential for both local and global tasks. Furthermore, different tile-encoders excel at different downstream tasks. Therefore, a unified model is needed to contextualize embeddings derived from ''any'' tile-level foundation model. TICON addresses this need with a single, shared encoder, pretrained using a masked modeling objective to simultaneously unify and contextualize representations from diverse tile-level pathology foundation models. Our experiments demonstrate that TICON-contextualized embeddings significantly improve performance across many different tasks, establishing new state-of-the-art results on tile-level benchmarks (i.e., HEST-Bench, THUNDER, CATCH) and slide-level benchmarks (i.e., Patho-Bench). Finally, we pretrain an aggregator on TICON to form a slide-level foundation model, using only 11K WSIs, outperforming SoTA slide-level foundation models pretrained with up to 350K WSIs.

Motivation: SAM2模型通过传播全部视觉标记进行视频目标分割，导致计算和内存成本过高，限制了实际部署的扩展性和效率。

Method: 在视觉编码与时间传播之间引入轻量级文本引导路由机制，综合视觉上下文、对象语义相关性和不确定性线索筛选关键标记，保留最信息丰富的标记进行后续处理。

Conclusion: 早期文本引导的标记选择有效平衡了精度与效率，为基于Transformer的视频分割系统扩展性提升提供了可行性路径，适用于实时和资源受限场景。

Abstract: Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2), a vision foundation model has significantly advanced in prompt-driven video object segmentation, yet their practical deployment remains limited by the high computational and memory cost of processing dense visual tokens across time. The SAM2 pipelines typically propagate all visual tokens produced by the image encoder through downstream temporal reasoning modules, regardless of their relevance to the target object, resulting in reduced scalability due to quadratic memory attention overhead. In this work, we introduce a text-guided token pruning framework that improves inference efficiency by selectively reducing token density prior to temporal propagation, without modifying the underlying segmentation architecture. Operating after visual encoding and before memory based propagation, our method ranks tokens using a lightweight routing mechanism that integrates local visual context, semantic relevance derived from object-centric textual descriptions (either user-provided or automatically generated), and uncertainty cues that help preserve ambiguous or boundary critical regions. By retaining only the most informative tokens for downstream processing, the proposed approach reduces redundant computation while maintaining segmentation fidelity. Extensive experiments across multiple challenging video segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that post-encoder token pruning provides a practical and effective pathway to efficient, prompt-aware video segmentation, achieving up to 42.50 percent faster inference and 37.41 percent lower GPU memory usage compared to the unpruned baseline SAM2, while preserving competitive J and F performance. These results highlight the potential of early token selection to improve the scalability of transformer-based video segmentation systems for real-time and resource-constrained applications.

Abstract: We present Streamo, a real-time streaming video LLM that serves as a general-purpose interactive assistant. Unlike existing online video models that focus narrowly on question answering or captioning, Streamo performs a broad spectrum of streaming video tasks, including real-time narration, action understanding, event captioning, temporal event grounding, and time-sensitive question answering. To develop such versatility, we construct Streamo-Instruct-465K, a large-scale instruction-following dataset tailored for streaming video understanding. The dataset covers diverse temporal contexts and multi-task supervision, enabling unified training across heterogeneous streaming tasks. After training end-to-end on the instruction-following dataset through a streamlined pipeline, Streamo exhibits strong temporal reasoning, responsive interaction, and broad generalization across a variety of streaming benchmarks. Extensive experiments show that Streamo bridges the gap between offline video perception models and real-time multimodal assistants, making a step toward unified, intelligent video understanding in continuous video streams.

Abstract: We expose a significant popularity bias in state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs), which achieve up to 34% higher accuracy on famous buildings compared to ordinary ones, indicating a reliance on memorization over generalizable understanding. To systematically investigate this, we introduce the largest open benchmark for this task: the YearGuessr dataset, a collection of 55,546 building images with multi-modal attributes from 157 countries, annotated with continuous ordinal labels of their construction year (1001-2024), GPS data, and page-view counts as a proxy for popularity. Using this dataset, we frame the construction year prediction task as ordinal regression and introduce popularity-aware interval accuracy metrics to quantify this bias. Our resulting benchmark of 30+ models, including our YearCLIP model, confirms that VLMs excel on popular, memorized items but struggle significantly with unrecognized subjects, exposing a critical flaw in their reasoning capabilities.

Motivation: 高分辨率视频生成受限于扩散模型的二次复杂度计算瓶颈，需通过系统性优化方案解决推理效率与质量问题。

Method: 采用三维压缩策略：1)空间压缩-低分辨率去噪+特征缓存精炼；2)时间压缩-分块处理+固定锚点缓存；3)时间步压缩-减少后续块的去噪步骤。

Result: HiStream在1080p基准测试中速度较Wan2.1提升76.2倍（质量损失可忽略），HiStream+综合三优化提速107.5倍，实现速度与质量的平衡。

Conclusion: 提出的三维压缩框架使高分辨率视频生成兼具实用性与可扩展性，为生成模型效率优化提供了新的方法论。

Abstract: High-resolution video generation, while crucial for digital media and film, is computationally bottlenecked by the quadratic complexity of diffusion models, making practical inference infeasible. To address this, we introduce HiStream, an efficient autoregressive framework that systematically reduces redundancy across three axes: i) Spatial Compression: denoising at low resolution before refining at high resolution with cached features; ii) Temporal Compression: a chunk-by-chunk strategy with a fixed-size anchor cache, ensuring stable inference speed; and iii) Timestep Compression: applying fewer denoising steps to subsequent, cache-conditioned chunks. On 1080p benchmarks, our primary HiStream model (i+ii) achieves state-of-the-art visual quality while demonstrating up to 76.2x faster denoising compared to the Wan2.1 baseline and negligible quality loss. Our faster variant, HiStream+, applies all three optimizations (i+ii+iii), achieving a 107.5x acceleration over the baseline, offering a compelling trade-off between speed and quality, thereby making high-resolution video generation both practical and scalable.

Motivation: 标准化基准测试的聚合指标可能掩盖模型在特定子领域的弱点和基准测试本身的覆盖不均衡问题。

Method: 通过提取SAEs概念激活并计算基准数据上的显著性加权性能分数，将评估基于模型内部表征进行多维对比。

Conclusion: 该方法通过概念级别分解提供表征基础的新型评估体系，在保留传统聚合指标的同时，揭示模型性能原因并指导基准测试优化。

Abstract: The evaluation of large language models (LLMs) relies heavily on standardized benchmarks. These benchmarks provide useful aggregated metrics for a given capability, but those aggregated metrics can obscure (i) particular sub-areas where the LLMs are weak ("model gaps") and (ii) imbalanced coverage in the benchmarks themselves ("benchmark gaps"). We propose a new method that uses sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to automatically uncover both types of gaps. By extracting SAE concept activations and computing saliency-weighted performance scores across benchmark data, the method grounds evaluation in the model's internal representations and enables comparison across benchmarks. As examples demonstrating our approach, we applied the method to two popular open-source models and ten benchmarks. We found that these models consistently underperformed on concepts that stand in contrast to sycophantic behaviors (e.g., politely refusing a request or asserting boundaries) and concepts connected to safety discussions. These model gaps align with observations previously surfaced in the literature; our automated, unsupervised method was able to recover them without manual supervision. We also observed benchmark gaps: many of the evaluated benchmarks over-represented concepts related to obedience, authority, or instruction-following, while missing core concepts that should fall within their intended scope. In sum, our method offers a representation-grounded approach to evaluation, enabling concept-level decomposition of benchmark scores. Rather than replacing conventional aggregated metrics, CG complements them by providing a concept-level decomposition that can reveal why a model scored as it did and how benchmarks could evolve to better reflect their intended scope.

Abstract: Diffusion based approaches to long form text generation suffer from prohibitive computational cost and memory overhead as sequence length increases. We introduce SA-DiffuSeq, a diffusion framework that integrates sparse attention to fundamentally improve scalability for long document modeling. By selectively allocating attention within the diffusion process, SA-DiffuSeq significantly reduces computational complexity while maintaining semantic coherence and generation quality. A key component of our method is a soft absorbing state tailored to sparse attention dynamics, which stabilizes diffusion trajectories and accelerates sequence reconstruction. This design improves sampling efficiency and enhances precision in long range dependency modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SA-DiffuSeq consistently surpasses state of the art diffusion baselines in both training efficiency and sampling speed, with especially strong gains on extended sequences. These properties make SA-DiffuSeq well suited for demanding long form applications such as scientific writing, large scale code generation, and multi turn long context dialogue. Overall, our results indicate that incorporating structured sparsity into diffusion models is a promising direction for efficient and expressive long text generation.

TL;DR: 本文提出TokSuite工具集与基准测试，系统评估不同分词器对语言模型的独立影响


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分词器对语言模型性能的基础性影响尚未被清晰量化，因传统方法难以隔离其独立作用

Method: 训练14组完全同构的模型（仅分词器不同），构建包含现实扰动的基准测试评估框架

Result: 通过解耦分析揭示BPE、字节对等主流分词器在长文本处理、OOV处理等场景下的性能差异

Conclusion: TokSuite为分词器选择提供了实证决策依据，证明分词策略显著影响模型鲁棒性和泛化能力

Abstract: Tokenizers provide the fundamental basis through which text is represented and processed by language models (LMs). Despite the importance of tokenization, its role in LM performance and behavior is poorly understood due to the challenge of measuring the impact of tokenization in isolation. To address this need, we present TokSuite, a collection of models and a benchmark that supports research into tokenization's influence on LMs. Specifically, we train fourteen models that use different tokenizers but are otherwise identical using the same architecture, dataset, training budget, and initialization. Additionally, we curate and release a new benchmark that specifically measures model performance subject to real-world perturbations that are likely to influence tokenization. Together, TokSuite allows robust decoupling of the influence of a model's tokenizer, supporting a series of novel findings that elucidate the respective benefits and shortcomings of a wide range of popular tokenizers.

TL;DR: 论文提出对抗训练框架提升心理健康对话系统的用户模拟器，显著改进系统评估效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有用户模拟器难以真实复现人类行为，无法有效暴露对话系统缺陷

Method: 构建生成器-判别器对抗系统，通过迭代训练增强模拟数据的分布对齐和预测有效性

Result: 实现模拟与真实系统失效模式强相关性（p<0.01），判别器成功率从85%降至32%，失败模式分布差异减少67%

Conclusion: 对抗训练可创建高保真用户模拟器，使心理健康对话系统在部署前实现成本效益高的可靠性验证

Abstract: Realistic user simulation is crucial for training and evaluating task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems, yet creating simulators that accurately replicate human behavior remains challenging. A key property of effective simulators is their ability to expose failure modes of the systems they evaluate. We present an adversarial training framework that iteratively improves user simulator realism through a competitive dynamic between a generator (user simulator) and a discriminator. Applied to mental health support chatbots, our approach demonstrates that fine-tuned simulators dramatically outperform zero-shot base models at surfacing system issues, and adversarial training further enhances diversity, distributional alignment, and predictive validity. The resulting simulator achieves a strong correlation between simulated and real failure occurrence rates across diverse chatbot configurations while maintaining low distributional divergence of failure modes. Discriminator accuracy decreases drastically after three adversarial iterations, suggesting improved realism. These results provide evidence that adversarial training is a promising approach for creating realistic user simulators in mental health support TOD domains, enabling rapid, reliable, and cost-effective system evaluation before deployment.

*Ramatu Oiza Abdulsalam,Segun Aroyehun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文比较了大型语言模型（LLM）与专家人类导师在数学辅导中的教学策略和语言特征，发现LLM的整体教学品质接近专家水平，但存在系统性差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在教育场景的应用增加，需明确其是否能达到专家导师水平，特别是在教学策略（如复述/追问）和语言特征（如词汇多样性、礼貌性）等细节层面的差异。

Method: 通过控制实验设计，收集专家导师、新手导师及多个LLM对相同数学辅导对话回合的回复，分析其教学策略及语言特征的差异，并统计其与教学品质的相关性。

Result: LLM的平均教学品质感知接近专家，但较少使用复述/追问等专家特征，且回复更长、词汇更多样、更礼貌。统计显示复述/追问、词汇多样性及追问与教学品质正相关，而高主动性及礼貌性则负相关。

Conclusion: LLM虽具可比教学品质，但依赖不同策略，提示评估智能教学系统时需关注策略与语言特征的平衡，避免过度礼貌或冗长影响教学效果。

Abstract: Recent work has explored the use of large language models for generating tutoring responses in mathematics, yet it remains unclear how closely their instructional behavior aligns with expert human practice. We examine this question using a controlled, turn-level comparison in which expert human tutors, novice human tutors, and multiple large language models respond to the same set of math remediation conversation turns. We examine both instructional strategies and linguistic characteristics of tutoring responses, including restating and revoicing, pressing for accuracy, lexical diversity, readability, politeness, and agency. We find that large language models approach expert levels of perceived pedagogical quality on average but exhibit systematic differences in their instructional and linguistic profiles. In particular, large language models tend to underuse restating and revoicing strategies characteristic of expert human tutors, while producing longer, more lexically diverse, and more polite responses. Statistical analyses show that restating and revoicing, lexical diversity, and pressing for accuracy are positively associated with perceived pedagogical quality, whereas higher levels of agentic and polite language are negatively associated. Overall, recent large language models exhibit levels of perceived pedagogical quality comparable to expert human tutors, while relying on different instructional and linguistic strategies. These findings underscore the value of analyzing instructional strategies and linguistic characteristics when evaluating tutoring responses across human tutors and intelligent tutoring systems.

### [57] [Investigating Model Editing for Unlearning in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20794)
*Shariqah Hossain,Lalana Kagal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study explores adapting model editing algorithms (ROME, IKE, WISE) for machine unlearning, showing they can outperform traditional unlearning methods in controlled scenarios but struggle with balancing specificity and model integrity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unlearning methods for large language models (LLMs) face inefficiency or fail to remove targeted information without damaging retained knowledge. Model editing algorithms address similar challenges but focus on altering rather than removing knowledge, motivating their adaptation for unlearning tasks.

Method: Repurposed model editing algorithms (ROME, IKE, WISE) by redefining their training targets for unlearning scenarios. Designed experiments to compare their effectiveness against baseline unlearning methods in removing targeted information while preserving model performance.

Result: Model editing approaches achieved superior forgetting quality compared to traditional unlearning baselines in specific settings. However, all methods struggled to confine unlearning scope without negatively impacting unrelated knowledge retention.

Conclusion: Model editing algorithms demonstrate potential as competitive unlearning tools but highlight unresolved challenges in achieving precise, high-fidelity unlearning without compromising model robustness.

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove unwanted information from a model, but many methods are inefficient for LLMs with large numbers of parameters or fail to fully remove the intended information without degrading performance on knowledge that should be retained. Model editing algorithms solve a similar problem of changing information in models, but they focus on redirecting inputs to a new target rather than removing that information altogether. In this work, we explore the editing algorithms ROME, IKE, and WISE and design new editing targets for an unlearning setting. Through this investigation, we show that model editing approaches can exceed baseline unlearning methods in terms of quality of forgetting depending on the setting. Like traditional unlearning techniques, they struggle to encapsulate the scope of what is to be unlearned without damage to the overall model performance.

*Zhengyang Shan,Aaron Mueller*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文探究了大型语言模型中人口统计偏见机制与基础人口识别能力的关联性，研究发现通过稀疏自编码特征干预可选择性消除偏见，同时保留核心识别能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在厘清模型中的偏见机制是否独立于基础人口识别能力，为开发更精准的去偏方法提供理论依据，特别是在多任务学习场景下保持模型表现力的同时消除特定维度偏见。

Method: 采用多任务评估框架，结合姓名、职业、教育层级等人口属性关联场景，比较基于归因分析（attribution-based）和相关性分析（correlation-based）的特征定位方法，对Gemma-2-9B模型进行稀疏自编码特征消融实验。

Result: 归因分析消融有效缓解种族性别职业偏见并维持姓名识别准确率，而相关性分析更适用于教育偏见消除；发现教育任务中归因特征移除会导致先验分布塌缩从而增加整体偏见，证明特征维度需针对性干预。

Conclusion: 揭示人口偏见源于任务特定机制而非绝对人口标记，提出通过推理阶段机械化干预可实现精确去偏，同时验证了稀疏特征干预方法在保持核心能力前提下的有效性。

Abstract: We investigate how independent demographic bias mechanisms are from general demographic recognition in language models. Using a multi-task evaluation setup where demographics are associated with names, professions, and education levels, we measure whether models can be debiased while preserving demographic detection capabilities. We compare attribution-based and correlation-based methods for locating bias features. We find that targeted sparse autoencoder feature ablations in Gemma-2-9B reduce bias without degrading recognition performance: attribution-based ablations mitigate race and gender profession stereotypes while preserving name recognition accuracy, whereas correlation-based ablations are more effective for education bias. Qualitative analysis further reveals that removing attribution features in education tasks induces ``prior collapse'', thus increasing overall bias. This highlights the need for dimension-specific interventions. Overall, our results show that demographic bias arises from task-specific mechanisms rather than absolute demographic markers, and that mechanistic inference-time interventions can enable surgical debiasing without compromising core model capabilities.

### [59] [Semantic Deception: When Reasoning Models Can't Compute an Addition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20812)
*Nathaniël de Leeuw,Marceau Nahon,Mathis Reymond,Raja Chatila,Mehdi Khamassi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究发现大型语言模型（LLMs）在面对新符号系统和语义误导时，其推理能力存在显著局限性。即使处理简单任务，LLMs也容易受表层语义影响，依赖统计关联而非抽象符号操作，暴露出伦理风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs被过度归因‘推理能力’，但在需要稳健符号逻辑的决策场景（如医疗、司法）中，其依赖表面语义和统计关联的缺陷可能导致严重社会风险。研究旨在揭示LLMs是否具备真正的符号抽象能力及对语义误导的抵抗能力。

Method: 设计实验框架：1）使用新符号重新定义数字和数学符号；2）引入‘语义欺骗’（如将‘+’替换为干扰形态符号）；3）测试4种LLMs解决新符号下简单计算任务的表现；4）分析思维链（CoT）对语义依赖的影响。

Result: 所有LLMs在语义欺骗下表现显著下降（部分任务错误率超50%），即使正确执行任务时仍受干扰符号影响。证明其符号操作能力薄弱，且思维链反而强化统计关联依赖。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs的‘推理能力’本质是语义表面模式匹配，缺乏真正抽象逻辑操作能力。这一缺陷对依赖符号逻辑的关键决策领域（如医疗诊断、法律推理）构成潜在风险，需警惕LLMs的能力误判问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in situations where human values are at stake, such as decision-making tasks that involve reasoning when performed by humans. We investigate the so-called reasoning capabilities of LLMs over novel symbolic representations by introducing an experimental framework that tests their ability to process and manipulate unfamiliar symbols. We introduce semantic deceptions: situations in which symbols carry misleading semantic associations due to their form, such as being embedded in specific contexts, designed to probe whether LLMs can maintain symbolic abstraction or whether they default to exploiting learned semantic associations. We redefine standard digits and mathematical operators using novel symbols, and task LLMs with solving simple calculations expressed in this altered notation. The objective is: (1) to assess LLMs' capacity for abstraction and manipulation of arbitrary symbol systems; (2) to evaluate their ability to resist misleading semantic cues that conflict with the task's symbolic logic. Through experiments with four LLMs we show that semantic cues can significantly deteriorate reasoning models' performance on very simple tasks. They reveal limitations in current LLMs' ability for symbolic manipulations and highlight a tendency to over-rely on surface-level semantics, suggesting that chain-of-thoughts may amplify reliance on statistical correlations. Even in situations where LLMs seem to correctly follow instructions, semantic cues still impact basic capabilities. These limitations raise ethical and societal concerns, undermining the widespread and pernicious tendency to attribute reasoning abilities to LLMs and suggesting how LLMs might fail, in particular in decision-making contexts where robust symbolic reasoning is essential and should not be compromised by residual semantic associations inherited from the model's training.

TL;DR: 本论文提出了MediEval基准和CoRFu方法，通过整合真实患者数据和医学知识库，系统评估并改善医疗大语言模型的可靠性和安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医疗大语言模型评估方法存在两大缺陷：1)独立测试医学知识或2)患者级推理缺乏正确性验证，亟需结合知识基础与上下文一致性的系统性评估框架。

Method: 1)构建MediEval基准：将MIMIC-IV电子病历库与UMLS等医学知识图谱关联；2)设计四象限评估框架（知识基准x上下文一致性）；3)提出基于DPO的CoRFu微调方法，采用不对称惩罚策略处理危险错误。

Result: 1)发现当前模型存在幻觉支持和事实倒置等关键失效模式；2)CoRFu在宏F1指标上提升16.4分；3)完全消除事实倒置错误，同时提升准确率和安全性。

Conclusion: MediEval框架填补了医疗AI评估空白，CoRFu方法通过针对性优化有效平衡了安全性和准确性，为医疗大模型落地应用提供关键技术支撑。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to medicine, yet their adoption is limited by concerns over reliability and safety. Existing evaluations either test factual medical knowledge in isolation or assess patient-level reasoning without verifying correctness, leaving a critical gap. We introduce MediEval, a benchmark that links MIMIC-IV electronic health records (EHRs) to a unified knowledge base built from UMLS and other biomedical vocabularies. MediEval generates diverse factual and counterfactual medical statements within real patient contexts, enabling systematic evaluation across a 4-quadrant framework that jointly considers knowledge grounding and contextual consistency. Using this framework, we identify critical failure modes, including hallucinated support and truth inversion, that current proprietary, open-source, and domain-specific LLMs frequently exhibit. To address these risks, we propose Counterfactual Risk-Aware Fine-tuning (CoRFu), a DPO-based method with an asymmetric penalty targeting unsafe confusions. CoRFu improves by +16.4 macro-F1 points over the base model and eliminates truth inversion errors, demonstrating both higher accuracy and substantially greater safety.

### [62] [How important is Recall for Measuring Retrieval Quality?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20854)
*Shelly Schwartz,Oleg Vasilyev,Randy Sawaya*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses retrieval evaluation in scenarios with unknown relevant documents, comparing metrics correlations with LLM-based judgments and proposing a new retrieval quality measure effective for low-relevant-document datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Realistic retrieval settings often involve evolving knowledge bases where the total relevant documents count is unknown, making recall computation impossible. A reliable evaluation method without this requirement is needed.

Method: Experiments assessed established retrieval evaluation strategies by measuring correlations between metric scores and LLM-based response quality judgments across multiple datasets. A simple retrieval quality metric was proposed and tested.

Result: The proposed metric showed competitive performance without requiring knowledge of total relevant documents, validated through experiments on datasets containing 2-15 relevant documents.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that the proposed retrieval measure offers practical effectiveness evaluation in large-scale dynamic scenarios where recall cannot be calculated.

Abstract: In realistic retrieval settings with large and evolving knowledge bases, the total number of documents relevant to a query is typically unknown, and recall cannot be computed. In this paper, we evaluate several established strategies for handling this limitation by measuring the correlation between retrieval quality metrics and LLM-based judgments of response quality, where responses are generated from the retrieved documents. We conduct experiments across multiple datasets with a relatively low number of relevant documents (2-15). We also introduce a simple retrieval quality measure that performs well without requiring knowledge of the total number of relevant documents.

Abstract: We introduce the Nemotron 3 family of models - Nano, Super, and Ultra. These models deliver strong agentic, reasoning, and conversational capabilities. The Nemotron 3 family uses a Mixture-of-Experts hybrid Mamba-Transformer architecture to provide best-in-class throughput and context lengths of up to 1M tokens. Super and Ultra models are trained with NVFP4 and incorporate LatentMoE, a novel approach that improves model quality. The two larger models also include MTP layers for faster text generation. All Nemotron 3 models are post-trained using multi-environment reinforcement learning enabling reasoning, multi-step tool use, and support granular reasoning budget control. Nano, the smallest model, outperforms comparable models in accuracy while remaining extremely cost-efficient for inference. Super is optimized for collaborative agents and high-volume workloads such as IT ticket automation. Ultra, the largest model, provides state-of-the-art accuracy and reasoning performance. Nano is released together with its technical report and this white paper, while Super and Ultra will follow in the coming months. We will openly release the model weights, pre- and post-training software, recipes, and all data for which we hold redistribution rights.

### [64] [Architectural Trade-offs in Small Language Models Under Compute Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20877)
*Shivraj Singh Bhatti*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文系统研究了计算资源受限下的小型语言模型，发现基于注意力机制的模型在小型规模下仍具有更高的每FLOP效率，而盲目增加深度或上下文可能损害性能，且部分大语言模型技术（如RoPE）不适用于小型模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在明确在严格计算约束下，模型架构选择与训练预算如何共同影响性能，并填补小型语言模型与大语言模型优化策略差异的空白。

Method: 从线性预测器逐步引入非线性和多层Transformer架构，在Tiny Shakespeare、PTB和WikiText-2上使用测试负对数似然、参数量及训练FLOPs评估模型，对比注意力模型与MLP的效率，测试RoPE等技术的迁移效果。

Result: 注意力模型在小型模型中比MLP更高效；未充分优化时增加深度或上下文长度会降低性能；RoPE对小型模型增益有限，表明大模型的成功技术需针对性调整。

Conclusion: 小型语言模型设计应优先考虑注意力机制，但需谨慎优化深度/上下文和位置编码方法，避免直接套用大模型策略。

Abstract: We present a systematic empirical study of small language models under strict compute constraints, analyzing how architectural choices and training budget interact to determine performance. Starting from a linear next-token predictor, we progressively introduce nonlinearities, self-attention, and multi-layer transformer architectures, evaluating each on character-level modeling of Tiny Shakespeare and word-level modeling of Penn Treebank (PTB) and WikiText-2. We compare models using test negative log-likelihood (NLL), parameter count, and approximate training FLOPs to characterize accuracy-efficiency trade-offs. Our results show that attention-based models dominate MLPs in per-FLOP efficiency even at small scale, while increasing depth or context without sufficient optimization can degrade performance. We further examine rotary positional embeddings (RoPE), finding that architectural techniques successful in large language models do not necessarily transfer to small-model regimes.

Conclusion: 谱系追踪框架有效揭示蒸馏机制，教师引导选择策略超越启发式方法，建议向社区共享该框架。

Abstract: Reasoning distillation has attracted increasing attention. It typically leverages a large teacher model to generate reasoning paths, which are then used to fine-tune a student model so that it mimics the teacher's behavior in training contexts. However, previous approaches have lacked a detailed analysis of the origins of the distilled model's capabilities. It remains unclear whether the student can maintain consistent behaviors with the teacher in novel test-time contexts, or whether it regresses to its original output patterns, raising concerns about the generalization of distillation models. To analyse this question, we introduce a cross-model Reasoning Distillation Provenance Tracing framework. For each action (e.g., a sentence) produced by the distilled model, we obtain the predictive probabilities assigned by the teacher, the original student, and the distilled model under the same context. By comparing these probabilities, we classify each action into different categories. By systematically disentangling the provenance of each action, we experimentally demonstrate that, in test-time contexts, the distilled model can indeed generate teacher-originated actions, which correlate with and plausibly explain observed performance on distilled model. Building on this analysis, we further propose a teacher-guided data selection method. Unlike prior approach that rely on heuristics, our method directly compares teacher-student divergences on the training data, providing a principled selection criterion. We validate the effectiveness of our approach across multiple representative teacher models and diverse student models. The results highlight the utility of our provenance-tracing framework and underscore its promise for reasoning distillation. We hope to share Reasoning Distillation Provenance Tracing and our insights into reasoning distillation with the community.

TL;DR: FEND框架通过多模态融合检测神经精神疾病，发现多语言和任务异质性挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经精神疾病（AD、抑郁、ASD）需可靠生物标志物，但多模态方法缺乏多语言泛化和统一评估框架。

Method: 提出FEND框架，整合语音与文本模态，基于13种多语言数据集系统评估融合效果。

Result: 多模态在AD/抑郁中表现优异，但ASD因数据异质性欠佳，且存在模态不平衡问题；跨语料实验显示语言/任务一致性场景性能下降。

Conclusion: FEND为自动化多语言疾病终身评估提供基准，推动领域可重复研究，呼吁采用该框架。

Abstract: Neuropsychiatric disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), depression, and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), are characterized by linguistic and acoustic abnormalities, offering potential biomarkers for early detection. Despite the promise of multi-modal approaches, challenges like multi-lingual generalization and the absence of a unified evaluation framework persist. To address these gaps, we propose FEND (Foundation model-based Evaluation of Neuropsychiatric Disorders), a comprehensive multi-modal framework integrating speech and text modalities for detecting AD, depression, and ASD across the lifespan. Leveraging 13 multi-lingual datasets spanning English, Chinese, Greek, French, and Dutch, we systematically evaluate multi-modal fusion performance. Our results show that multi-modal fusion excels in AD and depression detection but underperforms in ASD due to dataset heterogeneity. We also identify modality imbalance as a prevalent issue, where multi-modal fusion fails to surpass the best mono-modal models. Cross-corpus experiments reveal robust performance in task- and language-consistent scenarios but noticeable degradation in multi-lingual and task-heterogeneous settings. By providing extensive benchmarks and a detailed analysis of performance-influencing factors, FEND advances the field of automated, lifespan-inclusive, and multi-lingual neuropsychiatric disorder assessment. We encourage researchers to adopt the FEND framework for fair comparisons and reproducible research.

In an era where misinformation spreads rapidly, effective fact-checking is increasingly critical. We introduce TriAligner, a novel approach that leverages a dual-encoder architecture with contrastive learning and incorporates both native and English translations across different modalities. Our method effectively retrieves claims across multiple languages by learning the relative importance of different sources in alignment. To enhance robustness, we employ efficient data preprocessing and augmentation using large language models while incorporating hard negative sampling to improve representation learning. We evaluate our approach on monolingual and crosslingual benchmarks, demonstrating significant improvements in retrieval accuracy and fact-checking performance over baselines.

### [68] [Reflection Pretraining Enables Token-Level Self-Correction in Biological Sequence Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20954)
*Xiang Zhang,Jiaqi Wei,Yuejin Yang,Zijie Qiu,Yuhan Chen,Zhiqiang Gao,Muhammad Abdul-Mageed,Laks V. S. Lakshmanan,Wanli Ouyang,Chenyu You,Siqi Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces 'reflection pretraining' to enable Chain-of-Thought (CoT) style reasoning in biological language models (e.g., protein/RNA) by enhancing token space expressiveness through auxiliary 'thinking tokens', overcoming limitations of traditional CoT application in low-expressive domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CoT prompting in NLP relies on rich token spaces to generate intermediate reasoning steps, but biological sequence models (e.g., protein language models) lack sufficient linguistic expressiveness (due to limited token vocabulary like amino acid sequences) to support complex reasoning processes like error correction or self-reflection.

Method: 1) Theorize 'language expressiveness' as the ability to encode information via tokens/grammar, 2) Propose reflection pretraining using learnable 'thinking tokens' to augment biological language spaces, and 3) Validate through mathematical analysis of token space expansion and empirical comparison against standard pretraining methods.

Result: Reflection pretraining theoretically expanded expressiveness in biological language models, demonstrated practical self-correction capabilities in protein models, and achieved significant performance improvements over conventional pretraining approaches in experimental validations.

Conclusion: The study establishes that explicit enhancement of linguistic expressiveness through reflection pretraining enables intermediate reasoning in previously intractable domains, providing a critical theoretical and technical framework to bridge CoT-style reasoning gaps between NLP and biological sequence modeling.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has significantly advanced task-solving capabilities in natural language processing with large language models. Unlike standard prompting, CoT encourages the model to generate intermediate reasoning steps, non-answer tokens, that help guide the model toward more accurate final outputs. These intermediate steps enable more complex reasoning processes such as error correction, memory management, future planning, and self-reflection. However, applying CoT to non-natural language domains, such as protein and RNA language models, is not yet possible, primarily due to the limited expressiveness of their token spaces (e.g., amino acid tokens). In this work, we propose and define the concept of language expressiveness: the ability of a given language, using its tokens and grammar, to encode information. We show that the limited expressiveness of protein language severely restricts the applicability of CoT-style reasoning. To overcome this, we introduce reflection pretraining, for the first time in a biological sequence model, which enables the model to engage in intermediate reasoning through the generation of auxiliary "thinking tokens" beyond simple answer tokens. Theoretically, we demonstrate that our augmented token set significantly enhances biological language expressiveness, thereby improving the overall reasoning capacity of the model. Experimentally, our pretraining approach teaches protein models to self-correct and leads to substantial performance gains compared to standard pretraining.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床场景中需要高效复现LLM错误，传统手动标注效率低，且缺乏标准化评估体系。

Method: 1. 用LLM模拟患者与医生生成对话数据；2. 通过双LLM评审委员会多维度评估错误；3. 将错误转换为单次问答形式构建基准（MedMistake-Bench）。

Result: GPT-4o、Claude 4.5等模型在专家验证的211个问题（MedMistake-Bench）中表现最优，但GPT-5在MedMistake-All整体表现仍不理想。

Conclusion: MedMistake提供可扩展的自动化医疗错误检测框架，所构建的医疗大模型评估基准具有实用价值，已开源数据集促进领域发展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly evaluated in clinical settings using multi-dimensional rubrics which quantify reasoning quality, safety, and patient-centeredness. Yet, replicating specific mistakes in other LLM models is not straightforward and often requires manual effort. We introduce MedMistake, an automatic pipeline that extracts mistakes LLMs make in patient-doctor conversations and converts them into a benchmark of single-shot QA pairs. Our pipeline (1) creates complex, conversational data between an LLM patient and LLM doctor, (2) runs an evaluation with a committee of 2 LLM judges across a variety of dimensions and (3) creates simplified single-shot QA scenarios from those mistakes. We release MedMistake-All, a dataset of 3,390 single-shot QA pairs where GPT-5 and Gemini 2.5 Pro are currently failing to answer correctly, as judged by two LLM judges. We used medical experts to validate a subset of 211/3390 questions (MedMistake-Bench), which we used to run a final evaluation of 12 frontier LLMs: Claude Opus 4.5, Claude Sonnet 4.5, DeepSeek-Chat, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Gemini 3 Pro, GPT-4o, GPT-5, GPT-5.1, GPT-5.2, Grok 4, Grok 4.1, Mistral Large. We found that GPT models, Claude and Grok obtained the best performance on MedMistake-Bench. We release both the doctor-validated benchmark (MedMistake-Bench), as well as the full dataset (MedMistake-All) at https://huggingface.co/datasets/TheLumos/MedicalMistakeBenchmark.

TL;DR: 本文提出通过仅蒸馏链式推理（CoT）分段并截断序列前50%，可在保持94%性能的同时降低50%计算资源消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统知识蒸馏需处理长序列（Prompt+CoT+Answer）导致资源消耗过高，本研究旨在探索不同分段监督对性能的影响，并寻找计算效率与质量的平衡点。

Method: ①分析不同分段（P/COT/A）监督权重对效果的影响 ②提出动态序列截断协议，量化序列长度与性能/资源的关联性 ③在数学基准数据上验证截断前50% token的效果。

Result: ①CoT分段监督可替代P/A分段 ②截断前50%序列：性能保留94%，训练时间/内存/FLOPs均降低50% ③早期推理token对结果影响更大。

Conclusion: 推理蒸馏应优先早期CoT分段，截断协议为计算资源优化提供了有效控制杠杆。

Abstract: Distilling the reasoning capabilities from a large language model (LLM) to a smaller student model often involves training on substantial amounts of reasoning data. However, distillation over lengthy sequences with prompt (P), chain-of-thought (CoT), and answer (A) segments makes the process computationally expensive. In this work, we investigate how the allocation of supervision across different segments (P, CoT, A) affects student performance. Our analysis shows that selective knowledge distillation over only the CoT tokens can be effective when the prompt and answer information is encompassed by it. Building on this insight, we establish a truncation protocol to quantify computation-quality tradeoffs as a function of sequence length. We observe that training on only the first $50\%$ of tokens of every training sequence can retain, on average, $\approx94\%$ of full-sequence performance on math benchmarks while reducing training time, memory usage, and FLOPs by about $50\%$ each. These findings suggest that reasoning distillation benefits from prioritizing early reasoning tokens and provides a simple lever for computation-quality tradeoffs.

TL;DR: 本文提出SFTKey方法，解决传统监督微调中模型过度关注推理过程而忽视关键答案的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SFT导致模型过度关注长链推理(CoT)序列，削弱对答案部分的注意力，而答案正确性直接决定任务成败。

Method: SFTKey采用两阶段训练：第一阶段常规SFT确保输出格式，第二阶段仅对关键答案部分微调以优化准确性。

Result: 在多基准测试中，SFTKey相较传统SFT平均提升5%以上准确率，同时保持正确格式生成能力。

Conclusion: 该研究通过平衡CoT学习与答案相关token优化，显著提升LLM微调效果，验证了关键部分专项优化的有效性。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) component has become significant for complex reasoning tasks. However, in conventional Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), the model could allocate disproportionately more attention to CoT sequences with excessive length. This reduces focus on the much shorter but essential Key portion-the final answer, whose correctness directly determines task success and evaluation quality. To address this limitation, we propose SFTKey, a two-stage training scheme. In the first stage, conventional SFT is applied to ensure proper output format, while in the second stage, only the Key portion is fine-tuned to improve accuracy. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and model families demonstrate that SFTKey achieves an average accuracy improvement exceeding 5\% over conventional SFT, while preserving the ability to generate correct formats. Overall, this study advances LLM fine-tuning by explicitly balancing CoT learning with additional optimization on answer-relevant tokens.

Motivation: 现有安全分类器依赖大量人工标注数据，但数据获取困难、易含标注错误或依赖合成数据，亟需减少对标注数据的依赖。

Method: 采用半监督学习技术（如伪标签、一致性正则化）处理安全分类任务，引入任务特定的数据增强策略，并与通用增强技术对比实验。

Result: 半监督学习方法在提示请求和模型响应的安全性评估中均显著提升性能，任务特定增强相较通用增强效果更优。

Conclusion: 通过结合有/无标签数据和定制增强技术，该方案有效缓解标注数据不足问题，为LLM安全性提供了更高效可持续的解决方案。

Abstract: Safety for Large Language Models (LLMs) has been an ongoing research focus since their emergence and is even more relevant nowadays with the increasing capacity of those models. Currently, there are several guardrails in place for all public LLMs and multiple proposed datasets for training safety classifiers. However, training these safety classifiers relies on large quantities of labeled data, which can be problematic to acquire, prone to labeling errors, or often include synthetic data. To address these issues, we suggest a different approach: utilizing semi-supervised learning techniques, which leverage both labeled and unlabeled data, to improve the performance on the safety task. We analyze the improvements that these techniques can offer for both prompts given to Large Language Models and the responses to those requests. Moreover, since augmentation is the central part of semi-supervised algorithms, we demonstrate the importance of using task-specific augmentations, which significantly increase the performance when compared to general-purpose augmentation techniques.

Motivation: 传统基于大语言模型的澄清评估主要假设单轮对话或合作型用户，无法体现真实场景中的不完整信息与多轮互动需求。

Method: 构建了一个包含五维模糊分类体系和六种模拟用户角色的ClarifyMT-Bench基准，利用LLM-人类混合流水线生成6120轮对话数据集，并提出采用感知、预测、追踪与规划四模块的ClarifyAgent解决方案。

Result: 发现大语言模型普遍存在过早回答的倾向，对话深度增加时性能下降；采用ClarifyAgent方法后在多重模糊场景下表现出显著增强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ClarifyMT-Bench为研究大语言模型何时应提问、何时应回答及如何处理模糊性提供了可复现的基准框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as conversational assistants in open-domain, multi-turn settings, where users often provide incomplete or ambiguous information. However, existing LLM-focused clarification benchmarks primarily assume single-turn interactions or cooperative users, limiting their ability to evaluate clarification behavior in realistic settings. We introduce \textbf{ClarifyMT-Bench}, a benchmark for multi-turn clarification grounded in a five-dimensional ambiguity taxonomy and a set of six behaviorally diverse simulated user personas. Through a hybrid LLM-human pipeline, we construct 6,120 multi-turn dialogues capturing diverse ambiguity sources and interaction patterns. Evaluating ten representative LLMs uncovers a consistent under-clarification bias: LLMs tend to answer prematurely, and performance degrades as dialogue depth increases. To mitigate this, we propose \textbf{ClarifyAgent}, an agentic approach that decomposes clarification into perception, forecasting, tracking, and planning, substantially improving robustness across ambiguity conditions. ClarifyMT-Bench establishes a reproducible foundation for studying when LLMs should ask, when they should answer, and how to navigate ambiguity in real-world human-LLM interactions.

Abstract: Human infants, with only a few hundred hours of speech exposure, acquire basic units of new languages, highlighting a striking efficiency gap compared to the data-hungry self-supervised speech models. To address this gap, this paper introduces SpidR-Adapt for rapid adaptation to new languages using minimal unlabeled data. We cast such low-resource speech representation learning as a meta-learning problem and construct a multi-task adaptive pre-training (MAdaPT) protocol which formulates the adaptation process as a bi-level optimization framework. To enable scalable meta-training under this framework, we propose a novel heuristic solution, first-order bi-level optimization (FOBLO), avoiding heavy computation costs. Finally, we stabilize meta-training by using a robust initialization through interleaved supervision which alternates self-supervised and supervised objectives. Empirically, SpidR-Adapt achieves rapid gains in phonemic discriminability (ABX) and spoken language modeling (sWUGGY, sBLIMP, tSC), improving over in-domain language models after training on less than 1h of target-language audio, over $100\times$ more data-efficient than standard training. These findings highlight a practical, architecture-agnostic path toward biologically inspired, data-efficient representations. We open-source the training code and model checkpoints at https://github.com/facebookresearch/spidr-adapt.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出PTP框架，通过单次transformer调用联合预测多个相关token，实现语言模型的高效并行序列生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有并行序列生成方法存在自回归解码延迟瓶颈和独立假设限制，需要更灵活高效的方法。

Method: 将采样过程整合进模型，单次预测多个依赖token，训练可用知识蒸馏或逆自回归训练，理论证明可表示任意自回归分布。

Result: 在Vicuna-7B的Spec-Bench中每步接受超4个token，推测解码性能达SOTA。

Conclusion: PTP框架通用，支持无需建模能力损失的长序列并行生成，验证理论可行性与实际有效性。

Abstract: We propose Parallel Token Prediction (PTP), a universal framework for parallel sequence generation in language models. PTP jointly predicts multiple dependent tokens in a single transformer call by incorporating the sampling procedure into the model. This reduces the latency bottleneck of autoregressive decoding, and avoids the restrictive independence assumptions common in existing multi-token prediction methods. We prove that PTP can represent arbitrary autoregressive sequence distributions. PTP is trained either by distilling an existing model or through inverse autoregressive training without a teacher. Experimentally, we achieve state-of-the-art speculative decoding performance on Vicuna-7B by accepting over four tokens per step on Spec-Bench. The universality of our framework indicates that parallel generation of long sequences is feasible without loss of modeling power.

*Xinhe Wang,Jin Huang,Xingjian Zhang,Tianhao Wang,Jiaqi W. Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文发现传统推理基准测试（如ARC）的表现差距主要源于视觉感知限制，而非机器推理能力缺陷。通过分阶段实验分离感知与推理过程，证明80%模型错误源于感知错误，揭示了基准测试混淆两者的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统认为前沿视觉语言模型（VLMs）在ARC等推理基准测试中的落后表现是推理能力不足导致，但作者提出新假设：该差距主要源于视觉感知能力的限制。

Method: 设计两阶段实验：第一阶段将图像独立转换为自然语言描述（隔离感知过程）；第二阶段使用这些描述进行推理（独立验证归纳能力）。通过对比端到端与分阶段效果，量化感知与推理的相互影响。

Result: 1) 在Mini-ARC/ACRE/Bongard-LOGO三大数据集验证感知主导性能差距；2) 80%模型失败源自感知错误；3) 手动分析显示跨图像归纳信息未泄漏；4) 端到端性能差距被错误归因于推理缺陷。

Conclusion: ARC类基准测试混淆了感知与推理挑战，导致夸大机器推理缺陷。研究强调智能评估必须解耦感知与推理过程，为设计更精准认知测试提供理论依据。

Abstract: Reasoning benchmarks such as the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) and ARC-AGI are widely used to assess progress in artificial intelligence and are often interpreted as probes of core, so-called ``fluid'' reasoning abilities. Despite their apparent simplicity for humans, these tasks remain challenging for frontier vision-language models (VLMs), a gap commonly attributed to deficiencies in machine reasoning. We challenge this interpretation and hypothesize that the gap arises primarily from limitations in visual perception rather than from shortcomings in inductive reasoning.
  To verify this hypothesis, we introduce a two-stage experimental pipeline that explicitly separates perception and reasoning. In the perception stage, each image is independently converted into a natural-language description, while in the reasoning stage a model induces and applies rules using these descriptions. This design prevents leakage of cross-image inductive signals and isolates reasoning from perception bottlenecks. Across three ARC-style datasets, Mini-ARC, ACRE, and Bongard-LOGO, we show that the perception capability is the dominant factor underlying the observed performance gap by comparing the two-stage pipeline with against standard end-to-end one-stage evaluation. Manual inspection of reasoning traces in the VLM outputs further reveals that approximately 80 percent of model failures stem from perception errors. Together, these results demonstrate that ARC-style benchmarks conflate perceptual and reasoning challenges and that observed performance gaps may overstate deficiencies in machine reasoning. Our findings underscore the need for evaluation protocols that disentangle perception from reasoning when assessing progress in machine intelligence.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: C2LLM引入基于多头注意力的池化（PMA）模块，通过改进代码序列嵌入生成方法，在保持LLM预训练因果表示的同时突破EOS瓶颈，实现灵活维度适配，其7B模型在MTEB-Code同规模模型中性能登顶。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统EOS-based序列嵌入存在信息瓶颈且维度固定，无法充分利用预训练LLM的因果表示。现有方法（如MRL）在代码表示任务中受限，亟需更灵活高效的序列嵌入聚合方案。

Method: 在Qwen-2.5-Coder基座上设计PMA模块：1) 通过多头注意力机制聚合全部token信息；2) 保留因果语言模型预训练获得的上下文感知能力；3) 支持动态调整嵌入维度。模型使用300万公开代码数据进行对比学习训练。

Result: C2LLM-7B在MTEB-Code基准测试中超过同规模模型，取得榜单第一；0.5B和7B模型均刷新各自参数量级的性能记录，验证了PMA架构在代码搜索、相似性检测等下游任务的有效性。

Conclusion: PMA模块成功解决序列嵌入的信息压制问题，提供可微分维度适配方案。实验表明C2LLM在保持计算效率的同时显著提升代码表征能力，为代码智能任务提供新的架构范式。

Abstract: We present C2LLM - Contrastive Code Large Language Models, a family of code embedding models in both 0.5B and 7B sizes. Building upon Qwen-2.5-Coder backbones, C2LLM adopts a Pooling by Multihead Attention (PMA) module for generating sequence embedding from token embeddings, effectively 1) utilizing the LLM's causal representations acquired during pretraining, while also 2) being able to aggregate information from all tokens in the sequence, breaking the information bottleneck in EOS-based sequence embeddings, and 3) supporting flexible adaptation of embedding dimension, serving as an alternative to MRL. Trained on three million publicly available data, C2LLM models set new records on MTEB-Code among models of similar sizes, with C2LLM-7B ranking 1st on the overall leaderboard.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的衡量生成过程不确定性的指标Denosing Entropy，并基于此开发了两种优化解码路径的算法，显著提升了Masked Diffusion Models的生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs)存在生成结果对解码顺序敏感的核心问题，该文首次将此问题形式化，指出输出质量波动源于生成路径中累积的预测不确定性。

Method: 提出Denosing Entropy作为可计算的生成过程评估指标，设计了事后路径选择方法和实时引导策略两种优化解码路径的算法，通过实验验证其有效性。

Result: 实验表明熵引导方法显著提升生成质量，在需复杂推理、规划和代码生成的基准测试中准确率持续提升，成功将MDM的不确定性弱点转化为发现高质量解的优势。

Conclusion: 为理解控制生成过程提供了理论工具，证明通过量化预测熵可将不确定性转化为优化生成路径的关键依据，在多个任务中展现实际应用价值。

Abstract: Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) offer flexible, non-autoregressive generation, but this freedom introduces a challenge: final output quality is highly sensitive to the decoding order. We are the first to formalize this issue, attributing the variability in output quality to the cumulative predictive uncertainty along a generative path. To quantify this uncertainty, we introduce Denoising Entropy, a computable metric that serves as an internal signal for evaluating generative process. Leveraging this metric, we propose two algorithms designed to optimize the decoding path: a post-hoc selection method and a real-time guidance strategy. Experiments demonstrate that our entropy-guided methods significantly improve generation quality, consistently boosting accuracy on challenging reasoning, planning, and code benchmarks. Our work establishes Denoising Entropy as a principled tool for understanding and controlling generation, effectively turning the uncertainty in MDMs from a liability into a key advantage for discovering high-quality solutions.
