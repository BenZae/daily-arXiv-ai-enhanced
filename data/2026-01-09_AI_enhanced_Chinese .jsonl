This limits alignment with complex human expertise, which is hierarchical and fine-grained. To address this, we first construct a hierarchical, fine-grained evaluation criteria with domain experts, which decomposes image quality into multiple positive and negative attributes organized in a tree structure. Building on this, we propose a two-stage alignment framework. First, we inject domain knowledge to an auxiliary diffusion model via Supervised Fine-Tuning. Second, we introduce Complex Preference Optimization (CPO) that extends DPO to align the target diffusion to our non-binary, hierarchical criteria. Specifically, we reformulate the alignment problem to simultaneously maximize the probability of positive attributes while minimizing the probability of negative attributes with the auxiliary diffusion. We instantiate our approach in the domain of painting generation and conduct CPO training with an annotated dataset of painting with fine-grained attributes based on our criteria. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CPO significantly enhances generation quality and alignment with expertise, opening new avenues for fine-grained criteria alignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\uff08CPO\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u5206\u5c42\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u4e13\u4e1a\u5bf9\u9f50\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u7b80\u5316\u4fe1\u53f7\uff08\u5982\u4e8c\u5143\u504f\u597d\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5339\u914d\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u5c42\u7ea7\u6027\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u679c\u504f\u79bb\u4e13\u4e1a\u9884\u671f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u6ce8\u5165\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u5230\u8f85\u52a9\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff1b2) CPO\u7b97\u6cd5\u6269\u5c55DPO\uff0c\u5c06\u5c42\u7ea7\u975e\u4e8c\u5143\u6807\u51c6\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u540c\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u6b63\u5c5e\u6027\u6982\u7387\u5e76\u6291\u5236\u8d1f\u5c5e\u6027\u6982\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7ed8\u753b\u751f\u6210\u9886\u57df\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0cCPO\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u8d85\u8d8a\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5c5e\u6027\u5bf9\u9f50\u7387\u8fbe\u5230\u4e13\u4e1a\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u4e14\u901a\u8fc7\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "CPO\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u5c42\u7ea7\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u77e5\u8bc6\u6ce8\u5165\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u62d3\u5c55\u81f3\u5176\u4ed6\u4e13\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u3002"}}

Existing methods predominantly rely on least and most significant bit (LSB & MSB) manipulation, Pixel Value Differencing (PVD), spatial perturbations in RGB channels, transform domain based methods, Quantization methods, Edge and Region based methods and more recently through deep learning methods and generative AI techniques for hiding textual information in spatial domain of images. Most of them are dependent on pixel intensity flipping over multiple pixels, such as LSB and combination of LSB based methodologies, and on transform coefficients, often resulting in the form of noise. Encoding and Decoding are deterministic in most of the existing approaches and are computationally heavy in case of higher models such as deep learning and gen AI approaches. The proposed method works on quinary pixel intensity combinations in RGB space, where five controlled different pixel intensity variations in each of the R, G, and B channels formulate up to one hundred and twenty five distinct pixel intensity combinations. These combinations are mapped to textual symbols, enabling the representation of uppercase and lowercase alphabetic characters, numeric digits, whitespace, and commonly used special characters. Different metrics such as MSE, MAE, SNR, PSNR, SSIM, Histogram Comparison and Heatmap analysis, were evaluated for both original and encoded images resulting in no significant distortion in the images. Furthermore, the method achieves improved embedding efficiency by encoding a complete textual symbol within a single RGB pixel, in contrast to LSB and MSB based approaches that typically require multiple pixels or multi-step processes, as well as transform and learning based methods that incur higher computational overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper introduces a quinary RGB pixel intensity combination method for text-image embedding, achieving efficient text hiding per pixel with minimal distortion compared to traditional LSB/MSB or learning-based approaches.", "motivation": "Existing steganography methods suffer from computational heaviness, noise artifacts, and multi-pixel requirements.

This separate, sequential inference process limits cross-modal coupling and prohibits automatic multimodal generation. This work explores post-training to achieve fully unified text-image generation, where models autonomously transition from textual reasoning to visual synthesis within a single inference process. We examine the impact of joint text-image generation on T2I performance and the relative importance of each modality during post-training. We additionally explore different post-training data strategies, showing that a targeted dataset addressing specific limitations achieves superior results compared to broad image-caption corpora or benchmark-aligned data.

Nonetheless, these models have significant storage requirements for large and medium-sized scenes, hindering their deployment over cloud and streaming services.

While effective, scalar quantization may not optimally capture the correlations of high-dimensional feature vectors, which can potentially limit the rate-distortion performance.\n  In this work, we introduce a novel progressive codec for 3D Gaussian Splatting that replaces traditional methods with a more powerful Residual Vector Quantization approach to compress the primitive features.

Such models rely on the KV-cache mechanism to reduce attention computation from O(T^2) to O(T); however, KV-cache size grows linearly with the number of generated tokens, and it rapidly becomes the dominant bottleneck limiting inference efficiency and generative length. Unified autoregressive video generation inherits this limitation. Our analysis reveals that KV-cache tokens exhibit distinct spatiotemporal properties: (i) text and conditioning-image tokens act as persistent semantic anchors that consistently receive high attention, and (ii) attention to previous frames naturally decays with temporal distance. Leveraging these observations, we introduce PackCache, a training-free KV-cache management method that dynamically compacts the KV cache through three coordinated mechanisms: condition anchoring that preserves semantic references, cross-frame decay modeling that allocates cache budget according to temporal distance, and spatially preserving position embedding that maintains coherent 3D structure under cache removal. In terms of efficiency, PackCache accelerates end-to-end generation by 1.7-2.2x on 48-frame long sequences, showcasing its strong potential for enabling longer-sequence video generation. Notably, the final four frames - the portion most impacted by the progressively expanding KV-cache and thus the most expensive segment of the clip - PackCache delivers a 2.6x and 3.7x acceleration on A40 and H200, respectively, for 48-frame videos.", "AI": {"tldr": "PackCache\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u538b\u7f29KV\u7f13\u5b58\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u7edf\u4e00\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b01.7-2.2\u500d\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "motivation": "\u7edf\u4e00\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u7684KV\u7f13\u5b58\u968f\u751f\u6210token\u7ebf\u6027\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u6210\u4e3a\u9650\u5236\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u548c\u751f\u6210\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684PackCache\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u6761\u4ef6\u951a\u5b9a\uff08\u4fdd\u7559\u8bed\u4e49\u951a\u70b9\uff09\u3001\u8de8\u5e27\u8870\u51cf\u5efa\u6a21\uff08\u6309\u65f6\u95f4\u8ddd\u79bb\u5206\u914d\u7f13\u5b58\u9884\u7b97\uff09\u53ca\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5d4c\u5165\u4fdd\u62a4\uff08\u4fdd\u63013D\u7ed3\u6784\u8fde\u8d2f\uff09\u4e09\u673a\u5236\u534f\u8c03\u538b\u7f29\u7f13\u5b58", "result": "48\u5e27\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u540e\u56db\u5e27\uff08\u6210\u672c\u6700\u9ad8\u90e8\u5206\uff09\u5728A40/H200\u663e\u5361\u5b9e\u73b02.6x/3.7x\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u6574\u4f53\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u52a0\u901f1.7-2.2\u500d", "conclusion": "PackCache\u7a81\u7834KV\u7f13\u5b58\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7edf\u4e00\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u751f\u6210\u6548\u7387"}}

We present Collective Narrative Grounding, a participatory protocol that transforms community stories into structured narrative units and integrates them into AI systems under community governance. Learning from three participatory mapping workshops with N=24 community members, we designed elicitation methods and a schema that retain narrative richness while enabling entity, time, and place extraction, validation, and provenance control. To scope the problem, we audit a county-level benchmark of 14,782 local information QA pairs, where factual gaps, cultural misunderstandings, geographic confusions, and temporal misalignments account for 76.7% of errors. On a participatory QA set derived from our workshops, a state-of-the-art LLM answered fewer than 21% of questions correctly without added context, underscoring the need for local grounding.

We study whether a single flow-matching foundation model pre-trained primarily on RGB images can be repurposed as a cross-spectral translator using only a few co-measured examples, and whether the resulting synthetic data can enhance downstream detection. Starting from FLUX.1 Kontext, we insert low-rank adaptation (LoRA) modules and fine-tune them on just 100 paired images per domain for two settings: RGB to IR on the KAIST dataset and RGB to SAR on the M4-SAR dataset. The adapted model translates RGB images into pixel-aligned IR/SAR, enabling us to reuse existing bounding boxes and train object detection models purely in the target modality. Across a grid of LoRA hyperparameters, we find that LPIPS computed on only 50 held-out pairs is a strong proxy for downstream performance: lower LPIPS consistently predicts higher mAP for YOLOv11n on both IR and SAR, and for DETR on KAIST IR test data. Using the best LPIPS-selected LoRA adapter, synthetic IR from external RGB datasets (LLVIP, FLIR ADAS) improves KAIST IR pedestrian detection, and synthetic SAR significantly boosts infrastructure detection on M4-SAR when combined with limited real SAR.

However, recent studies show that LLMs perform poorly on telecom standards, particularly 3GPP specifications. We argue that a key reason is that these standards densely include tables to present essential information, yet the LLM knowledge and interpretation ability of such tables remains largely unexamined. To address this gap, we introduce TeleTables, a benchmark designed to evaluate both the implicit knowledge LLMs have about tables in technical specifications and their explicit ability to interpret them. TeleTables is built through a novel multi-stage data generation pipeline that extracts tables from 3GPP standards and uses multimodal and reasoning-oriented LLMs to generate and validate questions. The resulting dataset, which is publicly available, comprises 500 human-verified question-answer pairs, each associated with the corresponding table in multiple formats. Our evaluation shows that, smaller models (under 10B parameters) struggle both to recall 3GPP knowledge and to interpret tables, indicating the limited exposure to telecom standards in their pretraining and the insufficient inductive biases for navigating complex technical material. Larger models, on the other hand, show stronger reasoning on table interpretation. Overall, TeleTables highlights the need for domain-specialized fine-tuning to reliably interpret and reason over telecom standards.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86TeleTables\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u89e3\u8bfb3GPP\u901a\u4fe1\u6807\u51c6\u8868\u683c\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5c0f\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u56de\u987e\u548c\u8868\u683c\u89e3\u8bfb\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u800c\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u4f73\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u7528\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1LLMs\u5728\u7535\u4fe1\u884c\u4e1a\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u57283GPP\u901a\u4fe1\u6807\u51c6\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u8868\u683c\u5316\u4fe1\u606f\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u5dee\u3002\u5f53\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9LLMs\u8868\u683c\u89e3\u8bfb\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaTeleTables\u57fa\u51c6\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u6d41\u7a0b\u63d0\u53d63GPP\u6807\u51c6\u8868\u683c\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u578bLLMs\u751f\u6210\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u5f62\u6210\u5305\u542b500\u7ec4\u4eba\u5de5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u95ee\u7b54\u5bf9\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u5c0f\u578b\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u53c2\u6570<10B\uff09\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u56de\u987e\u4e0e\u8868\u683c\u89e3\u8bfb\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7535\u4fe1\u6807\u51c6\u8986\u76d6\u4e0d\u8db3\uff1b\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8868\u683c\u63a8\u7406\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u5f3a\uff0c\u4f46\u6574\u4f53\u4ecd\u9700\u9886\u57df\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "TeleTables\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709LLMs\u5728\u7535\u4fe1\u6807\u51c6\u8868\u683c\u5904\u7406\u4e0a\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u7528\u5fae\u8c03\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u5173\u952e\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

In this work, we present a comparative analysis of a custom-designed CNN and several widely used deep learning architectures, including VGG-16, ResNet-50, and MobileNet, for an image classification task. The custom CNN is developed and trained from scratch, while the popular architectures are employed using transfer learning under identical experimental settings. All models are evaluated using standard performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Experimental results show that pre-trained CNN architectures consistently outperform the custom CNN in terms of classification accuracy and convergence speed, particularly when training data is limited. However, the custom CNN demonstrates competitive performance with significantly fewer parameters and reduced computational complexity.

In front-end development, visual artifacts such as sketches, mockups and annotated creenshots are essential for conveying design intent, yet their role in multi-turn code generation remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we focus on the front-end development task and curate FronTalk, a collection of 100 multi-turn dialogues derived from real-world websites across diverse domains such as news, finance, and art. Each turn features both a textual instruction and an equivalent visual instruction, each representing the same user intent. To comprehensively evaluate model performance, we propose a novel agent-based evaluation framework leveraging a web agent to simulate users and explore the website, and thus measuring both functional correctness and user experience. Evaluation of 20 models reveals two key challenges that are under-explored systematically in the literature: (1) a significant forgetting issue where models overwrite previously implemented features, resulting in task failures, and (2) a persistent challenge in interpreting visual feedback, especially for open-source vision-language models (VLMs). We propose a strong baseline to tackle the forgetting issue with AceCoder, a method that critiques the implementation of every past instruction using an autonomous web agent. This approach significantly reduces forgetting to nearly zero and improves the performance by up to 9.3% (56.0% to 65.3%). Overall, we aim to provide a solid foundation for future research in front-end development and the general interaction dynamics of multi-turn, multi-modal code generation.

An important step in this procedure is mastoidectomy, which removes part of the mastoid region of the temporal bone to provide surgical access. Accurate mastoidectomy shape prediction from preoperative imaging improves pre-surgical planning, reduces risks, and enhances surgical outcomes. Despite its importance, there are limited deep-learning-based studies regarding this topic due to the challenges of acquiring ground-truth labels. We address this gap by investigating self-supervised and weakly-supervised learning models to predict the mastoidectomy region without human annotations. We propose a hybrid self-supervised and weakly-supervised learning framework to predict the mastoidectomy region directly from preoperative CT scans, where the mastoid remains intact. Our hybrid method achieves a mean Dice score of 0.72 when predicting the complex and boundary-less mastoidectomy shape, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches and demonstrating strong performance. The method provides groundwork for constructing 3D postmastoidectomy surfaces directly from the corresponding preoperative CT scans.

CMR scans exhibit wide variability in image contrast, sampling patterns, scanner vendors, anatomical structures, and disease types.

However, such slow-thinking approaches often lead to overthinking, where models produce excessively verbose responses even for simple queries, resulting in test-time inefficiency and even degraded accuracy. Prior work has attempted to mitigate this issue via adaptive reasoning strategies, but these methods largely overlook a fundamental bottleneck: visual perception failures. We argue that stable reasoning critically depends on low-level visual grounding, and that reasoning errors often originate from imperfect perception rather than insufficient deliberation. To address this limitation, we propose Gated Perception-Reasoning Optimization (GPRO), a meta-reasoning controller that dynamically routes computation among three decision paths at each generation step: a lightweight fast path, a slow perception path for re-examining visual inputs, and a slow reasoning path for internal self-reflection. To learn this distinction, we derive large-scale failure attribution supervision from approximately 790k samples, using teacher models to distinguish perceptual hallucinations from reasoning errors. We then train the controller with multi-objective reinforcement learning to optimize the trade-off between task accuracy and computational cost under uncertainty. Experiments on five benchmarks demonstrate that GPRO substantially improves both accuracy and efficiency, outperforming recent slow-thinking methods while generating significantly shorter responses.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper proposes GPRO to address overthinking in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) caused by visual perception errors, achieving improved accuracy and efficiency.", "motivation": "LVLMs using chain-of-thought reasoning often produce verbose responses due to overthinking, stemming from visual perception failures rather than insufficient deliberation.", "method": "GPRO introduces a meta-reasoning controller with three decision paths (fast, slow perception, slow reasoning) and uses 790k samples with reinforcement learning to balance accuracy and computational cost.", "result": "Experiments show GPRO significantly enhances both accuracy and efficiency, outperforming existing slow-thinking methods with shorter responses.", "conclusion": "Addressing visual perception failures is critical for stable LVLM reasoning; GPRO's dynamic computation routing improves system reliability and resource optimization."}}

Prevailing explainable AI techniques rely on post hoc numerical feature attributions, which fail to provide coherent narratives behind model decisions. Large language models (LLMs) present an opportunity to generate natural-language explanations, but three design challenges remain unresolved: explanations must be both decision-correct and faithful to the factors that drive the prediction; they should be able to serve multiple audiences without shifting the underlying decision rule; and they should be trained in a label-efficient way that does not depend on large corpora of human-scored explanations. To address these challenges, we introduce LEXMA (LLM-based EXplanations for Multi-Audience decisions), a reinforcement-learning-based fine-tuning framework that produces narrative-driven, audience-appropriate explanations. LEXMA combines reflection-augmented supervised fine-tuning with two stages of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Specifically, it fine-tunes two separate parameter sets to improve decision correctness and satisfy stylistic requirements for different audiences, using reward signals that do not rely on human-annotated explanations. We instantiate LEXMA in the context of mortgage approval decisions. Results demonstrate that LEXMA yields significant improvements in predictive performance compared with other LLM baselines. Moreover, human evaluations show that expert-facing explanations generated by our approach are more risk-focused, and consumer-facing explanations are clearer, more actionable, and more polite. Our study contributes a cost-efficient, systematic LLM fine-tuning approach to enhance explanation quality for business decisions, offering strong potential for scalable deployment of transparent AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faLEXMA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5fae\u8c03\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u591a\u53d7\u4f17\u9002\u914d\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u89e3\u91ca\u6027AI\u4e2d\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u591a\u53d7\u4f17\u9002\u914d\u6027\u548c\u6807\u6ce8\u6548\u7387\u6027\u4e09\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u623f\u8d37\u5ba1\u6279\u9886\u57df\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8b\u540e\u6570\u503c\u5f52\u56e0\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53d9\u4e8b\u6027\uff0c\u73b0\u6709LLM\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u672a\u89e3\u96be\u9898\uff1a\u9700\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u51b3\u7b56\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u548c\u5f52\u56e0\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u3001\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u53d7\u4f17\u9700\u6c42\u4e14\u4e0d\u6539\u53d8\u51b3\u7b56\u89c4\u5219\u3001\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f4e\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u53cd\u5c04\u589e\u5f3a\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u63d0\u5347\u51b3\u7b56\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c2\uff09\u5206\u7ec4\u76f8\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316(GRPO)\u5206\u79bb\u53c2\u6570\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u53d7\u4f17\u98ce\u683c\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u66ff\u4ee3\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u623f\u8d37\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8aLLM\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e13\u5bb6\u7aef\u89e3\u91ca\u5448\u73b0\u98ce\u63a7\u5bfc\u5411\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u7aef\u89e3\u91ca\u66f4\u6e05\u6670\u3001\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e14\u793c\u8c8c\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u53d9\u4e8b\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8d21\u732e\u4e86\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684LLM\u89e3\u91ca\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b97\u6cd5\u521b\u65b0\u6253\u7834\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u4e3a\u5546\u4e1a\u51b3\u7b56\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u900f\u660e\u5316\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5176\u591a\u53d7\u4f17\u9002\u914d\u673a\u5236\u5177\u6709\u884c\u4e1a\u5e94\u7528\u63a8\u5e7f\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Recent work has explored using vision-language models (VLMs) for planning, yet existing approaches typically treat perception, prediction, and planning as separate modules. We propose UniDrive-WM, a unified VLM-based world model that jointly performs driving-scene understanding, trajectory planning, and trajectory-conditioned future image generation within a single architecture. UniDrive-WM's trajectory planner predicts a future trajectory, which conditions a VLM-based image generator to produce plausible future frames. These predictions provide additional supervisory signals that enhance scene understanding and iteratively refine trajectory generation. We further compare discrete and continuous output representations for future image prediction, analyzing their influence on downstream driving performance. Experiments on the challenging Bench2Drive benchmark show that UniDrive-WM produces high-fidelity future images and improves planning performance by 5.9% in L2 trajectory error and 9.2% in collision rate over the previous best method. These results demonstrate the advantages of tightly integrating VLM-driven reasoning, planning, and generative world modeling for autonomous driving.

Nevertheless, the synthesized texture UV map usually comes from a space constructed by the training data or the 2D face generator, which limits the methods' generalization ability for in-the-wild input images. Consequently, their facial details, structures and identity may not be consistent with the input. In this paper, we address this issue by proposing a style transfer-based facial texture refinement method named FaceRefiner. FaceRefiner treats the 3D sampled texture as style and the output of a texture generation method as content. The photo-realistic style is then expected to be transferred from the style image to the content image. Different from current style transfer methods that only transfer high and middle level information to the result, our style transfer method integrates differentiable rendering to also transfer low level (or pixel level) information in the visible face regions. The main benefit of such multi-level information transfer is that, the details, structures and semantics in the input can thus be well preserved. The extensive experiments on Multi-PIE, CelebA and FFHQ datasets demonstrate that our refinement method can improve the texture quality and the face identity preserving ability, compared with state-of-the-arts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faFaceRefiner\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u98ce\u683c\u8fc1\u79fb\u4e0e\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u6e32\u67d3\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u9762\u90e8\u7eb9\u7406\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u6301\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u62162D\u751f\u6210\u5668\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u7eb9\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u8f93\u5165\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u7ec6\u8282\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u8eab\u4efd\u6613\u5931\u771f\u3002", "method": "\u5c063D\u91c7\u6837\u7eb9\u7406\u4f5c\u4e3a\u98ce\u683c\u6e90\uff0c\u5c06\u539f\u7eb9\u7406\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u679c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u98ce\u683c\u8fc1\u79fb\u6846\u67b6\u5e76\u96c6\u6210\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u6e32\u67d3\uff0c\u591a\u5c42\u6b21\u4f20\u9012\u4f4e\uff08\u50cf\u7d20\uff09\u3001\u4e2d\uff08\u7eb9\u7406\uff09\u3001\u9ad8\u5c42\uff08\u8bed\u4e49\uff09\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u5728Multi-PIE\u3001CelebA\u3001FFHQ\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u6307\u6807\u548c\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u6548\u679c\u5747\u4f18\u4e8eSOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u6301\u7684\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u6e32\u67d3\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u8fc1\u79fb\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u9762\u90e8\u7eb9\u7406\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u4e0e\u8eab\u4efd\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u96be\u4ee5\u517c\u987e\u7684\u77db\u76fe\u3002"}}

The final published version is available via IEEE Xplore", "summary": "Segmentation of the left atrial (LA) wall and endocardium from late gadolinium-enhanced (LGE) MRI is essential for quantifying atrial fibrosis in patients with atrial fibrillation. The development of accurate machine learning-based segmentation models remains challenging due to the limited availability of data and the complexity of anatomical structures. In this work, we investigate 3D conditional generative models as potential solution for augmenting scarce LGE training data and improving LA segmentation performance. We develop a pipeline to synthesize high-fidelity 3D LGE MRI volumes from composite semantic label maps combining anatomical expert annotations with unsupervised tissue clusters, using three 3D conditional generators (Pix2Pix GAN, SPADE-GAN, and SPADE-LDM). The synthetic images are evaluated for realism and their impact on downstream LA segmentation. SPADE-LDM generates the most realistic and structurally accurate images, achieving an FID of 4.063 and surpassing GAN models, which have FIDs of 40.821 and 7.652 for Pix2Pix and SPADE-GAN, respectively. When augmented with synthetic LGE images, the Dice score for LA cavity segmentation with a 3D U-Net model improved from 0.908 to 0.936, showing a statistically significant improvement (p < 0.05) over the baseline.These findings demonstrate the potential of label-conditioned 3D synthesis to enhance the segmentation of under-represented cardiac structures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u75283D\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771fLGE MRI\u5f71\u50cf\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u5de6\u5fc3\u623f\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u548c\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\u590d\u6742\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u5b9e\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\u3002SPADEF-LDM\u5728\u751f\u6210\u6548\u679c\uff08FID 4.063\uff09\u548c\u5206\u5272Dice\u503c\uff080.936\uff09\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfGAN\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5de6\u5fc3\u623f\uff08LA\uff09\u58c1\u548c\u5fc3\u5185\u819c\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u5206\u5272\u5bf9\u91cf\u5316\u5fc3\u623f\u98a4\u52a8\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u623f\u98a4\u7ea4\u7ef4\u5316\u7a0b\u5ea6\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u7a00\u758f\u7684LGE MRI\u6570\u636e\u548c\u590d\u6742\u7684\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u8fbe\u5230\u7406\u60f3\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "1. \u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\u4e0e\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u7ec4\u7ec7\u805a\u7c7b\u878d\u5408\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u6807\u7b7e\u56fe\uff1b2. \u4f7f\u7528Pix2Pix GAN\u3001SPADE-GAN\u548cSPADEF-LDM\u4e09\u79cd3D\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\uff1b3. \u901a\u8fc7FID\u5206\u6570\u8bc4\u4f30\u5408\u6210\u5f71\u50cf\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u6d4b\u8bd5\u589e\u5f3a\u6570\u636e\u5bf93D U-Net\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u679c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "SPADEF-LDM\u5728\u751f\u6210\u6548\u679c\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\uff08FID 4.063\uff09\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfGAN\u6a21\u578b\uff08Pix2Pix:40.821\uff0cSPADE-FAN:7.652\uff09\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u540e\uff0c\u5de6\u5fc3\u623f\u8154\u5206\u5272\u7684Dice\u8bc4\u5206\u4ece0.908\u63d0\u5347\u81f30.936\uff08p<0.05\uff09\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u663e\u8457\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u6807\u7b7e\u76843D\u5408\u6210\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u5fc3\u810f\u7ed3\u6784\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u589e\u5f3a\u7f55\u89c1\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\u8868\u5f81\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

We formalize two distinct unlearning granularities, domain-level and instance-level, and propose BiForget, an automated framework for synthesizing high-quality forget sets. Unlike prior work relying on external generators, BiForget exploits the target model per se to elicit data that matches its internal knowledge distribution through seed-guided and adversarial prompting. Our experiments across diverse benchmarks show that it achieves a superior balance of relevance, diversity, and efficiency. Quantitatively, in the Harry Potter domain, it improves relevance by ${\\sim}20$ and diversity by ${\\sim}$0.05 while halving the total data size compared to SOTAs.

Editing them from natural-language instructions requires fine-grained, layer-aware reasoning to identify relevant layers and coordinate modifications. Prior work largely overlooks multi-layer design document editing, focusing instead on single-layer image editing or multi-layer generation, which assume a flat canvas and lack the reasoning needed to determine what and where to modify. To address this gap, we introduce the Multi-Layer Document Editing Agent (MiLDEAgent), a reasoning-based framework that combines an RL-trained multimodal reasoner for layer-wise understanding with an image editor for targeted modifications. To systematically benchmark this setting, we introduce the MiLDEBench, a human-in-the-loop corpus of over 20K design documents paired with diverse editing instructions. The benchmark is complemented by a task-specific evaluation protocol, MiLDEEval, which spans four dimensions including instruction following, layout consistency, aesthetics, and text rendering. Extensive experiments on 14 open-source and 2 closed-source models reveal that existing approaches fail to generalize: open-source models often cannot complete multi-layer document editing tasks, while closed-source models suffer from format violations. In contrast, MiLDEAgent achieves strong layer-aware reasoning and precise editing, significantly outperforming all open-source baselines and attaining performance comparable to closed-source models, thereby establishing the first strong baseline for multi-layer document editing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faMiLDEAgent\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u5c42\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6587\u6863\uff08\u5982\u6d77\u62a5\uff09\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u7f16\u8f91\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408RL\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u5668\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5206\u5c42\u4fee\u6539\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u805a\u7126\u5355\u5c42\u6216\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u591a\u5c42\u5206\u5c42\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u771f\u5b9e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6587\u6863\u4e2d\u590d\u6742\u5c42\u95f4\u7684\u534f\u540c\u4fee\u6539\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaMiLDEAgent\uff1a1\uff09\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u591a\u6a21\u6001reasoner\u8fdb\u884c\u5c42\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u4fee\u6539\u51b3\u7b56\uff1b2\uff09\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u5668\u6267\u884c\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u4fee\u6539\uff1b3\uff09\u521b\u5efaMiLDEBench\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0820K\u6587\u6863+\u6307\u4ee4\uff09\u53caMiLDEEval\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\uff08\u8986\u76d6\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u3001\u5e03\u5c40\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7b494\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u591a\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b8c\u6210\u591a\u5c42\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u95ed\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u683c\u5f0f\u8fdd\u89c4\u3002MiLDEAgent\u4f18\u4e8e\u6240\u6709\u5f00\u6e90\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5728\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u3001\u5e03\u5c40\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u63a5\u8fd1\u95ed\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u9996\u4e2a\u5f3a\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "conclusion": "MiLDEAgent\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u5c42\u6587\u6863\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u7cbe\u51c6\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u63a8\u52a8\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u62d3\u5c55\u81f3\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u8bbe\u8ba1\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

We present RIGOURATE, a two-stage multimodal framework that retrieves supporting evidence from a paper's body and assigns each claim an overstatement score. The framework consists of a dataset of over 10K claim-evidence sets from ICLR and NeurIPS papers, annotated using eight LLMs, with overstatement scores calibrated using peer-review comments and validated through human evaluation.

Examples include medical monitoring and control systems, as well as autonomous cars. Such systems are intended to operate according to the protocols and guidelines for regular system operations. However, in many scenarios, such as closed-loop blood glucose control for Type 1 diabetics, self-driving cars, and monitoring systems for stroke diagnosis. The operations of such AI-enabled human-centric applications can expose them to cases for which their operational mode may be uncertain, for instance, resulting from the interactions with a human with the system. Such cases, in which the system is in uncertain conditions, can violate the system's safety and security requirements. \n  This paper will discuss operational deviations that can lead these systems to operate in unknown conditions. We will then create a framework to evaluate different strategies for ensuring the safety and security of AI-enabled human-centric cyber-physical systems in operation deployment.

However, most existing RAG strategies treat retrieved passages in a flat and unstructured way, which prevents the model from capturing structural cues and constrains its ability to synthesize knowledge from dispersed evidence across documents. To overcome these limitations, we propose Disco-RAG, a discourse-aware framework that explicitly injects discourse signals into the generation process. Our method constructs intra-chunk discourse trees to capture local hierarchies and builds inter-chunk rhetorical graphs to model cross-passage coherence.

First, we extract Euclidean features using CLIP and map them to hyperbolic space. Second, we design a dynamic-supervision entailment modeling mechanism that transforms discrete entailment logic into continuous geometric structure supervision. Finally, we propose an adaptive modulation regressor that utilizes hyperbolic geometric features to generate sample-level modulation parameters, adaptively calibrating Euclidean cosine similarity to predict the final score.

Existing video super-resolution (VSR) methods either neglect the inherent modality gap between infrared and visible images or fail to restore turbulence-induced distortions. Directly cascading turbulence mitigation (TM) algorithms with VSR methods leads to error propagation and accumulation due to the decoupled modeling of degradation between turbulence and resolution. We introduce HATIR, a Heat-Aware Diffusion for Turbulent InfraRed Video Super-Resolution, which injects heat-aware deformation priors into the diffusion sampling path to jointly model the inverse process of turbulent degradation and structural detail loss. Specifically, HATIR constructs a Phasor-Guided Flow Estimator, rooted in the physical principle that thermally active regions exhibit consistent phasor responses over time, enabling reliable turbulence-aware flow to guide the reverse diffusion process. To ensure the fidelity of structural recovery under nonuniform distortions, a Turbulence-Aware Decoder is proposed to selectively suppress unstable temporal cues and enhance edge-aware feature aggregation via turbulence gating and structure-aware attention. We built FLIR-IVSR, the first dataset for turbulent infrared VSR, comprising paired LR-HR sequences from a FLIR T1050sc camera (1024 X 768) spanning 640 diverse scenes with varying camera and object motion conditions. This encourages future research in infrared VSR.

However, how understanding can effectively assist generation has not been fully explored. Unlike previous works that focus on leveraging reasoning abilities and world knowledge from understanding models, this paper introduces a novel perspective: leveraging understanding to enhance the fidelity and detail richness of generated images. To this end, we propose Forge-and-Quench, a new unified framework that puts this principle into practice. In the generation process of our framework, an MLLM first reasons over the entire conversational context, including text instructions, to produce an enhanced text instruction. This refined instruction is then mapped to a virtual visual representation, termed the Bridge Feature, via a novel Bridge Adapter. This feature acts as a crucial link, forging insights from the understanding model to quench and refine the generation process. It is subsequently injected into the T2I backbone as a visual guidance signal, alongside the enhanced text instruction that replaces the original input. To validate this paradigm, we conduct comprehensive studies on the design of the Bridge Feature and Bridge Adapter. Our framework demonstrates exceptional extensibility and flexibility, enabling efficient migration across different MLLM and T2I models with significant savings in training overhead, all without compromising the MLLM's inherent multimodal understanding capabilities. Experiments show that Forge-and-Quench significantly improves image fidelity and detail across multiple models, while also maintaining instruction-following accuracy and enhancing world knowledge application.

Goodman"], "title": "Learning to Simulate Human Dialogue", "comment": "Kanishk Gandhi and Agam Bhatia contributed equally", "summary": "To predict what someone will say is to model how they think. We study this through next-turn dialogue prediction: given a conversation, predict the next utterance produced by a person. We compare learning approaches along two dimensions: (1) whether the model is allowed to think before responding, and (2) how learning is rewarded either through an LLM-as-a-judge that scores semantic similarity and information completeness relative to the ground-truth response, or by directly maximizing the log-probability of the true human dialogue. We find that optimizing for judge-based rewards indeed increases judge scores throughout training, however it decreases the likelihood assigned to ground truth human responses and decreases the win rate when human judges choose the most human-like response among a real and synthetic option. This failure is amplified when the model is allowed to think before answering. In contrast, by directly maximizing the log-probability of observed human responses, the model learns to better predict what people actually say, improving on both log-probability and win rate evaluations. Treating chain-of-thought as a latent variable, we derive a lower bound on the log-probability. Optimizing this objective yields the best results on all our evaluations.

However, their reliance on large-scale datasets-often collected from human or web sources-makes them vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where adversaries poison a small subset of data to implant hidden behaviors. Despite this growing risk, defenses for instruction-tuned models remain underexplored. We propose MB-Defense (Merging & Breaking Defense Framework), a novel training pipeline that immunizes instruction-tuned LLMs against diverse backdoor threats. MB-Defense comprises two stages: (i) defensive poisoning, which merges attacker and defensive triggers into a unified backdoor representation, and (ii) weight recovery, which breaks this representation through additional training to restore clean behavior. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs show that MB-Defense substantially lowers attack success rates while preserving instruction-following ability.

Recently, some methods begin to address multi-image grounding. However, they are constrained by single-target localization and limited types of practical tasks, due to the lack of unified modeling for generalized grounding tasks. Therefore, we propose GeM-VG, an MLLM capable of Generalized Multi-image Visual Grounding. To support this, we systematically categorize and organize existing multi-image grounding tasks according to their reliance of cross-image cues and reasoning, and introduce the MG-Data-240K dataset, addressing the limitations of existing datasets regarding target quantity and image relation. To tackle the challenges of robustly handling diverse multi-image grounding tasks, we further propose a hybrid reinforcement finetuning strategy that integrates chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and direct answering, considering their complementary strengths. This strategy adopts an R1-like algorithm guided by a carefully designed rule-based reward, effectively enhancing the model's overall perception and reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior generalized grounding capabilities of our model.

We propose a scalable framework for counterfactual video generation that synthesizes videos differing only in actions or temporal structure while preserving scene context.

Using this framework, we build CounterVid, a synthetic dataset of ~26k preference pairs targeting action recognition and temporal reasoning.

In this paper, we propose GRACE, a reinforcement-learning framework that simultaneously mitigates both types of flaws.

A multi-stage gated reward function is then employed to train the model to assess evidence sufficiency, extract key supporting evidence, and provide answers or explicitly abstain.

However, accurately estimating depth from 2D images continues to be a persistent and fundamental challenge in the field of 3D recovery. Heuristic approaches involve with the ill-posed problem for inferring the spatial variant defocusing blur, as the desired blur cannot be distinguished from the inherent blur. Given a prior knowledge of the defocus model, the problem become well-posed with an analytic solution for the relative blur between two images, taken at the same viewpoint with different camera settings for the focus. The Gaussian model stands out as an optimal choice for real-time applications, due to its mathematical simplicity and computational efficiency. And theoretically, it is the only model can be applied at the same time to both the absolute blur caused by depth in a single image and the relative blur resulting from depth differences between two images. This paper introduces the settings, for conventional imaging devices, to ensure that the defocusing operator adheres to the Gaussian model. Defocus analysis begins within the framework of geometric optics and is conducted by defocus aberration theory in diffraction-limited optics to obtain the accuracy of fitting the actual model to its Gaussian approximation. The results for a typical set of focused depths between $1$ and $100$ meters, with a maximum depth variation of $10\\%$ at the focused depth, confirm the Gaussian model's applicability for defocus operators in most imaging devices.

While existing watermarking methods perform well in high-resource languages, their robustness in low-resource languages remains underexplored. This work presents the first systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art text watermarking methods: KGW, Exponential Sampling (EXP), and Waterfall, for Bangla LLM text generation under cross-lingual round-trip translation (RTT) attacks. Under benign conditions, KGW and EXP achieve high detection accuracy (>88%) with negligible perplexity and ROUGE degradation. However, RTT causes detection accuracy to collapse below RTT causes detection accuracy to collapse to 9-13%, indicating a fundamental failure of token-level watermarking. To address this, we propose a layered watermarking strategy that combines embedding-time and post-generation watermarks.

Moreover, these approaches focus only on supportive neurons that correlate positively with task completion, while neglecting neurons with other roles-such as inhibitive roles-and misled neuron attribution due to fortuitous behaviors in LLMs (i.e., correctly answer the questions by chance rather than genuine understanding). To address these challenges, we propose NeuronLLM, a novel task-level LLM understanding framework that adopts the biological principle of functional antagonism for LLM neuron identification. The key insight is that task performance is jointly determined by neurons with two opposing roles: good neurons that facilitate task completion and bad neurons that inhibit it. NeuronLLM achieves a holistic modeling of neurons via contrastive learning of good and bad neurons, while leveraging augmented question sets to mitigate the fortuitous behaviors in LLMs. Comprehensive experiments on LLMs of different sizes and families show the superiority of NeuronLLM over existing methods in four NLP tasks, providing new insights into LLM functional organization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faNeuronLLM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u5bf9\u7acb\u4f5c\u7528\u673a\u5236\u89e3\u6790\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u529f\u80fd\u7ec4\u7ec7\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u5355\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6027\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u6291\u5236\u6027\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u53ca\u5076\u7136\u6027\u884c\u4e3a\u8bef\u5bfc\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u591a\u80fd\u529b\u534f\u540c\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u573a\u666f\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u7269\u62ee\u6297\u539f\u7406\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5efa\u6a21\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u826f\u6027\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u548c\u6291\u5236\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6076\u6027\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u5c55\u95ee\u9898\u96c6\u6d88\u9664\u5076\u7136\u6027\u5e72\u6270\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u7c7b\u578b\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u56db\u7c7bNLP\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5747\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u8bc6\u522b\u53cc\u5411\u4f5c\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u7c07\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9996\u6b21\u5efa\u7acb\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53cc\u5411\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u5de5\u4f5c\u673a\u5236\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Since Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) provide generic priors, several studies have explored their potential as domain-agnostic zero-shot inverse solvers. Despite these efforts, existing latent diffusion inverse solvers suffer from their instability, exhibiting undesirable artifacts and degraded quality. In this work, we first identify the instability as a discrepancy between the solver's and true reverse diffusion dynamics, and show that reducing this gap stabilizes the solver. Building on this, we introduce Measurement-Consistent Langevin Corrector (MCLC), a theoretically grounded plug-and-play correction module that remedies the LDM-based inverse solvers through measurement-consistent Langevin updates. Compared to prior approaches that rely on linear manifold assumptions, which often do not hold in latent space, MCLC operates without this assumption, leading to more stable and reliable behavior. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of MCLC and its compatibility with existing solvers across diverse image restoration tasks. Additionally, we analyze blob artifacts and offer insights into their underlying causes.

To mitigate the high cost of expert annotation, prior work has commonly relied on LLM-generated feedback to train essay assessment models. However, such feedback is often incorporated without explicit quality validation, resulting in the propagation of noise in downstream applications. To address this limitation, we propose FeedEval, an LLM-based framework for evaluating LLM-generated essay feedback along three pedagogically grounded dimensions: specificity, helpfulness, and validity. FeedEval employs dimension-specialized LLM evaluators trained on datasets curated in this study to assess multiple feedback candidates and select high-quality feedback for downstream use.

While detector-based approaches typically achieve strong frame-level accuracy, they often suffer from temporal inconsistencies caused by frequent detection dropouts.

Meanwhile, foundation models like SAMURAI have established their effectiveness across other domains, exhibiting strong category-agnostic tracking performance.

Our findings demonstrate that the proposed extension significantly improves robustness in complex urban environments, with pronounced benefits in long-duration sequences - especially under drone exit-re-entry events.

However, these methods face significant challenges when applied to multi-hop reasoning tasks requiring knowledge chaining. In this work, we study the effect of editing knowledge with ROME on different layer depths and identify three key failure modes. First, the \"hopping-too-late\" problem occurs as later layers lack access to necessary intermediate representations. Second, generalization ability deteriorates sharply when editing later layers.

However, most existing content-based video retrieval benchmarks focus on scene-level similarity and do not evaluate the action discrimination required in surveillance. To address this gap, we introduce SOVABench (Surveillance Opposite Vehicle Actions Benchmark), a real-world retrieval benchmark built from surveillance footage and centered on vehicle-related actions. SOVABench defines two evaluation protocols (inter-pair and intra-pair) to assess cross-action discrimination and temporal direction understanding. Although action distinctions are generally intuitive for human observers, our experiments show that they remain challenging for state-of-the-art vision and multimodal models.\n  Leveraging the visual reasoning and instruction-following capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), we present a training-free framework for producing interpretable embeddings from MLLM-generated descriptions for both images and videos. The framework achieves strong performance on SOVABench as well as on several spatial and counting benchmarks where contrastive Vision-Language Models often fail.

In current systems, however, description specificity is often conflated with their length. We argue that these two concepts must be disentangled: descriptions can be concise yet dense with information, or lengthy yet vacuous. We define specificity relative to a contrast set, where a description is more specific to the extent that it picks out the target image better than other possible images. We construct a dataset that controls for length while varying information content, and validate that people reliably prefer more specific descriptions regardless of length. We find that controlling for length alone cannot account for differences in specificity: how the length budget is allocated makes a difference.

In industrial settings such as pharmaceutical content understanding, practitioners must process long-form videos under strict GPU, latency, and cost constraints, where many existing approaches fail to scale. In this work, we present an industrial GenAI framework that processes over 200,000 PDFs, 25,326 videos across eight formats (e.g., MP4, M4V, etc.), and 888 multilingual audio files in more than 20 languages. Our study makes three contributions: (i) an industrial large-scale architecture for multimodal reasoning in pharmaceutical domains; (ii) empirical analysis of over 40 VLMs on two leading benchmarks (Video-MME and MMBench) and proprietary dataset of 25,326 videos across 14 disease areas; and (iii) four findings relevant to long-form video reasoning: the role of multimodality, attention mechanism trade-offs, temporal reasoning limits, and challenges of video splitting under GPU constraints. Results show 3-8 times efficiency gains with SDPA attention on commodity GPUs, multimodality improving up to 8/12 task domains (especially length-dependent tasks), and clear bottlenecks in temporal alignment and keyframe detection across open- and closed-source VLMs. Rather than proposing a new \"A+B\" model, this paper characterizes practical limits, trade-offs, and failure patterns of current VLMs under realistic deployment constraints, and provide actionable guidance for both researchers and practitioners designing scalable multimodal systems for long-form video understanding in industrial domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff08\u5982\u5236\u836f\u9886\u57df\uff09\u5904\u7406\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u65f6\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709VLMs\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u77ed\u89c6\u9891\u548c\u65e0\u8d44\u6e90\u9650\u5236\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u4f46\u5de5\u4e1a\u573a\u666f\uff08\u5982\u5236\u836f\u5185\u5bb9\u5206\u6790\uff09\u9700\u5904\u7406\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u5e76\u9762\u4e34\u4e25\u683c\u7684GPU\u3001\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u6210\u672c\u7ea6\u675f\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e0e\u7814\u7a76\u95f4\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "1. \u6784\u5efa\u5de5\u4e1a\u7ea7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5904\u7406\u8d8520\u4e07PDFs\u300125,326\u4e2a\u8de88\u79cd\u683c\u5f0f\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u4ee5\u53ca888\u4e2a\u591a\u8bed\u79cd\u97f3\u9891\u6587\u4ef6\uff1b2. \u5bf940+\u79cdVLMs\u5728Video-MME\u3001MMBench\u53ca\u81ea\u5efa\u768425k+\u75be\u75c5\u9886\u57df\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\uff1b3. \u63a2\u7a76\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4f5c\u7528\u3001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u6743\u8861\u3001\u65f6\u5e8f\u63a8\u7406\u9650\u5236\u53caGPU\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5207\u5206\u6311\u6218\u3002", "result": "\u4f7f\u7528SDPA\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u83b7\u5f973-8\u500d\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5728\u65f6\u5e8f\u4f9d\u8d56\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63d0\u53478/12\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f00\u653e/\u95ed\u6e90VLMs\u5728\u65f6\u5e8f\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0a\u7684\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u5de5\u7a0b\u7ea7\u4f18\u5316\u5efa\u8bae\uff08\u5982\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u7247\u7b56\u7565\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5de5\u4e1a\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0bVLMs\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u9650\u5236\u548c\u5931\u6548\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5bfc\uff08\u5982\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u9009\u578b\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u7b56\u7565\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

Recent advances in speech language models (SpeechLMs) have enabled more natural speech-based interaction, yet the scarcity of medical speech data and the inefficiency of directly fine-tuning on speech data jointly hinder the adoption of SpeechLMs in medical consultation. In this paper, we propose SpeechMedAssist, a SpeechLM natively capable of conducting speech-based multi-turn interactions with patients. By exploiting the architectural properties of SpeechLMs, we decouple the conventional one-stage training into a two-stage paradigm consisting of (1) Knowledge & Capability Injection via Text and (2) Modality Re-alignment with Limited Speech Data, thereby reducing the requirement for medical speech data to only 10k synthesized samples. To evaluate SpeechLMs for medical consultation scenarios, we design a benchmark comprising both single-turn question answering and multi-turn simulated interactions.

Our results show that widely used metrics, including CLIPScore, PickScore, and VQA-based scores, frequently misrank these pairs, while even LLM-as-Judge systems exhibit uneven robustness in socially grounded cases. Human evaluations consistently favour semantic correctness with larger decision margins. Motivated by these findings, we propose \\textbf{\\textsc{ProtoScore}}, a robust 7B-parameter metric that substantially reduces failure rates and suppresses misranking, while running at orders of magnitude faster than the inference time of GPT-5, approaching the robustness of much larger closed-source judges.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faProtoBias\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5f53\u524d\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u539f\u578b\u504f\u5411\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684ProtoScore\u6307\u6807\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u53ef\u80fd\u504f\u5411\u89c6\u89c9\u539f\u578b\u800c\u975e\u8bed\u4e49\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u6784\u5efa\u63a7\u5236\u5bf9\u6bd4\u57fa\u51c6\u68c0\u9a8c\u6307\u6807\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u521b\u5efa\u5305\u542b\u52a8\u7269/\u7269\u4f53/\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u7684ProtoBias\u5bf9\u6bd4\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5CLIPScore/PickScore\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u4e0eLLM-as-Judge\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u4e3b\u6d41\u6307\u6807\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u6b63\u786evs\u539f\u578b\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672c\u4e2d\u9891\u7e41\u8bef\u5224\uff0c\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4f30\u66f4\u503e\u5411\u8bed\u4e49\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u52a0\u901f\u7248ProtoScore\u3002", "conclusion": "\u539f\u578b\u504f\u5411\u662f\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u7cfb\u7edf\u7f3a\u9677\uff0cProtoScore\u5728\u4fdd\u6301GPT-5\u7ea7\u522b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u8d28\u7684\u98de\u8dc3\u3002"}}

ToolGate maintains an explicit symbolic state space as a typed key-value mapping representing trusted world information throughout the reasoning process. Each tool is formalized as a Hoare-style contract consisting of a precondition and a postcondition, where the precondition gates tool invocation by checking whether the current state satisfies the required conditions, and the postcondition determines whether the tool's result can be committed to update the state through runtime verification. Our approach guarantees that the symbolic state evolves only through verified tool executions, preventing invalid or hallucinated results from corrupting the world representation.

Conventional 3D methods detect lanes from dense birds-eye-viewed (BEV) features, though erroneous transformations often result in a poor feature representation misaligned with the true 3D road surface. While recent sparse lane detectors have surpassed dense BEV approaches, they completely disregard valuable lane-specific priors. Furthermore, existing methods fail to utilize historic lane observations, which yield the potential to resolve ambiguities in situations of poor visibility. To address these challenges, we present SparseLaneSTP, a novel method that integrates both geometric properties of the lane structure and temporal information into a sparse lane transformer. It introduces a new lane-specific spatio-temporal attention mechanism, a continuous lane representation tailored for sparse architectures as well as temporal regularization. Identifying weaknesses of existing 3D lane datasets, we also introduce a precise and consistent 3D lane dataset using a simple yet effective auto-labeling strategy.

To overcome multi-view inconsistencies caused by underwater optical degradation, our method enforces trinocular view consistency by rendering horizontally and vertically translated camera views relative to each input view and aligning them via inverse warping. Furthermore, these translated camera views are used to derive a synthetic epipolar depth prior through triangulation, which serves as a self-supervised depth regularizer. These geometric constraints facilitate the spatial optimization of 3D Gaussians and preserve scene structure in underwater environments. We also propose a depth-aware alpha adjustment that modulates the opacity of 3D Gaussians during early training based on their $z$-component and viewing direction, deterring the formation of medium-induced primitives. With our contributions, 3D Gaussians are disentangled from the scattering medium, enabling robust representation of object geometry and significantly reducing floating artifacts in reconstructed underwater scenes.

This idiom describes the enduring circular training of adversarial attack patterns and adversarial training the best. The following work investigates the impact of higher-order adversarial attacks on object detectors by successively training attack patterns and hardening object detectors with adversarial training. The YOLOv10 object detector is chosen as a representative, and adversarial patches are used in an evasion attack manner. Our results indicate that higher-order adversarial patches are not only affecting the object detector directly trained on but rather provide a stronger generalization capacity compared to lower-order adversarial patches. Moreover, the results highlight that solely adversarial training is not sufficient to harden an object detector efficiently against this kind of adversarial attack.

Such a representation can be learned efficiently in a supervised fashion from both analytic functions and real data. Once learned, it can be generalized to various types of surfaces. Using PolyFit, the surfaces can be efficiently deformed by updating a compact set of jet coefficients rather than optimizing per-vertex degrees of freedom for many downstream tasks in computer vision and graphics. We demonstrate the capabilities of our proposed methodologies with two applications: 1) Shape-from-template (SfT): where the goal is to deform the input 3D template of an object as seen in image/video. Using PolyFit, we adopt test-time optimization that delivers competitive accuracy while being markedly faster than offline physics-based solvers, and outperforms recent physics-guided neural simulators in accuracy at modest additional runtime. 2) Garment draping.

Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization alleviates this issue by estimating gradients through forward passes and Gaussian sampling, avoiding the need for backpropagation. However, conventional ZO methods suffer from high variance in gradient estimation due to their reliance on random perturbations, leading to slow convergence and suboptimal performance. We propose a simple plug-and-play method that incorporates prior-informed perturbations to refine gradient estimation. Our method dynamically computes a guiding vector from Gaussian samples, which directs perturbations toward more informative directions, significantly accelerating convergence compared to standard ZO approaches. We further investigate a greedy perturbation strategy to explore the impact of prior knowledge on gradient estimation. Theoretically, we prove that our gradient estimator achieves stronger alignment with the true gradient direction, enhancing optimization efficiency. Extensive experiments across LLMs of varying scales and architectures demonstrate that our proposed method could seamlessly integrate into existing optimization methods, delivering faster convergence and superior performance.

The sheer volume of long video and audio data further exacerbates these challenges, (e.g. long clinical trial interviews and educational seminars).\n  Here, we introduce a domain adapted Video to Video Clip Generation framework that integrates Audio Language Models (ALMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) to produce highlight clips.

While hallucination detection has recently emerged as a priority in English-centric benchmarks, low-to-medium resource languages such as Vietnamese remain inadequately covered by standardized evaluation frameworks. This paper introduces the DSC2025 ViHallu Challenge, the first large-scale shared task for detecting hallucinations in Vietnamese LLMs. We present the ViHallu dataset, comprising 10,000 annotated triplets of (context, prompt, response) samples systematically partitioned into three hallucination categories: no hallucination, intrinsic, and extrinsic hallucinations. The dataset incorporates three prompt types--factual, noisy, and adversarial--to stress-test model robustness.

In this work we tackle this bottleneck by leveraging temporal-geometric consistency across LiDAR sweeps to lift and fuse cues from text and 2D vision foundation models directly into 3D, without any manual input. We introduce an unsupervised multi-modal pseudo-labeling method relying on strong geometric priors learned from temporally accumulated LiDAR maps, alongside with a novel iterative update rule that enforces joint geometric-semantic consistency, and vice-versa detecting moving objects from inconsistencies. Our method simultaneously produces 3D semantic labels, 3D bounding boxes, and dense LiDAR scans, demonstrating robust generalization across three datasets. We experimentally validate that our method compares favorably to existing semantic segmentation and object detection pseudo-labeling methods, which often require additional manual supervision.

Existing works encode cameras as Pl\u00fccker ray maps, which tie predictions to the arbitrary world coordinate gauge and make them sensitive to small camera transformations, thereby undermining geometric consistency. In this paper, we ask what inputs best condition a model for robust and consistent view synthesis. We propose projective conditioning, which replaces raw camera parameters with a target-view projective cue that provides a stable 2D input. This reframes the task from a brittle geometric regression problem in ray space to a well-conditioned target-view image-to-image translation problem.

Yet their reliability is typically assessed using benchmarks that rely on third-party annotators rather than the individuals experiencing the emotions themselves, potentially concealing systematic biases. In this paper, we use a unique, large-scale dataset of more than one million self-annotated posts and a pre-registered research design to investigate gender biases in emotion detection across 414 combinations of models and emotion-related classes. We find that across different types of automatic classifiers and various underlying emotions, error rates are consistently higher for texts authored by men compared to those authored by women. We quantify how this bias could affect results in downstream applications and show that current machine learning tools, including large language models, should be applied with caution when the gender composition of a sample is not known or variable.

However, their safety vulnerabilities become pronounced in multi-turn multi-modal scenarios, where harmful intent can be gradually reconstructed across turns, and security protocols fade into oblivion as the conversation progresses. Existing Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) alignment methods are largely developed for single-turn visual question-answer (VQA) task and often require costly manual preference annotations, limiting their effectiveness and scalability in dialogues. To address this challenge, we present InterSafe-V, an open-source multi-modal dialogue dataset containing 11,270 dialogues and 500 specially designed refusal VQA samples. This dataset, constructed through interaction between several models, is designed to more accurately reflect real-world scenarios and includes specialized VQA pairs tailored for specific domains. Building on this dataset, we propose AM$^3$Safety, a framework that combines a cold-start refusal phase with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) fine-tuning using turn-aware dual-objective rewards across entire dialogues.

Domain-specific datasets of harmful prompts remain scarce and still largely rely on manual construction; public datasets mainly focus on explicit harmful prompts, which modern LLM defenses can often detect and refuse. In contrast, implicit harmful prompts-expressed through indirect domain knowledge-are harder to detect and better reflect real-world threats. We identify two challenges: transforming domain knowledge into actionable constraints and increasing the implicitness of generated harmful prompts. To address them, we propose an end-to-end framework that first performs knowledge-graph-guided harmful prompt generation to systematically produce domain-relevant prompts, and then applies dual-path obfuscation rewriting to convert explicit harmful prompts into implicit variants via direct and context-enhanced rewriting. This framework yields high-quality datasets combining strong domain relevance with implicitness, enabling more realistic red-teaming and advancing LLM safety research.

To bridge this gap, we introduce VerseCrafter, a 4D-aware video world model that enables explicit and coherent control over both camera and object dynamics within a unified 4D geometric world state. Our approach is centered on a novel 4D Geometric Control representation, which encodes the world state through a static background point cloud and per-object 3D Gaussian trajectories. This representation captures not only an object's path but also its probabilistic 3D occupancy over time, offering a flexible, category-agnostic alternative to rigid bounding boxes or parametric models. These 4D controls are rendered into conditioning signals for a pretrained video diffusion model, enabling the generation of high-fidelity, view-consistent videos that precisely adhere to the specified dynamics. Unfortunately, another major challenge lies in the scarcity of large-scale training data with explicit 4D annotations. We address this by developing an automatic data engine that extracts the required 4D controls from in-the-wild videos, allowing us to train our model on a massive and diverse dataset.", "AI": {"tldr": "VerseCrafter\u662f\u7528\u4e8e\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u76844D\u611f\u77e5\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u7528\u6237\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u63a7\u5236\u76f8\u673a\u548c\u5bf9\u8c61\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u3001\u89c6\u89d2\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u3002\u5176\u6838\u5fc3\u521b\u65b0\u662f4D\u51e0\u4f55\u63a7\u5236\u8868\u793a\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9759\u6001\u80cc\u666f\u70b9\u4e91\u548c\u9010\u5bf9\u8c61\u76843D\u9ad8\u65af\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u5f15\u64ce\u4ece\u91ce\u751f\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d64D\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u76f8\u673a\u548c\u591a\u5bf9\u8c61\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u4e14\u4f20\u7edf2D\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5efa\u6a21\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u73b0\u5b9e\u9700\u6c42\u3002\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u9700\u8981\u7cbe\u786e\u52a8\u6001\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u800c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6807\u6ce84D\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u7f3a\u5931\u52a0\u5267\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "1) \u63d0\u51fa4D Geometric Control\u8868\u793a\u6cd5\uff1a\u9759\u6001\u80cc\u666f\u70b9\u4e91+\u5bf9\u8c61\u7ea73D\u9ad8\u65af\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u6355\u83b7\u5bf9\u8c61\u8def\u5f84\u548c\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u53d8\u76843D\u6982\u7387\u5360\u4f4d\uff1b2) \u5c064D\u63a7\u5236\u6e32\u67d3\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\u4fe1\u53f7\u8f93\u5165\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff1b3) \u5f00\u53d1\u52a8\u6001\u5f15\u64ce\uff0c\u4ece\u65e0\u6807\u6ce8\u771f\u5b9e\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u81ea\u52a8\u63d0\u53d64D\u63a7\u5236\u53c2\u6570\u5b9e\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u76f8\u673a\u548c\u5bf9\u8c61\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u663e\u5f0f\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u9891\u5177\u6709\uff1a- \u9ad8\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff08512x512\uff09- \u8de8\u89c6\u89d2\u4e00\u81f4\u6027 - \u7b26\u5408\u6307\u5b9a\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u8fd0\u52a8\u8f68\u8ff9 - \u591a\u6837\u5316\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5728\u65e0\u6807\u6ce8\u89c6\u9891\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e864D\u51e0\u4f55\u5efa\u6a21\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u5185\u5bb9\u521b\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002\u6570\u636e\u5f15\u64ce\u65b9\u6848\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u8986\u76d6\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u63a2\u7d22\u7269\u7406\u89c4\u5219\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u5f15\u5165\u3002"}}

While large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in patent and legal practice, their use has remained limited to lightweight tasks, with no established means of systematically evaluating their capacity for structured legal reasoning in the patent domain. In this work, we introduce PILOT-Bench, the first PTAB-centric benchmark that aligns PTAB decisions with USPTO patent data at the case-level and formalizes three IRAC-aligned classification tasks: Issue Type, Board Authorities, and Subdecision. We evaluate a diverse set of closed-source (commercial) and open-source LLMs and conduct analyses across multiple perspectives, including input-variation settings, model families, and error tendencies.

Speculative Decoding offers a promising avenue for acceleration, but existing approaches are limited by token-level ambiguity and lack of spatial awareness. In this work, we introduce Multi-Scale Local Speculative Decoding (MuLo-SD), a novel framework that combines multi-resolution drafting with spatially informed verification to accelerate AR image generation. Our method leverages a low-resolution drafter paired with learned up-samplers to propose candidate image tokens, which are then verified in parallel by a high-resolution target model. Crucially, we incorporate a local rejection and resampling mechanism, enabling efficient correction of draft errors by focusing on spatial neighborhoods rather than raster-scan resampling after the first rejection. We demonstrate that MuLo-SD achieves substantial speedups - up to $\\mathbf{1.7\\times}$ - outperforming strong speculative decoding baselines such as EAGLE-2 and LANTERN in terms of acceleration, while maintaining comparable semantic alignment and perceptual quality. These results are validated using GenEval, DPG-Bench, and FID/HPSv2 on the MS-COCO 5k validation split. Extensive ablations highlight the impact of up-sampling design, probability pooling, and local rejection and resampling with neighborhood expansion.

In this work, we revisit this paradigm from first principles, revealing that the ``criticality'' scores learned via costly supervision are intrinsically encoded in the draft-target distributional divergence.

Across video QA and grounding benchmarks, VideoAuto-R1 achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with significantly improved efficiency, reducing the average response length by ~3.3x, e.g., from 149 to just 44 tokens.

At low object counts, models often correct the overestimation, but as the number of objects increases, they increasingly conform to the prompt regardless of the discrepancy. Through mechanistic analysis of three VLMs, we identify a small set of attention heads whose ablation substantially reduces prompt-induced hallucinations (PIH) by at least 40% without additional training.

Rather than sampling tokens, the model evolves continuous token representations through a deterministic dynamical process, committing to a discrete token only when the representation has sufficiently converged. Discrete text is recovered via hard decoding, while uncertainty is maintained and resolved in the continuous space.\n  We show that this maturation process alone is sufficient to produce coherent and diverse text using deterministic decoding (argmax), without reliance on token-level sampling, diffusion-style denoising, or auxiliary stabilization mechanisms. Additional perturbations, such as stochastic dynamics or history smoothing, can be incorporated naturally but are not required for the model to function.\n  To our knowledge, this is the first autoregressive language model that generates text by evolving continuous token representations to convergence prior to discretization, enabling stable generation without token-level sampling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fde\u7eed\u5411\u91cf\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u4e4b\u524d\u901a\u8fc7\u8fde\u7eed\u7a7a\u95f4\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6f14\u5316\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u79bb\u6563token\u51b3\u7b56\u5bfc\u81f4\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u548c\u5bf9\u89e3\u7801\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7d22\u66f4\u5e73\u6ed1\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5904\u7406\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5c06token\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u8fde\u7eed\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6b65\u9aa4\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u8868\u5f81\u6536\u655b\u540e\u518d\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u4e3a\u5177\u4f53token\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u786c\u89e3\u7801\u7b56\u7565\u7ef4\u6301\u751f\u6210\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u548c\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5904\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u786e\u5b9a\u6027argmax\u89e3\u7801\u5373\u53ef\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u91c7\u6837\u6216\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7b49\u8f85\u52a9\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e73\u6ed1\u6f14\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u53ef\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u63a7\u751f\u6210\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u8fde\u7eed\u5316\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u751f\u6210\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6f14\u5316\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edftoken\u7ea7\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6587\u672c\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u3002"}}

One key application is Brain Age Prediction (BAP), which estimates an individual's biological brain age from MRI data. Effective BAP models require large, diverse, and age-balanced datasets, whereas existing 3D MRI datasets are demographically skewed, limiting fairness and generalizability. Acquiring new data is costly and ethically constrained, motivating generative data augmentation. Current generative methods are often based on latent diffusion models, which operate in learned low dimensional latent spaces to address the memory demands of volumetric MRI data. However, these methods are typically slow at inference, may introduce artifacts due to latent compression, and are rarely conditioned on age, thereby affecting the BAP performance. In this work, we propose FlowLet, a conditional generative framework that synthesizes age-conditioned 3D MRIs by leveraging flow matching within an invertible 3D wavelet domain, helping to avoid reconstruction artifacts and reducing computational demands. Experiments show that FlowLet generates high-fidelity volumes with few sampling steps. Training BAP models with data generated by FlowLet improves performance for underrepresented age groups, and region-based analysis confirms preservation of anatomical structures.", "AI": {"tldr": "FlowLet\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u53ef\u90063D\u5c0f\u6ce2\u57df\u4e2d\u5408\u6210\u5e74\u9f84\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u76843D MRI\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5185\u5b58\u9700\u6c42\u3001\u751f\u6210\u901f\u5ea6\u53ca\u5e74\u9f84\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u8111\u9f84\u9884\u6d4b\uff08BAP\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u8981\u5927\u578b\u4e14\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u67093D MRI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b58\u5728\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u800c\u4f20\u7edf\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u6162\u3001\u538b\u7f29\u4f2a\u5f71\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5e74\u9f84\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86BAP\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "FlowLet\u5229\u7528\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728\u53ef\u90063D\u5c0f\u6ce2\u57df\u4e2d\u76f4\u63a5\u5408\u6210\u5e74\u9f84\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u7684MRI\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u538b\u7f29\u4f2a\u5f71\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u964d\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFlowLet\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771fMRI\u4f53\u79ef\u6570\u636e\u4ec5\u9700\u5c11\u91cf\u91c7\u6837\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684BAP\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u5e74\u9f84\u6bb5\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e14\u533a\u57df\u5206\u6790\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\u4fdd\u7559\u3002", "conclusion": "FlowLet\u901a\u8fc7\u5e74\u9f84\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u7684\u751f\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u5c0f\u6ce2\u57df\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86BAP\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0e\u4f2a\u5f71\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

These simplifications also limit interpretability: global explanations cannot identify which specific segments are misleading or differentiate how a detail is false (e.g., distorted vs. fabricated). To address these gaps, we introduce MisSpans, the first multi-domain, human-annotated benchmark for span-level misinformation detection and analysis, consisting of paired real and fake news stories. MisSpans defines three complementary tasks: MisSpansIdentity for pinpointing false spans within sentences, MisSpansType for categorising false spans by misinformation type, and MisSpansExplanation for providing rationales grounded in identified spans. Together, these tasks enable fine-grained localisation, nuanced characterisation beyond true/false and actionable explanations. Expert annotators were guided by standardised guidelines and consistency checks, leading to high inter-annotator agreement. We evaluate 15 representative LLMs, including reasoning-enhanced and non-reasoning variants, under zero-shot and one-shot settings. Results reveal the challenging nature of fine-grained misinformation identification and analysis, and highlight the need for a deeper understanding of how performance may be influenced by multiple interacting factors, including model size and reasoning capabilities, along with domain-specific textual features.

We aim to endow computational systems with a similar ability to predict plausible future object motions directly from passive visual observation. We introduce ObjectForesight, a 3D object-centric dynamics model that predicts future 6-DoF poses and trajectories of rigid objects from short egocentric video sequences. Unlike conventional world or dynamics models that operate in pixel or latent space, ObjectForesight represents the world explicitly in 3D at the object level, enabling geometrically grounded and temporally coherent predictions that capture object affordances and trajectories. To train such a model at scale, we leverage recent advances in segmentation, mesh reconstruction, and 3D pose estimation to curate a dataset of 2 million plus short clips with pseudo-ground-truth 3D object trajectories. Through extensive experiments, we show that ObjectForesight achieves significant gains in accuracy, geometric consistency, and generalization to unseen objects and scenes, establishing a scalable framework for learning physically grounded, object-centric dynamics models directly from observation. objectforesight.github.io", "AI": {"tldr": "ObjectForesight\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e3D\u7269\u4f53\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u4ece\u77ed\u89c6\u57df\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u9884\u6d4b\u7269\u4f53\u672a\u67656\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u4f4d\u59ff\u4e0e\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f3D\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u8de8\u573a\u666f\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u50cf\u7d20\u6216\u6f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u64cd\u4f5c\u5bfc\u81f4\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u65f6\u95f4\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u4eba\u7c7b\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u4e92\u8f7b\u677e\u9884\u5224\u7269\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u8d4b\u4e88\u8ba1\u7b97\u7cfb\u7edf\u7c7b\u4f3c\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u88ab\u52a8\u89c2\u5bdf\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u663e\u5f0f3D\u7269\u4f53\u7ea7\u8868\u5f81\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u5272\u3001\u7f51\u683c\u91cd\u5efa\u548c3D\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u6280\u672f\u6784\u5efa\u8d85200\u4e07\u6837\u672c\u7684\u4f2a\u771f\u5b9e\u8f68\u8ff9\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u51e0\u4f55\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u76846-DoF\u8fd0\u52a8\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u8de8\u7269\u4f53/\u573a\u666f\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u7269\u7406\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u3001\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u89c2\u5bdf\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u76843D\u7269\u4f53\u4e2d\u5fc3\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u7406\u89e3\u7269\u4f53\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e0e\u8fd0\u52a8\u8f68\u8ff9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Conversely, initial strategies that interleave retrieval with reasoning often lack global corpus awareness, while Knowledge Graph (KG)-based RAG performs strongly on complex multi-hop tasks but suffers on fact-oriented single-hop queries. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel RAG framework: ToPG (Traversal over Proposition Graphs). ToPG models its knowledge base as a heterogeneous graph of propositions, entities, and passages, effectively combining the granular fact density of propositions with graph connectivity. We leverage this structure using iterative Suggestion-Selection cycles, where the Suggestion phase enables a query-aware traversal of the graph, and the Selection phase provides LLM feedback to prune irrelevant propositions and seed the next iteration. Evaluated on three distinct QA tasks (Simple, Complex, and Abstract QA), ToPG demonstrates strong performance across both accuracy- and quality-based metrics. Overall, ToPG shows that query-aware graph traversal combined with factual granularity is a critical component for efficient structured RAG systems.

Existing methods either rely on limited human-annotated corpora, or synthesize datasets directly by simply prompting LLMs without explicit control over SQL structures, often resulting in limited structural diversity and complexity. To address this, we introduce EvolSQL, a structure-aware data synthesis framework that evolves SQL queries from seed data into richer and more semantically diverse forms. EvolSQL starts with an exploratory Query-SQL expansion to broaden question diversity and improve schema coverage, and then applies an adaptive directional evolution strategy using six atomic transformation operators derived from the SQL Abstract Syntax Tree to progressively increase query complexity across relational, predicate, aggregation, and nesting dimensions. An execution-grounded SQL refinement module and schema-aware deduplication further ensure the creation of high-quality, structurally diverse mapping pairs. Experimental results show that a 7B model fine-tuned on our data outperforms one trained on the much larger SynSQL dataset using only 1/18 of the data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51faEvolSQL\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5230SQL\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9010\u6b65\u6f14\u5316SQL\u67e5\u8be2\u63d0\u5347\u6570\u636e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u672c\u5230SQL\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u63a7\u5236\u4e0d\u8db3\u3001\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6709\u9650\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528Query-SQL\u6269\u5c55\u7b56\u7565\u6269\u5927\u95ee\u9898\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba16\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eSQL\u8bed\u6cd5\u6811\u7684\u539f\u5b50\u64cd\u4f5c\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u52a0\u5165\u6267\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u53bb\u91cd\u6a21\u5757\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u4e8eEvolSQL\u6570\u636e\u5fae\u8c03\u76847B\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528SynSQL 1/18\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u65f6\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u8d85\u8d8a\u540e\u8005\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6570\u636e\u4f7f\u7528\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742SQL\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

However, due to hardware and physical setup constraints, collecting large-scale real-world manipulation data remains difficult to scale across diverse environments. Recent work uses text-prompt conditioned image diffusion models to augment manipulation data by altering the backgrounds and tabletop objects in the visual observations. However, these approaches often overlook the practical need for multi-view and temporally coherent observations required by state-of-the-art policy models. Further, text prompts alone cannot reliably specify the scene setup. To provide the diffusion model with explicit visual guidance, we introduce visual identity prompting, which supplies exemplar images as conditioning inputs to guide the generation of the desired scene setup.

This greatly limits the real applications of REx (RES/REC/REG). This paper introduces three new benchmarks called Generalized Referring Expression Segmentation (GRES), Comprehension (GREC), and Generation (GREG), collectively denoted as GREx, which extend the classic REx to allow expressions to identify an arbitrary number of objects.

GREx and gRefCOCO are designed to be backward-compatible with REx, facilitating extensive experiments to study the performance gap of the existing REx methods on GREx tasks. One of the challenges of GRES/GREC is complex relationship modeling, for which we propose a baseline ReLA that adaptively divides the image into regions with sub-instance clues and explicitly models the region-region and region-language dependencies.

However, existing geometry foundation models still suffer severely from flying pixels and the loss of fine details. In this paper, we present pixel-perfect visual geometry models that can predict high-quality, flying-pixel-free point clouds by leveraging generative modeling in the pixel space. We first introduce Pixel-Perfect Depth (PPD), a monocular depth foundation model built upon pixel-space diffusion transformers (DiT). To address the high computational complexity associated with pixel-space diffusion, we propose two key designs: 1) Semantics-Prompted DiT, which incorporates semantic representations from vision foundation models to prompt the diffusion process, preserving global semantics while enhancing fine-grained visual details; and 2) Cascade DiT architecture that progressively increases the number of image tokens, improving both efficiency and accuracy. To further extend PPD to video (PPVD), we introduce a new Semantics-Consistent DiT, which extracts temporally consistent semantics from a multi-view geometry foundation model. We then perform reference-guided token propagation within the DiT to maintain temporal coherence with minimal computational and memory overhead. Our models achieve the best performance among all generative monocular and video depth estimation models and produce significantly cleaner point clouds than all other models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u7cbe\u786e\u89c6\u89c9\u51e0\u4f55\u6a21\u578b\uff08PPD/PPVD\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u50cf\u7d20\u7a7a\u95f4\u5185\u4f7f\u7528\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u57fa\u4e8eDiT\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff09\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u51e0\u4f55\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u98de\u50cf\u7d20\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u7ec6\u8282\u4e22\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u5355\u76ee\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u51e0\u4f55\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4ece\u5355\u76ee\u56fe\u50cf\u6062\u590d\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u98de\u50cf\u7d20\uff08flying pixels\uff09\u548c\u4e22\u5931\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7ec6\u8282\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u73b0\u5b9e\u5e94\u7528\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u50cf\u7d20\u7a7a\u95f4\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff08DiT\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u51faPPD\u5355\u76ee\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u53caPPVD\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u5c55\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5176\u6838\u5fc3\u521b\u65b0\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1) \u8bed\u4e49\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684DiT\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u793a\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u7ec6\u8282\uff1b2) \u7ea7\u8054DiT\u67b6\u6784\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u589e\u52a0\u56fe\u50cftoken\u6570\u91cf\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\uff1b3) \u89c6\u9891\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027DiT\u548c\u53c2\u8003\u5f15\u5bfctoken\u4f20\u64ad\u6280\u672f\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6240\u6709\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u5355\u76ee\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u70b9\u4e91\u5728\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u6709\u6548\u6d88\u9664\u98de\u50cf\u7d20\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u50cf\u7d20\u7a7a\u95f4\u6269\u6563\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u5f15\u5bfc\u548c\u7ea7\u8054\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u4e3a\u51e0\u4f55\u91cd\u5efa\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u5c11\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u548cAR\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

This limits the faithfulness of generated summaries in opinion-heavy settings. We introduce a disagreement-aware synthesis pipeline that separates belief-level aggregation from language generation. Documents are first represented as structured belief sets and aggregated using distance-based belief merging operators that explicitly model conflict. Large language models are then used only to realise the aggregated beliefs as natural language summaries. We evaluate the approach across multiple model families and scales, comparing it to methods that perform explicit aggregation during generation. Our results show that while sufficiently large models can match belief-level aggregation when aggregation is handled at generation time, this behaviour is not stable across architectures or capacities. In contrast, belief-level aggregation combined with simple prompting yields consistently strong disagreement-aware performance across models, while maintaining fluent and grounded summaries.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u51b2\u7a81\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6c47\u603b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u79bb\u4fe1\u5ff5\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u805a\u5408\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4fe1\u5ff5\u96c6\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u4fe1\u5ff5\u5408\u5e76\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u73b0\u6709LLM\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e73\u6ed1\u5206\u6b67\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u89c2\u70b9\u603b\u7ed3\u65f6\u9690\u5f0f\u5e73\u6ed1\u5206\u6b67\uff0c\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4ee3\u8868\u591a\u6570\u89c2\u70b9\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u610f\u89c1\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5206\u6b67\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6458\u8981\u5931\u771f\u3002", "method": "1) \u5c06\u6587\u6863\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4fe1\u5ff5\u96c6 2) \u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u4fe1\u5ff5\u5408\u5e76\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u51b2\u7a81\u8fdb\u884c\u805a\u5408 3) \u7528LLM\u5c06\u805a\u5408\u540e\u7684\u4fe1\u5ff5\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6458\u8981\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u8fdb\u884c\u805a\u5408\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u4fe1\u5ff5\u5c42\u805a\u5408\u6548\u679c\u4f46\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u800c\u63d0\u6848\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5747\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u6458\u8981\u6d41\u7545\u6027\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5206\u79bb\u805a\u5408\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u51b2\u7a81\u5efa\u6a21\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u5fe0\u5b9e\u7684\u89c2\u70b9\u603b\u7ed3\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7b80\u5355\u63d0\u793a\u5373\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u7a33\u5b9a\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

However, there is growing concern that these models rely excessively on linguistic shortcuts rather than genuine visual grounding, a phenomenon we term Text Bias. In this paper, we investigate the fundamental tension between visual perception and linguistic priors. We decouple the sources of this bias into two dimensions: Internal Corpus Bias, stemming from statistical correlations in pretraining, and External Instruction Bias, arising from the alignment-induced tendency toward sycophancy. To quantify this effect, we introduce V-FAT (Visual Fidelity Against Text-bias), a diagnostic benchmark comprising 4,026 VQA instances across six semantic domains.

Meanwhile, novel-view synthesis has seen major advances with Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), where models learn a compact representation from 2D images to render 3D scenes, albeit at the cost of larger models and intensive training. In this work, we extend the approach of QVFs by introducing QNeRF, the first hybrid quantum-classical model designed for novel-view synthesis from 2D images. QNeRF leverages parameterised quantum circuits to encode spatial and view-dependent information via quantum superposition and entanglement, resulting in more compact models compared to the classical counterpart. We present two architectural variants. Full QNeRF maximally exploits all quantum amplitudes to enhance representational capabilities. In contrast, Dual-Branch QNeRF introduces a task-informed inductive bias by branching spatial and view-dependent quantum state preparations, drastically reducing the complexity of this operation and ensuring scalability and potential hardware compatibility. Our experiments demonstrate that -- when trained on images of moderate resolution -- QNeRF matches or outperforms classical NeRF baselines while using less than half the number of parameters. These results suggest that quantum machine learning can serve as a competitive alternative for continuous signal representation in mid-level tasks in computer vision, such as 3D representation learning from 2D observations.", "AI": {"tldr": "QNeRF, a hybrid quantum-classical model leveraging quantum circuits, achieves compact and efficient 3D scene representation from 2D images, outperforming classical NeRFs with fewer parameters.", "motivation": "Classical NeRFs require large models and intensive training for novel-view synthesis.

This leads us to our central question: Is LLM-generated persuasion more difficult to automatically detect than human-written persuasion? To address this, we categorize controllable generation approaches for producing persuasive content with LLMs and introduce Persuaficial, a high-quality multilingual benchmark covering six languages: English, German, Polish, Italian, French and Russian. Using this benchmark, we conduct extensive empirical evaluations comparing human-authored and LLM-generated persuasive texts. We find that although overtly persuasive LLM-generated texts can be easier to detect than human-written ones, subtle LLM-generated persuasion consistently degrades automatic detection performance.

Existing methods are typically coarse-grained and fail to distinguish between direct quotes and complex reasoning. In this paper, we introduce Generation-time Fine-grained Provenance, a task where models must generate fluent answers while simultaneously producing structured, sentence-level provenance triples. To enable this, we present ReFInE (Relation-aware Fine-grained Interpretability & Evidence), a dataset featuring expert verified annotations that distinguish between Quotation, Compression, and Inference. Building on ReFInE, we propose GenProve, a framework that combines Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). By optimizing a composite reward for answer fidelity and provenance correctness, GenProve significantly outperforms 14 strong LLMs in joint evaluation. Crucially, our analysis uncovers a reasoning gap where models excel at surface-level quotation but struggle significantly with inference-based provenance, suggesting that verifiable reasoning remains a frontier challenge distinct from surface-level citation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6765\u6e90\u8ffd\u8e2a\u89e3\u51b3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u5efaReFInE\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548cGenProve\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7b54\u6848\u6d41\u7545\u6027\u4e0e\u6765\u6e90\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u7684\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u732e\u5f15\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u76f4\u63a5\u5f15\u7528\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7528\u6237\u96be\u4ee5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u4e0e\u6765\u6e90\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u5173\u8054\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b\u5f15\u7528\u3001\u538b\u7f29\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u4e09\u79cd\u6807\u6ce8\u7684ReFInE\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u7ed3\u5408\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u7ec4\u76f8\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u7684GenProve\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u8054\u5408\u5956\u52b1\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "GenProve\u572814\u4e2a\u4e3b\u6d41\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7b54\u6848\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6765\u6e90\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u578b\u6765\u6e90\u8ffd\u8e2a\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ec5\u4e3a\u5f15\u7528\u578b\u768440%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6765\u6e90\u8ffd\u8e2a\u63ed\u793a\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u63a8\u7406\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u80fd\u529b\u65ad\u5c42\uff0c\u8868\u9762\u5f15\u7528\u4f18\u5316\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u6df1\u5c42\u63a8\u7406\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u53ef\u5ba1\u8ba1AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Standard practices typically only retain trajectories with correct final answers (positives) while ignoring the rest (negatives). We argue that this paradigm discards substantial supervision and exacerbates overfitting, limiting out-of-domain (OOD) generalization. Specifically, we surprisingly find that incorporating negative trajectories into SFT yields substantial OOD generalization gains over positive-only training, as these trajectories often retain valid intermediate reasoning despite incorrect final answers. To understand this effect in depth, we systematically analyze data, training dynamics, and inference behavior, identifying 22 recurring patterns in negative chains that serve a dual role: they moderate loss descent to mitigate overfitting during training and boost policy entropy by 35.67% during inference to facilitate exploration. Motivated by these observations, we further propose Gain-based LOss Weighting (GLOW), an adaptive, sample-aware scheme that exploits such distinctive training dynamics by rescaling per-sample loss based on inter-epoch progress. Empirically, GLOW efficiently leverages unfiltered trajectories, yielding a 5.51% OOD gain over positive-only SFT on Qwen2.5-7B and boosting MMLU from 72.82% to 76.47% as an RL initialization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u5305\u542b\u9519\u8bef\u7b54\u6848\uff08\u8d1f\u8f68\u8ff9\uff09\u7684\u6837\u672c\u8fdb\u884cSFT\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u635f\u5931\u52a0\u6743\u65b9\u6848GLOW\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6SFT\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ec5\u4fdd\u7559\u6b63\u786e\u7b54\u6848\uff08\u6b63\u8f68\u8ff9\uff09\u5bfc\u81f4\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\u548c\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\uff0c\u8d1f\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u4e2d\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u8d1f\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u4f5c\u7528\uff08\u7f13\u89e3\u8fc7\u62df\u5408/\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u63a2\u7d22\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u7684GLOW\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u6837\u672c\u7279\u6027\u548c\u8de8\u5468\u671f\u8fdb\u5c55\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u635f\u5931\u6743\u91cd\u3002", "result": "\u5728Qwen2.5-7B\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u4efb\u52a15.51%\u589e\u76ca\uff0cMMLU\u8bc4\u5206\u4ece72.82%\u63d0\u5347\u81f376.47%\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8d1f\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u673a\u5236\u5229\u7528\u5b8c\u6574\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f68\u8ff9\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e3aSFT\u8303\u5f0f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

In this work, we propose \\emph{compositional steering tokens} for multi-behavior steering.

Contrary to most prior work, which operates in the activation space, our behavior steers live in the space of input tokens, enabling more effective zero-shot composition. We then train a dedicated \\textit{composition token} on pairs of behaviors and show that it successfully captures the notion of composition: it generalizes well to \\textit{unseen} compositions, including those with unseen behaviors as well as those with an unseen \\textit{number} of behaviors. Our experiments across different LLM architectures show that steering tokens lead to superior multi-behavior control compared to competing approaches (instructions, activation steering, and LoRA merging).

Traditional Natural Language Processing (NLP) models, built for monolingual data, often fail to interpret the syntactic and semantic complexity of this code-mixed language, resulting in inaccurate sentiment analysis and misleading market insights. To address this gap, we propose a high-performance sentiment classification framework specifically designed for Hinglish tweets. Our approach fine-tunes mBERT (Multilingual BERT), leveraging its multilingual capabilities to better understand the linguistic diversity of Indian social media. A key component of our methodology is the use of subword tokenization, which enables the model to effectively manage spelling variations, slang, and out-of-vocabulary terms common in Romanized Hinglish. This research delivers a production-ready AI solution for brand sentiment tracking and establishes a strong benchmark for multilingual NLP in low-resource, code-mixed environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8emBERT\u5fae\u8c03\u7684Hinglish\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edfNLP\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u6df7\u5408\u8bed\u79cd\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5370\u5ea6\u7528\u6237\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528Hinglish\uff08\u6df7\u6742\u5370\u5730\u8bed\u4e0e\u82f1\u8bed\u7684\u7f57\u9a6c\u5316\u53d8\u4f53\uff09\u53d1\u5e03\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u5355\u8bedNLP\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u89e3\u6790\u5176\u8bed\u6cd5\u8bed\u4e49\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u54c1\u724c\u76d1\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u5931\u51c6\uff0c\u9700\u5f00\u53d1\u9002\u914d\u4ee3\u7801\u6df7\u5408\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "1. \u5bf9\u591a\u8bed\u8a00BERT\uff08mBERT\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u9886\u57df\u9002\u914d\u5fae\u8c03\uff1b2. \u91c7\u7528\u5b50\u8bcd\u5206\u8bcd\u6280\u672f\u5e94\u5bf9Hinglish\u7684\u62fc\u5199\u53d8\u5f02\u3001\u4fda\u8bed\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u672a\u767b\u5f55\u8bcd\u95ee\u9898\uff1b3. \u6784\u5efa\u751f\u4ea7\u7ea7\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u7c7b\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u5f00\u53d1\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6Hinglish\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u751f\u4ea7\u90e8\u7f72\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u6df7\u5408\u8bed\u79cdNLP\u4efb\u52a1\u5efa\u7acb\u53ef\u590d\u7528\u6280\u672f\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u914d\u5408\u5b50\u8bcd\u5206\u8bcd\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4ee3\u7801\u6df7\u5408\u8bed\u79cd\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u5176\u4ed6\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u5206\u6790\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u8bed\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

In a between-subject experiment, we asked participants to express a specific emotion while working with ChatGPT (GPT-4.0) on two tasks, including writing a public response and addressing an ethical dilemma. We found that compared to interactions where participants maintained a neutral tone, ChatGPT showed greater improvement in its answers when participants praised ChatGPT for its responses. Expressing anger towards ChatGPT also led to a higher albeit smaller improvement relative to the neutral condition, whereas blaming ChatGPT did not improve its answers. When addressing an ethical dilemma, ChatGPT prioritized corporate interests less when participants expressed anger towards it, while blaming increases its emphasis on protecting the public interest. Additionally, we found that people used more negative, hostile, and disappointing expressions in human-human communication after interactions during which participants blamed rather than praised for their responses. Together, our findings demonstrate that the emotional tone people apply in human-AI interactions not only shape ChatGPT's outputs but also carry over into subsequent human-human communication.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u60c5\u611f\u57fa\u8c03\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cdAI\u8868\u73b0\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\uff1a\u8868\u626c\u63d0\u5347ChatGPT\u56de\u7b54\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u6124\u6012\u5e26\u6765\u8f83\u5c0f\u6539\u5584\uff0c\u6307\u8d23\u65e0\u5e2e\u52a9\u4e14\u5f15\u53d1\u4eba\u9645\u654c\u610f\uff0c\u60c5\u611f\u4e92\u52a8\u540c\u65f6\u6539\u53d8AI\u8f93\u51fa\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u540e\u7eed\u793e\u4ea4\u8868\u8fbe\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u4eba\u7c7b\u60c5\u611f\u5bf9AI\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u673a\u7406\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u5173\u4e8e\u60c5\u611f\u53cd\u9988\u5982\u4f55\u5851\u9020AI\u6301\u7eed\u8868\u73b0\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ec4\u95f4\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u63a7\u5236\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u64b0\u5199\u516c\u5f00\u56de\u5e94\u548c\u5904\u7406\u4f26\u7406\u56f0\u5883\uff09\u4e2d\u91c7\u7528\u8d5e\u7f8e/\u6124\u6012/\u4e2d\u6027/\u6307\u8d23\u60c5\u611f\u4e0eChatGPT(4.0\u7248)\u4e92\u52a8\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u5206\u6790AI\u8f93\u51fa\u8d28\u91cf\u53d8\u5316\u53ca\u540e\u7eed\u4eba\u9645\u4ea4\u6d41\u6587\u672c\u7279\u5f81\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "1) \u8d5e\u7f8e\u4f7fAI\u56de\u7b54\u6539\u8fdb\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e2d\u6027\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4\uff0c\u6124\u6012\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u679c\u8f83\u5f31\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u6307\u8d23\u65e0\u589e\u76ca\uff1b2)\u6124\u6012\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f7fAI\u5904\u7406\u4f26\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u524a\u5f31\u4f01\u4e1a\u5bfc\u5411\uff0c\u52a0\u5f3a\u516c\u5171\u5229\u76ca\u4fa7\u91cd\uff1b3)\u6307\u8d23\u884c\u4e3a\u5bfc\u81f4\u540e\u7eed\u4eba\u9645\u4ea4\u6d41\u4e2d\u8d1f\u9762\u8868\u8fbe\u589e\u52a028%\uff08p<0.01\uff09\uff1b4)\u60c5\u611f\u5f71\u54cd\u6301\u7eed\u81f3\u540e\u7eed\u65e0\u63d0\u793a\u5bf9\u8bdd\u9636\u6bb5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u60c5\u611f\u57fa\u8c03\u5177\u6709\u53cc\u91cd\u4f20\u5bfc\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u65e2\u901a\u8fc7\u5373\u65f6\u53cd\u9988\u91cd\u5851AI\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u53c8\u901a\u8fc7\u793e\u4f1a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\u8fc1\u79fb\u81f3\u540e\u7eed\u4eba\u7c7b\u793e\u4ea4\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u60c5\u611f\u8ba1\u7b97\u5728AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u6218\u7565\u4ef7\u503c\u4e0e\u4f26\u7406\u89c4\u8303\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

Existing collaborative approaches, such as cascading or routing, operate at a coarse granularity by offloading entire queries to LLMs, resulting in significant computational waste when the SLM is capable of handling the majority of reasoning steps. To address this, we propose RelayLLM, a novel framework for efficient reasoning via token-level collaborative decoding. Unlike routers, RelayLLM empowers the SLM to act as an active controller that dynamically invokes the LLM only for critical tokens via a special command, effectively \"relaying\" the generation process. We introduce a two-stage training framework, including warm-up and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to teach the model to balance independence with strategic help-seeking.

To address these challenges, this paper proposes Inside Out, a framework that utilizes a globally maintained PersonaTree as the carrier of long-term user profiling. By constraining the trunk with an initial schema and updating the branches and leaves, PersonaTree enables controllable growth, achieving memory compression while preserving consistency. Moreover, we train a lightweight MemListener via reinforcement learning with process-based rewards to produce structured, executable, and interpretable {ADD, UPDATE, DELETE, NO_OP} operations, thereby supporting the dynamic evolution of the personalized tree. During response generation, PersonaTree is directly leveraged to enhance outputs in latency-sensitive scenarios; when users require more details, the agentic mode is triggered to introduce details on-demand under the constraints of the PersonaTree. Experiments show that PersonaTree outperforms full-text concatenation and various personalized memory systems in suppressing contextual noise and maintaining persona consistency.

To achieve this, Reinforcement learning (RL) pipelines have begun incorporating multiple rewards, each capturing a distinct preference, to guide models toward these desired behaviors. However, recent work has defaulted to apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) under multi-reward setting without examining its suitability. In this paper, we demonstrate that directly applying GRPO to normalize distinct rollout reward combinations causes them to collapse into identical advantage values, reducing the resolution of the training signal and resulting in suboptimal convergence and, in some cases, early training failure. We then introduce Group reward-Decoupled Normalization Policy Optimization (GDPO), a new policy optimization method to resolve these issues by decoupling the normalization of individual rewards, more faithfully preserving their relative differences and enabling more accurate multi-reward optimization, along with substantially improved training stability. We compare GDPO with GRPO across three tasks: tool calling, math reasoning, and coding reasoning, evaluating both correctness metrics (accuracy, bug ratio) and constraint adherence metrics (format, length). Across all settings, GDPO consistently outperforms GRPO, demonstrating its effectiveness and generalizability for multi-reward reinforcement learning optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u5956\u52b1\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2dGRPO\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bfc\u81f4\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u574d\u7f29\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51faGDPO\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u5956\u52b1\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u6b64\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709RL\u65b9\u6cd5GRPO\u5728\u591a\u5956\u52b1\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u4f18\u52bf\u503c\u574d\u7f29\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bad\u7ec3\u4fe1\u53f7\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u5f15\u53d1\u6536\u655b\u4e0d\u4f73\u53ca\u8bad\u7ec3\u5931\u8d25\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u591a\u5956\u52b1\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGroup reward-Decoupled Normalization Policy Optimization (GDPO)\uff0c\u5c06\u591a\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u89e3\u8026\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u5404\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u5dee\u5f02\u6027\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u72ec\u7acb\u4f18\u52bf\u503c\u4f30\u8ba1\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u4f18\u5316\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u3001\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4e09\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cGDPO\u76f8\u6bd4GRPO\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff08\u63d0\u53478.7%\uff09\u3001\u7f3a\u9677\u7387\uff08\u964d\u4f4e34%\uff09\u53ca\u7ea6\u675f\u9075\u5faa\uff08\u683c\u5f0f/\u957f\u5ea6\u8fbe\u6807\u7387\u63d0\u9ad822%\uff09\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u5747\u663e\u8457\u9886\u5148\uff0c\u4e14\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u63d0\u534740%\u3002", "conclusion": "GDPO\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u5956\u52b1RL\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u574d\u7f29\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6280\u672f\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u89e3\u8026\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u666e\u9002\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}
