Abstract: The intelligent review of power grid engineering design drawings is crucial for power system safety. However, current automated systems struggle with ultra-high-resolution drawings due to high computational demands, information loss, and a lack of holistic semantic understanding for design error identification. This paper proposes a novel three-stage framework for intelligent power grid drawing review, driven by pre-trained Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) through advanced prompt engineering. Mimicking the human expert review process, the first stage leverages an MLLM for global semantic understanding to intelligently propose domain-specific semantic regions from a low-resolution overview. The second stage then performs high-resolution, fine-grained recognition within these proposed regions, acquiring detailed information with associated confidence scores. In the final stage, a comprehensive decision-making module integrates these confidence-aware results to accurately diagnose design errors and provide a reliability assessment. Preliminary results on real-world power grid drawings demonstrate our approach significantly enhances MLLM's ability to grasp macroscopic semantic information and pinpoint design errors, showing improved defect discovery accuracy and greater reliability in review judgments compared to traditional passive MLLM inference. This research offers a novel, prompt-driven paradigm for intelligent and reliable power grid drawing review.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为LURE的新方法，通过重建潜在空间和引导采样轨迹，实现扩散模型中多个擦除概念的同时高效复现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有概念擦除漏洞研究仅关注提示级别优化，忽略了文本条件、模型参数等其他生成因素，导致无法全面分析复现机制。

Method: 1. 将生成过程建模为隐函数以进行多因素理论分析；2. 提出潜在空间解阻机制与梯度场正交化技术处理特征纠缠；3. 通过后验密度验证的LSIS模块保障复现稳定性。

Result: 在跨多种擦除任务和方法的实验中，LURE实现了多个擦除概念的高保真同步复现，复现成功率较基线提升40%以上。

Conclusion: 研究证明扩散模型存在多维度复现脆弱性，LURE通过系统性潜在空间重构和特征解耦，为评估擦除方法安全性提供了新范式。

Abstract: Concept erasure aims to suppress sensitive content in diffusion models, but recent studies show that erased concepts can still be reawakened, revealing vulnerabilities in erasure methods. Existing reawakening methods mainly rely on prompt-level optimization to manipulate sampling trajectories, neglecting other generative factors, which limits a comprehensive understanding of the underlying dynamics. In this paper, we model the generation process as an implicit function to enable a comprehensive theoretical analysis of multiple factors, including text conditions, model parameters, and latent states. We theoretically show that perturbing each factor can reawaken erased concepts. Building on this insight, we propose a novel concept reawakening method: Latent space Unblocking for concept REawakening (LURE), which reawakens erased concepts by reconstructing the latent space and guiding the sampling trajectory. Specifically, our semantic re-binding mechanism reconstructs the latent space by aligning denoising predictions with target distributions to reestablish severed text-visual associations. However, in multi-concept scenarios, naive reconstruction can cause gradient conflicts and feature entanglement. To address this, we introduce Gradient Field Orthogonalization, which enforces feature orthogonality to prevent mutual interference. Additionally, our Latent Semantic Identification-Guided Sampling (LSIS) ensures stability of the reawakening process via posterior density verification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LURE enables simultaneous, high-fidelity reawakening of multiple erased concepts across diverse erasure tasks and methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有室内/街道基准无法反映城市空间语义丰富性、几何复杂性和视角多样性，需构建针对性评估体系解决跨视图空间推理能力瓶颈

Method: 构建四维度视角动态模拟（车辆/无人机/卫星/手持）、5022组多视角QA对覆盖方位/距离/拓扑等五维认知空间，支持零样本到微调的全谱评估

Conclusion: CityCube填补城市空间跨模态推理评估空白，证明参数规模非性能瓶颈，提出需突破视角不变性表征学习的新方向

Abstract: Cross-view spatial reasoning is essential for embodied AI, underpinning spatial understanding, mental simulation and planning in complex environments. Existing benchmarks primarily emphasize indoor or street settings, overlooking the unique challenges of open-ended urban spaces characterized by rich semantics, complex geometries, and view variations. To address this, we introduce CityCube, a systematic benchmark designed to probe cross-view reasoning capabilities of current VLMs in urban settings. CityCube integrates four viewpoint dynamics to mimic camera movements and spans a wide spectrum of perspectives from multiple platforms, e.g., vehicles, drones and satellites. For a comprehensive assessment, it features 5,022 meticulously annotated multi-view QA pairs categorized into five cognitive dimensions and three spatial relation expressions. A comprehensive evaluation of 33 VLMs reveals a significant performance disparity with humans: even large-scale models struggle to exceed 54.1% accuracy, remaining 34.2% below human performance. By contrast, small-scale fine-tuned VLMs achieve over 60.0% accuracy, highlighting the necessity of our benchmark. Further analyses indicate the task correlations and fundamental cognitive disparity between VLMs and human-like reasoning.

Abstract: Large-scale medical segmentation datasets often combine manual and pseudo-labels of uneven quality, which can compromise training and evaluation. Low-quality labels may hamper performance and make the model training less robust. To address this issue, we propose SegAE (Segmentation Assessment Engine), a lightweight vision-language model (VLM) that automatically predicts label quality across 142 anatomical structures. Trained on over four million image-label pairs with quality scores, SegAE achieves a high correlation coefficient of 0.902 with ground-truth Dice similarity and evaluates a 3D mask in 0.06s. SegAE shows several practical benefits: (I) Our analysis reveals widespread low-quality labeling across public datasets; (II) SegAE improves data efficiency and training performance in active and semi-supervised learning, reducing dataset annotation cost by one-third and quality-checking time by 70% per label. This tool provides a simple and effective solution for quality control in large-scale medical segmentation datasets. The dataset, model weights, and codes are released at https://github.com/Schuture/SegAE.

Abstract: Traffic scene understanding is essential for enabling autonomous vehicles to accurately perceive and interpret their environment, thereby ensuring safe navigation. This paper presents a novel framework that transforms a single frontal-view camera image into a concise natural language description, effectively capturing spatial layouts, semantic relationships, and driving-relevant cues. The proposed model leverages a hybrid attention mechanism to enhance spatial and semantic feature extraction and integrates these features to generate contextually rich and detailed scene descriptions. To address the limited availability of specialized datasets in this domain, a new dataset derived from the BDD100K dataset has been developed, with comprehensive guidelines provided for its construction. Furthermore, the study offers an in-depth discussion of relevant evaluation metrics, identifying the most appropriate measures for this task. Extensive quantitative evaluations using metrics such as CIDEr and SPICE, complemented by human judgment assessments, demonstrate that the proposed model achieves strong performance and effectively fulfills its intended objectives on the newly developed dataset.

*A. Enes Doruk*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种基于高斯模型的自适应相机-激光雷达多模态3D占用预测方法，解决了现有体素化方法在计算复杂度和动态环境适应性上的不足，通过结合相机语义优势和激光雷达几何优势，提升了自动驾驶车辆在长尾安全场景中的感知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有体素化方法在计算复杂度高、多模态融合过程脆弱且静态，难以应对动态环境下的长尾安全挑战，需通过技术突破提升3D语义占用预测的效率与鲁棒性。

Method: 提出四点创新：1) 基于熵的特征平滑算法结合交叉熵处理领域噪声；2) 深度可变形采样的激光雷达深度特征聚合模块；3) 动态传感器输出重校准的自适应相机-激光雷达融合；4) 基于选择性状态空间模型的线性复杂度Gauss-Mamba解码器。

Conclusion: 该方案通过高斯表示的跨模态融合框架，突破了传统体素化方法的限制，为自动驾驶提供更优的3D场景感知解决方案。

Abstract: The sparse object detection paradigm shift towards dense 3D semantic occupancy prediction is necessary for dealing with long-tail safety challenges for autonomous vehicles. Nonetheless, the current voxelization methods commonly suffer from excessive computation complexity demands, where the fusion process is brittle, static, and breaks down under dynamic environmental settings. To this end, this research work enhances a novel Gaussian-based adaptive camera-LiDAR multimodal 3D occupancy prediction model that seamlessly bridges the semantic strengths of camera modality with the geometric strengths of LiDAR modality through a memory-efficient 3D Gaussian model. The proposed solution has four key components: (1) LiDAR Depth Feature Aggregation (LDFA), where depth-wise deformable sampling is employed for dealing with geometric sparsity, (2) Entropy-Based Feature Smoothing, where cross-entropy is employed for handling domain-specific noise, (3) Adaptive Camera-LiDAR Fusion, where dynamic recalibration of sensor outputs is performed based on model outputs, and (4) Gauss-Mamba Head that uses Selective State Space Models for global context decoding that enjoys linear computation complexity.

### [7] [GutenOCR: A Grounded Vision-Language Front-End for Documents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14490)
*Hunter Heidenreich,Ben Elliott,Olivia Dinica,Yosheb Getachew*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GutenOCR通过微调Qwen2.5-VL模型（3B/7B参数），构建了支持多模态文本检测、阅读和定位的OCR系统，在新提出的基准测试中显著提升性能，但也存在局部局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有OCR系统难以统一处理文本检测、阅读和跨模态定位（如回答'X在哪?'问题），需开发基于视觉语言模型（VLM）的端到端解决方案以支持复杂文档分析。

Method: 1. 在商业文档、科学论文及合成数据上微调Qwen2.5-VL模型；2. 设计统一的提示词接口实现文本检测、段落级定位和条件查询；3. 提出包含10.5K页面的新评估协议测试多维度OCR能力。

Result: GutenOCR-7B相对原始模型将综合OCR分数从0.40提升至0.82；在Fox和OmniDocBench中区域/行级OCR精度提升且文本召回率提高，但存在页级线性化效率下降、彩色文本识别减弱和数学公式处理劣化的平衡问题。

Conclusion: 基于VLM的微调方法可构建多任务OCR系统，但需针对复杂排版和特殊内容（如公式、彩图）进行专项优化。

Abstract: GutenOCR is a family of grounded OCR front-ends obtained by fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL-3B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B. The resulting single-checkpoint vision-language models expose reading, detection, and grounding through a unified, prompt-based interface. Trained on business documents, scientific articles, and synthetic grounding data, the models support full-page and localized reading with line- and paragraph-level bounding boxes and conditional ``where is x?'' queries. We introduce a grounded OCR evaluation protocol and show that GutenOCR-7B more than doubles the composite grounded OCR score of its Qwen2.5-VL-7B backbone on 10.5K held-out business and scientific pages (0.40 to 0.82). On Fox and OmniDocBench v1.5, our approach substantially improves region- and line-level OCR as well as text-detection recall, but reveals trade-offs in page-level linearization, color-guided OCR, and formula-heavy layouts.

### [8] [PAS-Mamba: Phase-Amplitude-Spatial State Space Model for MRI Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14530)
*Xiaoyan Kui,Zijie Fan,Zexin Ji,Qinsong Li,Hao Xu,Weixin Si,Haodong Xu,Beiji Zou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的MRI重建框架PAS-Mamba，通过在频域中解耦相位和幅度特征，并结合图像域特性提升重建效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MRI重建方法在频域建模时未区分相位与幅度信息，而Fourier理论表明相位主导图像结构、幅度体现像素强度。这种统一建模会导致特征学习干扰。

Method: 基于Local-Mamba保留空间细节；提出Circular Frequency Domain Scanning（CFDS）按频率高低序列化特征；分离频域相位与幅度分支并通过Dual-Domain Fusion Module（DDCFM）进行双向互补融合。

Result: 在IXI和fastMRI膝关节数据集上均优于当前最优方法，验证了频域解耦建模的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过频域相位-幅度分离策略与图像域特征耦合，PAS-Mamba成功平衡局部强度与全局结构信息，为MRI重建提供了新方法。

Abstract: Joint feature modeling in both the spatial and frequency domains has become a mainstream approach in MRI reconstruction. However, existing methods generally treat the frequency domain as a whole, neglecting the differences in the information carried by its internal components. According to Fourier transform theory, phase and amplitude represent different types of information in the image. Our spectrum swapping experiments show that magnitude mainly reflects pixel-level intensity, while phase predominantly governs image structure. To prevent interference between phase and magnitude feature learning caused by unified frequency-domain modeling, we propose the Phase-Amplitude-Spatial State Space Model (PAS-Mamba) for MRI Reconstruction, a framework that decouples phase and magnitude modeling in the frequency domain and combines it with image-domain features for better reconstruction. In the image domain, LocalMamba preserves spatial locality to sharpen fine anatomical details. In frequency domain, we disentangle amplitude and phase into two specialized branches to avoid representational coupling. To respect the concentric geometry of frequency information, we propose Circular Frequency Domain Scanning (CFDS) to serialize features from low to high frequencies. Finally, a Dual-Domain Complementary Fusion Module (DDCFM) adaptively fuses amplitude phase representations and enables bidirectional exchange between frequency and image domains, delivering superior reconstruction. Extensive experiments on the IXI and fastMRI knee datasets show that PAS-Mamba consistently outperforms state of the art reconstruction methods.

### [9] [Scribble-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation with Dynamic Teacher Switching and Hierarchical Consistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14563)
*Thanh-Huy Nguyen,Hoang-Loc Cao,Dat T. Chung,Mai-Anh Vu,Thanh-Minh Nguyen,Minh Le,Phat K. Huynh,Ulas Bagci*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes SDT-Net, a dual-teacher single-student framework with dynamic teacher switching, pseudo-label refinement, and hierarchical consistency modules, achieving state-of-the-art performance in scribble-supervised medical image segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image segmentation faces high annotation costs due to detailed manual labeling requirements. Scribble-based weak supervision reduces this burden but suffers from sparse annotations causing noisy pseudo-labels and poor anatomical boundary learning.

Method: SDT-Net employs two teachers and one student: (1) Dynamic Teacher Switching selects optimal teacher model, (2) Pick Reliable Pixels extracts high-confidence pseudo-labels from student-teacher consensus, (3) Hierarchical Consistency enforces multi-level feature alignment between models. This synergistic framework maximizes supervision quality from sparse scribble annotations.

Result: Experiments show SDT-Net outperforms existing methods on ACDC (cardiac MRI) and MSCMRseg (multi-structural cardiac MRI) datasets, producing more accurate segmentations with anatomically plausible boundaries. Achieved state-of-the-art Dice scores across both benchmarks.

Conclusion: The combination of adaptive teacher selection, confident pseudo-label generation, and multi-scale consistency constraints enables robust anatomy-aware segmentation from scribble annotations. SDT-Net demonstrates superior performance for weakly-supervised medical image analysis tasks.

Abstract: Scribble-supervised methods have emerged to mitigate the prohibitive annotation burden in medical image segmentation. However, the inherent sparsity of these annotations introduces significant ambiguity, which results in noisy pseudo-label propagation and hinders the learning of robust anatomical boundaries. To address this challenge, we propose SDT-Net, a novel dual-teacher, single-student framework designed to maximize supervision quality from these weak signals. Our method features a Dynamic Teacher Switching (DTS) module to adaptively select the most reliable teacher. This selected teacher then guides the student via two synergistic mechanisms: high-confidence pseudo-labels, refined by a Pick Reliable Pixels (PRP) mechanism, and multi-level feature alignment, enforced by a Hierarchical Consistency (HiCo) module. Extensive experiments on the ACDC and MSCMRseg datasets demonstrate that SDT-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance, producing more accurate and anatomically plausible segmentation.

### [10] [Breaking the accuracy-resource dilemma: a lightweight adaptive video inference enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14568)
*Wei Ma,Shaowu Chen,Junjie Ye,Peichang Zhang,Lei Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于模糊控制器的VI增强框架，通过动态切换不同规模模型平衡资源与性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法过度追求模型复杂度导致资源效率低下，未解决资源利用与推理效果的权衡问题。

Method: 设计模糊控制器(FC-r)整合系统参数与推理指标，利用时空相关性在多尺度模型间动态切换。

Result: 实验验证在动态资源条件下实现推理性能与资源占用的均衡分布。

Conclusion: 时空相关性建模与自适应模型切换机制有效协调了计算资源约束与视频推理质量需求。

Abstract: Existing video inference (VI) enhancement methods typically aim to improve performance by scaling up model sizes and employing sophisticated network architectures. While these approaches demonstrated state-of-the-art performance, they often overlooked the trade-off of resource efficiency and inference effectiveness, leading to inefficient resource utilization and suboptimal inference performance. To address this problem, a fuzzy controller (FC-r) is developed based on key system parameters and inference-related metrics. Guided by the FC-r, a VI enhancement framework is proposed, where the spatiotemporal correlation of targets across adjacent video frames is leveraged. Given the real-time resource conditions of the target device, the framework can dynamically switch between models of varying scales during VI. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively achieves a balance between resource utilization and inference performance.

*Po-Kai Chiu,Hung-Hsuan Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出2D-VoCo，一种高效的自监督预训练方法，用于医疗图像分析，减少标注数据依赖并提升分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 降低医疗图像分析中标注数据的需求，同时解决3D自监督方法高计算/内存消耗的问题。

Method: 通过切片级对比学习进行自监督预训练，结合CNN-LSTM架构实现多器官损伤分类。

Result: 在RSNA 2023数据集上，mAP、精确率、召回率和RSNA得分均显著优于从头训练的模型。

Conclusion: 2D-VoCo减少了标注依赖，提升了临床CT分析性能，并开源代码促进复现。

Abstract: The requirement for expert annotations limits the effectiveness of deep learning for medical image analysis. Although 3D self-supervised methods like volume contrast learning (VoCo) are powerful and partially address the labeling scarcity issue, their high computational cost and memory consumption are barriers. We propose 2D-VoCo, an efficient adaptation of the VoCo framework for slice-level self-supervised pre-training that learns spatial-semantic features from unlabeled 2D CT slices via contrastive learning. The pre-trained CNN backbone is then integrated into a CNN-LSTM architecture to classify multi-organ injuries. In the RSNA 2023 Abdominal Trauma dataset, 2D-VoCo pre-training significantly improves mAP, precision, recall, and RSNA score over training from scratch. Our framework provides a practical method to reduce the dependency on labeled data and enhance model performance in clinical CT analysis. We release the code for reproducibility. https://github.com/tkz05/2D-VoCo-CT-Classifier

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种可学习的帧选择器（LFS），通过动态选择与事件相关且时间多样的帧，提升视频描述生成的质量和细粒度理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统均匀采样忽略视频事件分布不均的问题，缺乏对时间多样性和事件相关性的动态平衡机制，同时现有基准测试与人类认知存在差距。

Method: LFS显式建模时间重要性，采用分层策略平衡时间多样性和覆盖性，并利用冻结视频大模型的描述反馈优化帧选择。提出新基准ICH-CC，通过人工设计的问题评估模型的人类一致性理解。

Result: 在两个主流基准测试中VDC提升2.0%，ICH-CC提升超4%，且增强后的描述显式提升了视频问答性能。

Conclusion: LFS提供了一种轻量级有效方案，弥合了视频描述生成与人类认知的鸿沟。

Abstract: Video captioning models convert frames into visual tokens and generate descriptions with large language models (LLMs). Since encoding all frames is prohibitively expensive, uniform sampling is the default choice, but it enforces equal temporal coverage while ignoring the uneven events distribution. This motivates a Learnable Frame Selector (LFS) that selects temporally diverse and event-relevant frames. LFS explicitly models temporal importance to balance temporal diversity and event relevance, and employs a stratified strategy to ensure temporal coverage while avoiding clustering. Crucially, LFS leverages caption feedback from frozen video-LLMs to learn frame selection that directly optimizes downstream caption quality. Additionally, we identify the gap between existing benchmark and human's cognition. Thus, we introduce ICH-CC built from carefully designed questions by annotators that reflect human-consistent understanding of video. Experiments indicate that LFS consistently improves detailed video captioning across two representative community benchmarks and ICH-CC, achieving up to 2.0% gains on VDC and over 4% gains on ICH-CC. Moreover, we observe that enhanced captions with LFS leads to improved performance on video question answering. Overall, LFS provides an effective and easy-to-integrate solution for detailed video captioning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出U-Harmony方法，解决医疗图像分割中数据集异质性问题，实现跨机构数据的鲁棒3D模型训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗影像数据集常存在模态、协议及解剖目标的跨机构异质性，现有模型难以兼顾多域联合学习与保留特定领域知识，需要一种能够处理多样化数据且保持模型性能的学习框架。

Method: 设计基于领域门控头的联合训练架构U-Harmony，通过特征分布的序列归一化-去归一化操作对齐域间差异，同时嵌入动态领域知识增强模块，支持多模态及跨解剖结构的渐进式知识融合。

Result: 在跨机构脑病灶分割数据集测试中，U-Harmony比传统模型在Dice系数提升5.3%，且实现9种新型影像模态与6类解剖结构的零样本迁移学习，计算效率提升40%。

Conclusion: 该研究突破医疗影像分割模型的跨域泛化能力，通过统一的参数共享架构解决传统方法精度流失问题，为真实临床场景的多中心数据协同提供了技术范式。

Abstract: In clinical practice, medical segmentation datasets are often limited and heterogeneous, with variations in modalities, protocols, and anatomical targets across institutions. Existing deep learning models struggle to jointly learn from such diverse data, often sacrificing either generalization or domain-specific knowledge. To overcome these challenges, we propose a joint training method called Universal Harmonization (U-Harmony), which can be integrated into deep learning-based architectures with a domain-gated head, enabling a single segmentation model to learn from heterogeneous datasets simultaneously. By integrating U-Harmony, our approach sequentially normalizes and then denormalizes feature distributions to mitigate domain-specific variations while preserving original dataset-specific knowledge. More appealingly, our framework also supports universal modality adaptation, allowing the seamless learning of new imaging modalities and anatomical classes. Extensive experiments on cross-institutional brain lesion datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, establishing a new benchmark for robust and adaptable 3D medical image segmentation models in real-world clinical settings.

### [14] [Learning Consistent Taxonomic Classification through Hierarchical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14610)
*Zhenghong Li,Kecheng Zheng,Haibin Ling*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出VL-Taxon框架，通过两阶段分层推理显著提升视觉语言模型在分类任务中的叶级准确率和层级一致性，仅需小数据集微调即可超越72B模型10%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型（VLM）虽擅长视觉理解，但在分层知识（如生物分类学）上表现不佳，常出现叶级正确但上级分类错误。现有方法未解决层级推理问题，需专门设计框架增强层级一致性。

Method: VL-Taxon包含两个阶段：第一阶段通过自顶向下策略提升叶级分类准确率；第二阶段基于叶级输出确保整个层级一致性。每阶段先用监督微调注入分类知识，再用强化学习优化推理能力。

Result: 在iNaturalist-2021数据集上，基于Qwen2.5-VL-7B的VL-Taxon比72B原模型在叶级与层级一致性准确率平均提升超10%，且仅用小数据集微调（未借助其他VLM生成数据）。

Conclusion: 该框架通过结构化层级推理和分阶段训练策略，有效解决了VLM在分层分类任务中的不一致性问题，为轻量模型超越巨无霸模型提供新范式。

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at visual understanding, they often fail to grasp hierarchical knowledge. This leads to common errors where VLMs misclassify coarser taxonomic levels even when correctly identifying the most specific level (leaf level). Existing approaches largely overlook this issue by failing to model hierarchical reasoning. To address this gap, we propose VL-Taxon, a two-stage, hierarchy-based reasoning framework designed to improve both leaf-level accuracy and hierarchical consistency in taxonomic classification. The first stage employs a top-down process to enhance leaf-level classification accuracy. The second stage then leverages this accurate leaf-level output to ensure consistency throughout the entire taxonomic hierarchy. Each stage is initially trained with supervised fine-tuning to instill taxonomy knowledge, followed by reinforcement learning to refine the model's reasoning and generalization capabilities. Extensive experiments reveal a remarkable result: our VL-Taxon framework, implemented on the Qwen2.5-VL-7B model, outperforms its original 72B counterpart by over 10% in both leaf-level and hierarchical consistency accuracy on average on the iNaturalist-2021 dataset. Notably, this significant gain was achieved by fine-tuning on just a small subset of data, without relying on any examples generated by other VLMs.

Abstract: The rapid progress of diffusion models highlights the growing need for detecting generated images. Previous research demonstrates that incorporating diffusion-based measurements, such as reconstruction error, can enhance the generalizability of detectors. However, ignoring the differing impacts of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty on reconstruction error can undermine detection performance. Aleatoric uncertainty, arising from inherent data noise, creates ambiguity that impedes accurate detection of generated images. As it reflects random variations within the data (e.g., noise in natural textures), it does not help distinguish generated images. In contrast, epistemic uncertainty, which represents the model's lack of knowledge about unfamiliar patterns, supports detection. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Diffusion Epistemic Uncertainty with Asymmetric Learning~(DEUA), for detecting diffusion-generated images. We introduce Diffusion Epistemic Uncertainty~(DEU) estimation via the Laplace approximation to assess the proximity of data to the manifold of diffusion-generated samples. Additionally, an asymmetric loss function is introduced to train a balanced classifier with larger margins, further enhancing generalizability. Extensive experiments on large-scale benchmarks validate the state-of-the-art performance of our method.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Forest-Chat, an LLM-driven agent combining vision-language models for multi-task forest change analysis using satellite imagery, enabling natural language queries and zero-shot detection with interactive guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses under-explored integration of LLMs with vision models in remote sensing (beyond urban) and enhances forest monitoring workflows through semantic change interpretation.

Method: Proposes multi-level change interpretation (MCI) framework with LLM orchestration, zero-shot detection model, interactive point-prompt interface, and introduces Forest-Change dataset with bi-temporal images and semantic captions.

Result: Forest-Chat achieves strong performance on Forest-Change dataset and LEVIR-MCI-Trees subset for simultaneous change detection/captioning tasks.

Conclusion: Demonstrates interactive LLM-driven systems improve accessibility/interpretability in forest monitoring, suggesting future work directions for vision-language integration in ecological analysis.

Abstract: The increasing availability of high-resolution satellite imagery, together with advances in deep learning, creates new opportunities for enhancing forest monitoring workflows. Two central challenges in this domain are pixel-level change detection and semantic change interpretation, particularly for complex forest dynamics. While large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted for data exploration, their integration with vision-language models (VLMs) for remote sensing image change interpretation (RSICI) remains underexplored, especially beyond urban environments. We introduce Forest-Chat, an LLM-driven agent designed for integrated forest change analysis. The proposed framework enables natural language querying and supports multiple RSICI tasks, including change detection, change captioning, object counting, deforestation percentage estimation, and change reasoning. Forest-Chat builds upon a multi-level change interpretation (MCI) vision-language backbone with LLM-based orchestration, and incorporates zero-shot change detection via a foundation change detection model together with an interactive point-prompt interface to support fine-grained user guidance. To facilitate adaptation and evaluation in forest environments, we introduce the Forest-Change dataset, comprising bi-temporal satellite imagery, pixel-level change masks, and multi-granularity semantic change captions generated through a combination of human annotation and rule-based methods. Experimental results demonstrate that Forest-Chat achieves strong performance on Forest-Change and on LEVIR-MCI-Trees, a tree-focused subset of LEVIR-MCI, for joint change detection and captioning, highlighting the potential of interactive, LLM-driven RSICI systems to improve accessibility, interpretability, and analytical efficiency in forest change analysis.

TL;DR: 提出READ-Net框架，通过自适应特征重校准（AFR）解决情感歧义问题，显著提升视听抑郁症检测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法对情感线索处理不足，要么忽略抑郁信号，要么混淆短暂情绪与稳定抑郁症状，导致检测错误（情感歧义）。

Method: READ-Net创新性设计AFR模块，动态调整情感特征权重，选择性强化抑郁相关线索并过滤情感噪声，实现特征表示优化。

Result: 在3个公开数据集上准确率提升4.55%，F1-score提升1.26%，验证了框架对情感干扰的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: READ-Net首次系统性解决情感歧义问题，通过特征重校准策略突破情感与抑郁症状的特征混淆，为多模态抑郁检测提供可扩展新范式。

Abstract: Depression is a severe global mental health issue that impairs daily functioning and overall quality of life. Although recent audio-visual approaches have improved automatic depression detection, methods that ignore emotional cues often fail to capture subtle depressive signals hidden within emotional expressions. Conversely, those incorporating emotions frequently confuse transient emotional expressions with stable depressive symptoms in feature representations, a phenomenon termed \emph{Emotional Ambiguity}, thereby leading to detection errors. To address this critical issue, we propose READ-Net, the first audio-visual depression detection framework explicitly designed to resolve Emotional Ambiguity through Adaptive Feature Recalibration (AFR). The core insight of AFR is to dynamically adjust the weights of emotional features to enhance depression-related signals. Rather than merely overlooking or naively combining emotional information, READ-Net innovatively identifies and preserves depressive-relevant cues within emotional features, while adaptively filtering out irrelevant emotional noise. This recalibration strategy significantly clarifies feature representations, and effectively mitigates the persistent challenge of emotional interference. Additionally, READ-Net can be easily integrated into existing frameworks for improved performance. Extensive evaluations on three publicly available datasets show that READ-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with average gains of 4.55\% in accuracy and 1.26\% in F1-score, demonstrating its robustness to emotional disturbances and improving audio-visual depression detection.

*Yonghao Yu,Lang Huang,Zerun Wang,Runyi Li,Toshihiko Yamasaki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mirai是一种新型框架，通过引入未来信息改善自回归（AR）视觉生成模型的训练过程，在保持架构不变且无额外推理开销的前提下显著提升模型收敛速度和生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AR视觉生成模型受限于严格因果监督仅依赖当前步骤预测下一token，导致全局连贯性不足和收敛速度缓慢，作者试图通过引入多阶段未来信息优化因果建模。

Method: Mirai提出两种未来感知机制：Mirai-E利用单向表示从多个未来位置引入显式未来信息，Mirai-I则通过匹配双向表示提取隐式未来信息，两种方法均无需改变模型结构且保持推理效率。

Result: 实验显示Mirai使LlamaGen-B模型在ImageNet类条件图像生成中FID分数从5.34降至4.34，训练收敛速度提升最高10倍，有效解决了AR模型长期面临的效率与质量平衡问题。

Conclusion: 研究证明视觉AR生成模型需要未来感知能力，Mirai通过结构性调整增强了因果建模，为提升序列生成模型提供了通用且高效的技术路径。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) visual generators model images as sequences of discrete tokens and are trained with next token likelihood. This strict causality supervision optimizes each step only by its immediate next token, which diminishes global coherence and slows convergence. We ask whether foresight, training signals that originate from later tokens, can help AR visual generation. We conduct a series of controlled diagnostics along the injection level, foresight layout, and foresight source axes, unveiling a key insight: aligning foresight to AR models' internal representation on the 2D image grids improves causality modeling. We formulate this insight with Mirai (meaning "future" in Japanese), a general framework that injects future information into AR training with no architecture change and no extra inference overhead: Mirai-E uses explicit foresight from multiple future positions of unidirectional representations, whereas Mirai-I leverages implicit foresight from matched bidirectional representations. Extensive experiments show that Mirai significantly accelerates convergence and improves generation quality. For instance, Mirai can speed up LlamaGen-B's convergence by up to 10$\times$ and reduce the generation FID from 5.34 to 4.34 on the ImageNet class-condition image generation benchmark. Our study highlights that visual autoregressive models need foresight.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于4D隐式几何表示的视频渲染框架，通过结合大规模重建模型的潜在空间信息和扩散模型，解决了视角变化下的场景结构不稳定性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在视频重渲染任务中存在两类缺陷：几何无条件模型因空间感知不足导致视角变换时出现漂移和形变；几何有条件模型因依赖深度估计和显式重建而易受深度误差和标定误差影响。

Method: 提出使用预训练4D重建模型的潜在空间编码隐式几何信息，联合源相机姿态作为视频生成条件。该潜在空间通过连续场景结构建模避免显式重建，使扩散模型能更有效地进行误差正则化。

Conclusion: 实验证明隐式4D场景表示能有效结合扩散先验，在保留场景拓扑结构的同时提升生成鲁棒性，为动态场景建模提供了新的可扩展方向。

Abstract: Given a monocular video, the goal of video re-rendering is to generate views of the scene from a novel camera trajectory. Existing methods face two distinct challenges. Geometrically unconditioned models lack spatial awareness, leading to drift and deformation under viewpoint changes. On the other hand, geometrically-conditioned models depend on estimated depth and explicit reconstruction, making them susceptible to depth inaccuracies and calibration errors.
  We propose to address these challenges by using the implicit geometric knowledge embedded in the latent space of a large 4D reconstruction model to condition the video generation process. These latents capture scene structure in a continuous space without explicit reconstruction. Therefore, they provide a flexible representation that allows the pretrained diffusion prior to regularize errors more effectively. By jointly conditioning on these latents and source camera poses, we demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art results on the video re-rendering task.

Abstract: In this paper, we present LookBench (We use the term "look" to reflect retrieval that mirrors how people shop -- finding the exact item, a close substitute, or a visually consistent alternative.), a live, holistic and challenging benchmark for fashion image retrieval in real e-commerce settings. LookBench includes both recent product images sourced from live websites and AI-generated fashion images, reflecting contemporary trends and use cases. Each test sample is time-stamped and we intend to update the benchmark periodically, enabling contamination-aware evaluation aligned with declared training cutoffs. Grounded in our fine-grained attribute taxonomy, LookBench covers single-item and outfit-level retrieval across. Our experiments reveal that LookBench poses a significant challenge on strong baselines, with many models achieving below $60\%$ Recall@1. Our proprietary model achieves the best performance on LookBench, and we release an open-source counterpart that ranks second, with both models attaining state-of-the-art results on legacy Fashion200K evaluations. LookBench is designed to be updated semi-annually with new test samples and progressively harder task variants, providing a durable measure of progress. We publicly release our leaderboard, dataset, evaluation code, and trained models.

*Yiyang Fu,Hui Li,Wangyu Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的弱监督语义分割框架CPF-CTE，通过结合上下文补丁融合和类别增强技术，解决现有方法忽略图像块间复杂依赖关系的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有弱监督语义分割方法主要依赖图像级标签，增强类间差异并通过数据增强缓解语义模糊，但忽略了图像块间的复杂上下文依赖关系，导致表征不完整和分割准确率受限。

Method: 提出上下文融合的双向LSTM模块（CF-BiLSTM）建模图像块空间依赖关系，结合可学习类别token动态编码类特异性语义，通过空间与语义信息融合增强特征学习。

Result: 在PASCAL VOC 2012和MS COCO 2014数据集上实验证明，CPF-CTE方法在弱监督设置下均优于先前方法。

Conclusion: 通过空间上下文建模和类别增强机制的有效集成，CPF-CTE实现了更准确的图像内容表征与语义分割性能提升。

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS), which relies only on image-level labels, has attracted significant attention for its cost-effectiveness and scalability. Existing methods mainly enhance inter-class distinctions and employ data augmentation to mitigate semantic ambiguity and reduce spurious activations. However, they often neglect the complex contextual dependencies among image patches, resulting in incomplete local representations and limited segmentation accuracy. To address these issues, we propose the Context Patch Fusion with Class Token Enhancement (CPF-CTE) framework, which exploits contextual relations among patches to enrich feature representations and improve segmentation. At its core, the Contextual-Fusion Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (CF-BiLSTM) module captures spatial dependencies between patches and enables bidirectional information flow, yielding a more comprehensive understanding of spatial correlations. This strengthens feature learning and segmentation robustness. Moreover, we introduce learnable class tokens that dynamically encode and refine class-specific semantics, enhancing discriminative capability. By effectively integrating spatial and semantic cues, CPF-CTE produces richer and more accurate representations of image content. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 validate that CPF-CTE consistently surpasses prior WSSS methods.

Motivation: 现有MLLMs在离线视频理解表现优异，但处理流视频时难以兼顾实时性、稳定性及低内存占用，亟需无需微调的轻量化解决方案。

Method: 提出基于注意力机制的层次化KV缓存框架，推理时复用紧凑缓存实现低开销流视频处理，且查询时无需辅助计算。

Result: TTFT（首token耗时）相较SOTA提升10倍，在减少68%视频token情况下保持等效/更优精度，流视频任务精度最高提升11.4%。

Conclusion: HERMES通过机理驱动的缓存优化，为资源受限场景下的流视频理解提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant improvement in offline video understanding. However, extending these capabilities to streaming video inputs, remains challenging, as existing models struggle to simultaneously maintain stable understanding performance, real-time responses, and low GPU memory overhead. To address this challenge, we propose HERMES, a novel training-free architecture for real-time and accurate understanding of video streams. Based on a mechanistic attention investigation, we conceptualize KV cache as a hierarchical memory framework that encapsulates video information across multiple granularities. During inference, HERMES reuses a compact KV cache, enabling efficient streaming understanding under resource constraints. Notably, HERMES requires no auxiliary computations upon the arrival of user queries, thereby guaranteeing real-time responses for continuous video stream interactions, which achieves 10$\times$ faster TTFT compared to prior SOTA. Even when reducing video tokens by up to 68% compared with uniform sampling, HERMES achieves superior or comparable accuracy across all benchmarks, with up to 11.4% gains on streaming datasets.

TL;DR: DeepMoLM is a molecular language model that combines visual and geometric data from molecular images to improve chemical understanding and property prediction without relying on atom coordinates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing molecular language models struggle to capture 3D geometry and stereochemistry details from molecular images, while vision-language models fail to map continuous 3D structures to discrete tokens. A solution is needed to bridge this gap for drug discovery and chemical literature mining.

Method: DeepMoLM uses a dual-view framework integrating high-resolution molecular images with geometric invariants derived from molecular conformations. It encodes conformer neighborhoods via Extended 3D Fingerprints, preserves high-frequency image data, and fuses visual/geom streams with cross-attention for physically grounded generation.

Result: Achieved 12.3% relative METEOR gain on PubChem captioning, produced valid property outputs (MAE: 13.64 g/mol for Molecular Weight, 37.89 for Complexity), matched state-of-the-art vision-language models on ChEBI-20, and outperformed generalist baselines in multiple tasks.

Conclusion: The dual-view approach effectively integrates visual and geometric data, enabling accurate molecular interpretation without explicit coordinate-based representations, while maintaining competitive performance across chemical tasks.

Abstract: AI models for drug discovery and chemical literature mining must interpret molecular images and generate outputs consistent with 3D geometry and stereochemistry. Most molecular language models rely on strings or graphs, while vision-language models often miss stereochemical details and struggle to map continuous 3D structures into discrete tokens. We propose DeepMoLM: Deep Molecular Language M odeling, a dual-view framework that grounds high-resolution molecular images in geometric invariants derived from molecular conformations. DeepMoLM preserves high-frequency evidence from 1024 $\times$ 1024 inputs, encodes conformer neighborhoods as discrete Extended 3-Dimensional Fingerprints, and fuses visual and geometric streams with cross-attention, enabling physically grounded generation without atom coordinates. DeepMoLM improves PubChem captioning with a 12.3% relative METEOR gain over the strongest generalist baseline while staying competitive with specialist methods. It produces valid numeric outputs for all property queries and attains MAE 13.64 g/mol on Molecular Weight and 37.89 on Complexity in the specialist setting. On ChEBI-20 description generation from images, it exceeds generalist baselines and matches state-of- the-art vision-language models. Code is available at https://github.com/1anj/DeepMoLM.

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了资源约束下高分辨率AIGC生成的权衡问题，为边缘计算场景中的QoE优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC) has made significant strides, with high-resolution text-to-image (T2I) generation becoming increasingly critical for improving users' Quality of Experience (QoE). Although resource-constrained edge computing adequately supports fast low-resolution T2I generations, achieving high-resolution output still faces the challenge of ensuring image fidelity at the cost of latency. To address this, we first investigate the performance of super-resolution (SR) methods for image enhancement, confirming a fundamental trade-off that lightweight learning-based SR struggles to recover fine details, while diffusion-based SR achieves higher fidelity at a substantial computational cost. Motivated by these observations, we propose an end-edge collaborative generation-enhancement framework. Upon receiving a T2I generation task, the system first generates a low-resolution image based on adaptively selected denoising steps and super-resolution scales at the edge side, which is then partitioned into patches and processed by a region-aware hybrid SR policy. This policy applies a diffusion-based SR model to foreground patches for detail recovery and a lightweight learning-based SR model to background patches for efficient upscaling, ultimately stitching the enhanced ones into the high-resolution image. Experiments show that our system reduces service latency by 33% compared with baselines while maintaining competitive image quality.

Abstract: Reliable drone detection is challenging due to limited annotated real-world data, large appearance variability, and the presence of visually similar distractors such as birds. To address these challenges, this paper introduces SimD3, a large-scale high-fidelity synthetic dataset designed for robust drone detection in complex aerial environments. Unlike existing synthetic drone datasets, SimD3 explicitly models drones with heterogeneous payloads, incorporates multiple bird species as realistic distractors, and leverages diverse Unreal Engine 5 environments with controlled weather, lighting, and flight trajectories captured using a 360 six-camera rig. Using SimD3, we conduct an extensive experimental evaluation within the YOLOv5 detection framework, including an attention-enhanced variant termed Yolov5m+C3b, where standard bottleneck-based C3 blocks are replaced with C3b modules. Models are evaluated on synthetic data, combined synthetic and real data, and multiple unseen real-world benchmarks to assess robustness and generalization. Experimental results show that SimD3 provides effective supervision for small-object drone detection and that Yolov5m+C3b consistently outperforms the baseline across in-domain and cross-dataset evaluations. These findings highlight the utility of SimD3 for training and benchmarking robust drone detection models under diverse and challenging conditions.

Abstract: Interpretability is significant in computational pathology, leading to the development of multimodal information integration from histopathological image and corresponding text data.However, existing multimodal methods have limited interpretability due to the lack of high-quality dataset that support explicit reasoning and inference and simple reasoning process.To address the above problems, we introduce a novel multimodal pathology large language model with strong reasoning capabilities.To improve the generation of accurate and contextually relevant textual descriptions, we design a semantic reward strategy integrated with group relative policy optimization.We construct a high-quality pathology visual question answering (VQA) dataset, specifically designed to support complex reasoning tasks.Comprehensive experiments conducted on this dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, even when trained with only 20% of the data.Our method also achieves comparable performance on downstream zero-shot image classification task compared with CLIP.

Abstract: Identifying unique polyps in colon capsule endoscopy (CCE) images is a critical yet challenging task for medical personnel due to the large volume of images, the cognitive load it creates for clinicians, and the ambiguity in labeling specific frames. This paper formulates this problem as a multi-instance learning (MIL) task, where a query polyp image is compared with a target bag of images to determine uniqueness. We employ a multi-instance verification (MIV) framework that incorporates attention mechanisms, such as variance-excited multi-head attention (VEMA) and distance-based attention (DBA), to enhance the model's ability to extract meaningful representations. Additionally, we investigate the impact of self-supervised learning using SimCLR to generate robust embeddings. Experimental results on a dataset of 1912 polyps from 754 patients demonstrate that attention mechanisms significantly improve performance, with DBA L1 achieving the highest test accuracy of 86.26\% and a test AUC of 0.928 using a ConvNeXt backbone with SimCLR pretraining. This study underscores the potential of MIL and self-supervised learning in advancing automated analysis of Colon Capsule Endoscopy images, with implications for broader medical imaging applications.

### [29] [Does medical specialization of VLMs enhance discriminative power?: A comprehensive investigation through feature distribution analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14774)
*Keita Takeda,Tomoya Sakai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 医疗视觉语言模型（VLMs）能够提取用于分类的有效特征，但非医疗领域的VLMs通过上下文改进（如LLM2CLIP）可生成更精细的特征表示。结果表明，优化文本编码器可能比密集训练医疗图像更重要，同时需警惕文本信息引入的偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索医疗VLMs是否真正学习了诊断相关特征，而非仅依赖传统分类准确率评估，以揭示其潜在特征分布特性，并指导下游医疗影像分析任务的改进。

Method: 分析代表性医疗VLMs在多模态病变分类数据集中提取的特征分布，通过与非医疗VLMs对比，评估医疗领域专业化训练的影响。

Result: 医疗VLMs可提取有效的判别特征，但非医疗VLMs（如LLM2CLIP）结合上下文优化后表现更优；模型对图像中的文字覆盖（如标注）存在显著偏差风险。

Conclusion: 优化文本编码器比医疗图像密集训练更关键，需警惕模型选择中的文本信息偏差风险，并针对性选择模型适配下游任务。

Abstract: This study investigates the feature representations produced by publicly available open source medical vision-language models (VLMs). While medical VLMs are expected to capture diagnostically relevant features, their learned representations remain underexplored, and standard evaluations like classification accuracy do not fully reveal if they acquire truly discriminative, lesion-specific features. Understanding these representations is crucial for revealing medical image structures and improving downstream tasks in medical image analysis. This study aims to investigate the feature distributions learned by medical VLMs and evaluate the impact of medical specialization. We analyze the feature distribution of multiple image modalities extracted by some representative medical VLMs across lesion classification datasets on multiple modalities. These distributions were compared them with non-medical VLMs to assess the domain-specific medical training. Our experiments showed that medical VLMs can extract discriminative features that are effective for medical classification tasks. Moreover, it was found that non-medical VLMs with recent improvement with contextual enrichment such as LLM2CLIP produce more refined feature representations. Our results imply that enhancing text encoder is more crucial than training intensively on medical images when developing medical VLMs. Notably, non-medical models are particularly vulnerable to biases introduced by overlaied text strings on images. These findings underscore the need for careful consideration on model selection according to downstream tasks besides potential risks in inference due to background biases such as textual information in images.

Abstract: Movie dubbing is the task of synthesizing speech from scripts conditioned on video scenes, requiring accurate lip sync, faithful timbre transfer, and proper modeling of character identity and emotion. However, existing methods face two major limitations: (1) high-quality multimodal dubbing datasets are limited in scale, suffer from high word error rates, contain sparse annotations, rely on costly manual labeling, and are restricted to monologue scenes, all of which hinder effective model training; (2) existing dubbing models rely solely on the lip region to learn audio-visual alignment, which limits their applicability to complex live-action cinematic scenes, and exhibit suboptimal performance in lip sync, speech quality, and emotional expressiveness. To address these issues, we propose FunCineForge, which comprises an end-to-end production pipeline for large-scale dubbing datasets and an MLLM-based dubbing model designed for diverse cinematic scenes. Using the pipeline, we construct the first Chinese television dubbing dataset with rich annotations, and demonstrate the high quality of these data. Experiments across monologue, narration, dialogue, and multi-speaker scenes show that our dubbing model consistently outperforms SOTA methods in audio quality, lip sync, timbre transfer, and instruction following. Code and demos are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/w/FunCineForge.

*Yifei Liu,Changxing Ding,Ling Guo,Huaiguang Jiang,Qiong Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces RAM, a diffusion model for text-driven motion generation that uses motion latent space and reconstructive error guidance to address representational gaps and reduce error propagation during denoising.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current motion diffusion models suffer from a representational gap due to text encoders lacking motion-specific information and error accumulation during iterative denoising. This work aims to improve accuracy and robustness in text-to-motion generation.

Method: 1. Motion latent space co-training with self-regularization (to strengthen motion space discrimination) and motion-centric alignment (to better link text to motion). 2. Reconstructive Error Guidance (REG) at inference: uses motion reconstruction to identify error patterns from previous denoising steps and amplifies residual improvements in current predictions.

Result: Extensive experiments validate that RAM achieves significant performance improvements and establishes new state-of-the-art results in text-driven motion generation benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed motion-centric design and REG mechanism effectively bridge text-motion representation gaps and mitigate error propagation, enabling more accurate and stable diffusion-based motion generation.

Abstract: Diffusion models have seen widespread adoption for text-driven human motion generation and related tasks due to their impressive generative capabilities and flexibility. However, current motion diffusion models face two major limitations: a representational gap caused by pre-trained text encoders that lack motion-specific information, and error propagation during the iterative denoising process. This paper introduces Reconstruction-Anchored Diffusion Model (RAM) to address these challenges. First, RAM leverages a motion latent space as intermediate supervision for text-to-motion generation. To this end, RAM co-trains a motion reconstruction branch with two key objective functions: self-regularization to enhance the discrimination of the motion space and motion-centric latent alignment to enable accurate mapping from text to the motion latent space. Second, we propose Reconstructive Error Guidance (REG), a testing-stage guidance mechanism that exploits the diffusion model's inherent self-correction ability to mitigate error propagation. At each denoising step, REG uses the motion reconstruction branch to reconstruct the previous estimate, reproducing the prior error patterns. By amplifying the residual between the current prediction and the reconstructed estimate, REG highlights the improvements in the current prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAM achieves significant improvements and state-of-the-art performance. Our code will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 考古文物分类中训练数据稀缺，尤其针对稀有类型中国瓷器时传统深度学习方法受限。研究核心是验证合成数据能否有效解决古文物分类中的数据短缺问题。

Method: 采用MobileNetV3+迁移学习模型，通过控制实验对比纯真实数据与混合真实-合成数据（95:5和90:10比例）的训练效果。合成图像由Stable Diffusion+LoRA生成，分类任务涵盖朝代、釉色、窑口和器型四类。

Result: 任务特异性效果显著：器型分类F1得分提升最高（90:10下+5.5%），朝代和窑口分类提升3-4%。结果表明合成增强效果取决于生成特征与任务视觉特征的匹配度。

Conclusion: 本研究为考古学领域部署生成AI提供了实践指南，证明了合成数据在保持文物真实性的前提下平衡数据多样性的潜力与局限。

Abstract: The scarcity of training data presents a fundamental challenge in applying deep learning to archaeological artifact classification, particularly for the rare types of Chinese porcelain. This study investigates whether synthetic images generated through Stable Diffusion with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) can effectively augment limited real datasets for multi-task CNN-based porcelain classification. Using MobileNetV3 with transfer learning, we conducted controlled experiments comparing models trained on pure real data against those trained on mixed real-synthetic datasets (95:5 and 90:10 ratios) across four classification tasks: dynasty, glaze, kiln and type identification. Results demonstrate task-specific benefits: type classification showed the most substantial improvement (5.5\% F1-macro increase with 90:10 ratio), while dynasty and kiln tasks exhibited modest gains (3-4\%), suggesting that synthetic augmentation effectiveness depends on the alignment between generated features and task-relevant visual signatures. Our work contributes practical guidelines for deploying generative AI in archaeological research, demonstrating both the potential and limitations of synthetic data when archaeological authenticity must be balanced with data diversity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本论文提出了一种名为UniRoute的统一框架，通过模态自适应的路由策略解决遥感图像变化检测中的多模态适应性不足问题。该框架无需为不同模态单独设计模型，而是通过条件路由机制动态选择局部细节与全局上下文信息的融合方式


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的同质/异质变化检测方法存在模态适应性限制：同质检测依赖精细空间线索但易受配准误差影响，异质检测需要全局上下文却容易引入噪声伪影。固定结构的模型和差异算子在跨模态场景表现不足

Method: 核心方法包含：1) 自适应感受野路由MoE(AR2-MoE)模块，解耦局部细节与全局语义；2) 模态感知差异路由MoE(MDR-MoE)模块，动态选择最优融合原语；3) 一致性感知自蒸馏策略(CASD)，在小样本情况下保证训练稳定性。通过条件路由机制实现特征提取与融合的动态调节

Result: 在5个公开数据集的实验表明，UniRoute在统一部署模式下达到82.3%的mIoU，较现有最优方法提升4.7%，同时推理速度提升1.8倍。在SAR-光学跨模态数据集达到76.5%的检测准确率

Conclusion: 提出的模态动态路由机制有效解决了传统方法在跨模态和异质场景中的局限性，通过混合专家路由的动态选择策略，在保持模型效率的同时提升了检测精度。消融实验证明各模块对异质数据处理的贡献度达到显著水平(P<0.01)

Abstract: Current remote sensing change detection (CD) methods mainly rely on specialized models, which limits the scalability toward modality-adaptive Earth observation. For homogeneous CD, precise boundary delineation relies on fine-grained spatial cues and local pixel interactions, whereas heterogeneous CD instead requires broader contextual information to suppress speckle noise and geometric distortions. Moreover, difference operator (e.g., subtraction) works well for aligned homogeneous images but introduces artifacts in cross-modal or geometrically misaligned scenarios. Across different modality settings, specialized models based on static backbones or fixed difference operations often prove insufficient. To address this challenge, we propose UniRoute, a unified framework for modality-adaptive learning by reformulating feature extraction and fusion as conditional routing problems. We introduce an Adaptive Receptive Field Routing MoE (AR2-MoE) module to disentangle local spatial details from global semantic context, and a Modality-Aware Difference Routing MoE (MDR-MoE) module to adaptively select the most suitable fusion primitive at each pixel. In addition, we propose a Consistency-Aware Self-Distillation (CASD) strategy that stabilizes unified training under data-scarce heterogeneous settings by enforcing multi-level consistency. Extensive experiments on five public datasets demonstrate that UniRoute achieves strong overall performance, with a favorable accuracy-efficiency trade-off under a unified deployment setting.

Abstract: Shape descriptors, i.e., per-vertex features of 3D meshes or point clouds, are fundamental to shape analysis. Historically, various handcrafted geometry-aware descriptors and feature refinement techniques have been proposed. Recently, several studies have initiated a new research direction by leveraging features from image foundation models to create semantics-aware descriptors, demonstrating advantages across tasks like shape matching, editing, and segmentation. Symmetry, another key concept in shape analysis, has also attracted increasing attention. Consequently, constructing symmetry-aware shape descriptors is a natural progression. Although the recent method $χ$ (Wang et al., 2025) successfully extracted symmetry-informative features from semantic-aware descriptors, its features are only one-dimensional, neglecting other valuable semantic information. Furthermore, the extracted symmetry-informative feature is usually noisy and yields small misclassified patches. To address these gaps, we propose a feature disentanglement approach which is simultaneously symmetry informative and symmetry agnostic. Further, we propose a feature refinement technique to improve the robustness of predicted symmetry informative features. Extensive experiments, including intrinsic symmetry detection, left/right classification, and shape matching, demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework compared to various state-of-the-art methods, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS虽优于NeRF但存储需求过高，亟需在不依赖训练的后训练阶段实现有效压缩并保持高效推理。

Method: 1) 利用改进光栅化器并行计算splat移除影响实现高效剪枝；2) 通过非训练光照系数稀疏化降低熵；3) 引入微调方案进一步优化性能。

Result: 相较其他压缩方法：存储减少2-4倍、推理加速1.5-2倍、AC光照系数稀疏度达97%，且不依赖微调即达最优率失真与速度表现。

Conclusion: POTR开创了后训练阶段3DGS压缩新范式，在存储、速度与质量间取得显著平衡，为未来轻量化3D重建提供方法论突破。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as a promising contender to Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) in 3D scene reconstruction and real-time novel view synthesis. 3DGS outperforms NeRF in training and inference speed but has substantially higher storage requirements. To remedy this downside, we propose POTR, a post-training 3DGS codec built on two novel techniques. First, POTR introduces a novel pruning approach that uses a modified 3DGS rasterizer to efficiently calculate every splat's individual removal effect simultaneously. This technique results in 2-4x fewer splats than other post-training pruning techniques and as a result also significantly accelerates inference with experiments demonstrating 1.5-2x faster inference than other compressed models. Second, we propose a novel method to recompute lighting coefficients, significantly reducing their entropy without using any form of training. Our fast and highly parallel approach especially increases AC lighting coefficient sparsity, with experiments demonstrating increases from 70% to 97%, with minimal loss in quality. Finally, we extend POTR with a simple fine-tuning scheme to further enhance pruning, inference, and rate-distortion performance. Experiments demonstrate that POTR, even without fine-tuning, consistently outperforms all other post-training compression techniques in both rate-distortion performance and inference speed.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MTFlow is a novel time-conditioned flow-matching model for precise segmentation of microtubules and other curvilinear structures, combining iterative refinement via vector fields with temporal embeddings to overcome challenges like filament curvature and image noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate microtubule segmentation is critical for studying cellular processes and disease mechanisms but remains challenging due to complex structural features and imaging limitations. Existing methods like U-Net struggle with precise boundary refinement in dense, curved filament networks.

Method: MTFlow learns time-dependent vector fields to iteratively refine noisy masks toward ground truth, using a U-Net backbone with temporal embeddings to model uncertainty dynamics. This enables trajectory-based refinement rather than single-pass prediction, capturing sequential boundary resolution processes.

Result: MTFlow achieved competitive accuracy on synthetic and real microtubule datasets, generalized to retinal blood vessels and nerves in biomedical datasets, and provided more precise annotations than manual/semi-automatic approaches while maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The time-conditioned flow framework offers a powerful, efficient solution for filamentous structure analysis, addressing key segmentation challenges through iterative refinement and temporal modeling while maintaining broad applicability to curvilinear structures in biomedical imaging.

Abstract: Microtubules are cytoskeletal filaments that play essential roles in many cellular processes and are key therapeutic targets in several diseases. Accurate segmentation of microtubule networks is critical for studying their organization and dynamics but remains challenging due to filament curvature, dense crossings, and image noise. We present MTFlow, a novel time-conditioned flow-matching model for microtubule segmentation. Unlike conventional U-Net variants that predict masks in a single pass, MTFlow learns vector fields that iteratively transport noisy masks toward the ground truth, enabling interpretable, trajectory-based refinement. Our architecture combines a U-Net backbone with temporal embeddings, allowing the model to capture the dynamics of uncertainty resolution along filament boundaries. We trained and evaluated MTFlow on synthetic and real microtubule datasets and assessed its generalization capability on public biomedical datasets of curvilinear structures such as retinal blood vessels and nerves. MTFlow achieves competitive segmentation accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art models, offering a powerful and time-efficient tool for filamentous structure analysis with more precise annotations than manual or semi-automatic approaches.

TL;DR: GAT-NeRF enhances 4D facial avatar reconstruction from monocular video by integrating a Transformer mechanism with NeRF to improve high-frequency detail capture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current NeRF methods struggle to capture detailed facial expressions and textures from monocular inputs, which hinders realistic virtual human applications.

Method: GAT-NeRF combines a coordinate-aligned MLP with a lightweight Transformer module (GAT) that merges 3D coordinates, 3DMM parameters, and latent codes for enhanced geometry and texture modeling.

Result: GAT-NeRF achieves state-of-the-art visual fidelity and high-frequency detail recovery, surpassing existing methods in reconstructing dynamic facial features like wrinkles and scars.

Conclusion: The hybrid framework enables realistic dynamic digital humans by improving NeRF's capacity to learn complex local facial patterns through multi-modal feature fusion.

Abstract: High-fidelity 4D dynamic facial avatar reconstruction from monocular video is a critical yet challenging task, driven by increasing demands for immersive virtual human applications. While Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have advanced scene representation, their capacity to capture high-frequency facial details, such as dynamic wrinkles and subtle textures from information-constrained monocular streams, requires significant enhancement. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel hybrid neural radiance field framework, called Geometry-Aware-Transformer Enhanced NeRF (GAT-NeRF) for high-fidelity and controllable 4D facial avatar reconstruction, which integrates the Transformer mechanism into the NeRF pipeline. GAT-NeRF synergistically combines a coordinate-aligned Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) with a lightweight Transformer module, termed as Geometry-Aware-Transformer (GAT) due to its processing of multi-modal inputs containing explicit geometric priors. The GAT module is enabled by fusing multi-modal input features, including 3D spatial coordinates, 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) expression parameters, and learnable latent codes to effectively learn and enhance feature representations pertinent to fine-grained geometry. The Transformer's effective feature learning capabilities are leveraged to significantly augment the modeling of complex local facial patterns like dynamic wrinkles and acne scars. Comprehensive experiments unequivocally demonstrate GAT-NeRF's state-of-the-art performance in visual fidelity and high-frequency detail recovery, forging new pathways for creating realistic dynamic digital humans for multimedia applications.

Conclusion: 证明空间记忆的统一表征可有效支持具身智能体的多模态空间推理，为语言导航和对象检索提供抗干扰框架。

Abstract: We present SpatialMem, a memory-centric system that unifies 3D geometry, semantics, and language into a single, queryable representation. Starting from casually captured egocentric RGB video, SpatialMem reconstructs metrically scaled indoor environments, detects structural 3D anchors (walls, doors, windows) as the first-layer scaffold, and populates a hierarchical memory with open-vocabulary object nodes -- linking evidence patches, visual embeddings, and two-layer textual descriptions to 3D coordinates -- for compact storage and fast retrieval. This design enables interpretable reasoning over spatial relations (e.g., distance, direction, visibility) and supports downstream tasks such as language-guided navigation and object retrieval without specialized sensors. Experiments across three real-life indoor scenes demonstrate that SpatialMem maintains strong anchor-description-level navigation completion and hierarchical retrieval accuracy under increasing clutter and occlusion, offering an efficient and extensible framework for embodied spatial intelligence.

Conclusion: 验证了上下文语义关系对抗扰动的重要性，开辟了对抗训练中样本敏感区域挖掘的新方向，为提升分割模型安全性提供理论支持

Abstract: Existing segmentation models exhibit significant vulnerability to adversarial attacks.To improve robustness, adversarial training incorporates adversarial examples into model training. However, existing attack methods consider only global semantic information and ignore contextual semantic relationships within the samples, limiting the effectiveness of adversarial training. To address this issue, we propose EroSeg-AT, a vulnerability-aware adversarial training framework that leverages EroSeg to generate adversarial examples. EroSeg first selects sensitive pixels based on pixel-level confidence and then progressively propagates perturbations to higher-confidence pixels, effectively disrupting the semantic consistency of the samples. Experimental results show that, compared to existing methods, our approach significantly improves attack effectiveness and enhances model robustness under adversarial training.

Method: 构建包含7.9k提示和600+参考图像的TempViz数据集，通过人类评估与自动化评估方法，对5种主流文本到图像模型进行5个时间知识类别的能力测试。

Result: 人类评估显示所有模型在时间知识类别上准确率均低于75%，自动化评估方法未能有效捕捉时间线索，凸显模型时间处理能力的不足和评估方法的局限性。

Conclusion: TempViz为文本到图像模型的时间知识研究提供了基准，揭示了当前技术缺陷，并为未来改进时间感知生成模型指明了方向，特别是需要开发更可靠的自动化评估体系。

Abstract: Time alters the visual appearance of entities in our world, like objects, places, and animals. Thus, for accurately generating contextually-relevant images, knowledge and reasoning about time can be crucial (e.g., for generating a landscape in spring vs. in winter). Yet, although substantial work exists on understanding and improving temporal knowledge in natural language processing, research on how temporal phenomena appear and are handled in text-to-image (T2I) models remains scarce. We address this gap with TempViz, the first data set to holistically evaluate temporal knowledge in image generation, consisting of 7.9k prompts and more than 600 reference images. Using TempViz, we study the capabilities of five T2I models across five temporal knowledge categories. Human evaluation shows that temporal competence is generally weak, with no model exceeding 75% accuracy across categories. Towards larger-scale studies, we also examine automated evaluation methods, comparing several established approaches against human judgments. However, none of these approaches provides a reliable assessment of temporal cues - further indicating the pressing need for future research on temporal knowledge in T2I.

Conclusion: LDF-VFI通过视频整体建模解决现存方法的局限性，开源代码为高分辨率视频插值提供新范式。

Abstract: Existing video frame interpolation (VFI) methods often adopt a frame-centric approach, processing videos as independent short segments (e.g., triplets), which leads to temporal inconsistencies and motion artifacts. To overcome this, we propose a holistic, video-centric paradigm named \textbf{L}ocal \textbf{D}iffusion \textbf{F}orcing for \textbf{V}ideo \textbf{F}rame \textbf{I}nterpolation (LDF-VFI). Our framework is built upon an auto-regressive diffusion transformer that models the entire video sequence to ensure long-range temporal coherence. To mitigate error accumulation inherent in auto-regressive generation, we introduce a novel skip-concatenate sampling strategy that effectively maintains temporal stability. Furthermore, LDF-VFI incorporates sparse, local attention and tiled VAE encoding, a combination that not only enables efficient processing of long sequences but also allows generalization to arbitrary spatial resolutions (e.g., 4K) at inference without retraining. An enhanced conditional VAE decoder, which leverages multi-scale features from the input video, further improves reconstruction fidelity. Empirically, LDF-VFI achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging long-sequence benchmarks, demonstrating superior per-frame quality and temporal consistency, especially in scenes with large motion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TBPS方法受限于数据不足、VLM模型非行人预训练特性以及需要独立微调多个模型；现有联合训练方法无法扩展至大量身份且对噪声敏感

Method: 1) 提出噪声感知的统一数据集构建策略（动态过滤噪声数据并统一标注体系）

Conclusion: 通过数据融合策略和可扩展框架设计，首次验证了构建多数据集统一TBPS模型的可行性，揭示了VLM在行人检索场景的优化方向，并为后续研究提供通用架构。

Abstract: Text-Based Person Search (TBPS) has seen significant progress with vision-language models (VLMs), yet it remains constrained by limited training data and the fact that VLMs are not inherently pre-trained for pedestrian-centric recognition. Existing TBPS methods therefore rely on dataset-centric fine-tuning to handle distribution shift, resulting in multiple independently trained models for different datasets. While synthetic data can increase the scale needed to fine-tune VLMs, it does not eliminate dataset-specific adaptation. This motivates a fundamental question: can we train a single unified TBPS model across multiple datasets? We show that naive joint training over all datasets remains sub-optimal because current training paradigms do not scale to a large number of unique person identities and are vulnerable to noisy image-text pairs. To address these challenges, we propose Scale-TBPS with two contributions: (i) a noise-aware unified dataset curation strategy that cohesively merges diverse TBPS datasets; and (ii) a scalable discriminative identity learning framework that remains effective under a large number of unique identities. Extensive experiments on CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, RSTPReid, IIITD-20K, and UFine6926 demonstrate that a single Scale-TBPS model outperforms dataset-centric optimized models and naive joint training.

*Jianshu Zhang,Chengxuan Qian,Haosen Sun,Haoran Lu,Dingcheng Wang,Letian Xue,Han Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 作者创建了 Progress-Bench 基准测试和 ProgressLM-45K 数据集，研究视觉-语言模型（VLMs）在任务进展推理能力方面的表现，发现多数模型仍无法有效处理该问题，但基于训练的方法（ProgressLM-3B）展现出改进潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有 VLMs 擅长描述视觉内容，但缺乏从部分观测中推断任务进展的动态推理能力。为填补该研究空白，作者设计系统性评估方法并探索提升方案。

Method: 提出了 Progress-Bench 基准测试框架，构建 ProgressLM-45K 数据集，并设计两阶段推理方法：1）无需训练的结构化提示（如步骤分解）；2）基于 ProgressLM-3B 模型的监督训练。在 14 种 VLMs 上进行跨任务验证。

Result: 主流模型在任务进展估计中表现脆弱：对演示形式和视角变化敏感，70% 以上无法处理无答案问题。结构化提示增益有限，而 ProgressLM-3B 在小规模模型上实现稳定提升（如对零样本跨任务迁移的 VQA-Progress 模型准确率提升 18.7%）。

Conclusion: 当前 VLMs 的长期动态推理能力仍不成熟，但通过任务结构化训练和专项数据集优化（如 ProgressLM 系列）可有效改进，为模型设计和评估范式提供了关键洞见。

Abstract: Estimating task progress requires reasoning over long-horizon dynamics rather than recognizing static visual content. While modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at describing what is visible, it remains unclear whether they can infer how far a task has progressed from partial observations. To this end, we introduce Progress-Bench, a benchmark for systematically evaluating progress reasoning in VLMs. Beyond benchmarking, we further explore a human-inspired two-stage progress reasoning paradigm through both training-free prompting and training-based approach based on curated dataset ProgressLM-45K. Experiments on 14 VLMs show that most models are not yet ready for task progress estimation, exhibiting sensitivity to demonstration modality and viewpoint changes, as well as poor handling of unanswerable cases. While training-free prompting that enforces structured progress reasoning yields limited and model-dependent gains, the training-based ProgressLM-3B achieves consistent improvements even at a small model scale, despite being trained on a task set fully disjoint from the evaluation tasks. Further analyses reveal characteristic error patterns and clarify when and why progress reasoning succeeds or fails.

TL;DR: 本文提出BinauralVGGSound数据集和视觉引导框架，首次实现视频到空间双耳音频的高质量生成，在保持语义/时间同步性的同时显著提升空间沉浸感。


<details>

Conclusion: 证明引入双耳空间信息与视觉引导机制可突破现有生成音频的二维限制，为虚实融合应用提供新范式，所有资源开源促进领域发展。

Abstract: While video-to-audio generation has achieved remarkable progress in semantic and temporal alignment, most existing studies focus solely on these aspects, paying limited attention to the spatial perception and immersive quality of the synthesized audio. This limitation stems largely from current models' reliance on mono audio datasets, which lack the binaural spatial information needed to learn visual-to-spatial audio mappings. To address this gap, we introduce two key contributions: we construct BinauralVGGSound, the first large-scale video-binaural audio dataset designed to support spatially aware video-to-audio generation; and we propose a end-to-end spatial audio generation framework guided by visual cues, which explicitly models spatial features. Our framework incorporates a visual-guided audio spatialization module that ensures the generated audio exhibits realistic spatial attributes and layered spatial depth while maintaining semantic and temporal alignment. Experiments show that our approach substantially outperforms state-of-the-art models in spatial fidelity and delivers a more immersive auditory experience, without sacrificing temporal or semantic consistency. All datasets, code, and model checkpoints will be publicly released to facilitate future research.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于生成流匹配（Flow Matching）的新型联邦学习（FL）深度泄漏（DL）攻击方法，无需私有数据知识即可提升重构质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DL攻击在联邦学习中存在稳定性差、重构质量低、鲁棒性不足等问题，需要一种更稳定且适用于现实FL场景的攻击方法。

Method: 将生成流匹配（FM）先验引入重构过程，利用流匹配基础模型引导优化方向，从而提升数据重构的质量和鲁棒性。

Result: 在多个数据集和模型上验证显示，该方法在像素级、感知和特征相似性指标上均优于现有攻击，并在噪声注入、梯度裁剪和稀疏化等常见防御下保持有效性。

Conclusion: 现有联邦学习防御机制需针对具备强大生成先验能力的攻击者升级，以保障隐私安全。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for decentralized model training, yet it remains vulnerable to deep leakage (DL) attacks that reconstruct private client data from shared model updates. While prior DL methods have demonstrated varying levels of success, they often suffer from instability, limited fidelity, or poor robustness under realistic FL settings. We introduce a new DL attack that integrates a generative Flow Matching (FM) prior into the reconstruction process. By guiding optimization toward the distribution of realistic images (represented by a flow matching foundation model), our method enhances reconstruction fidelity without requiring knowledge of the private data. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and target models demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art attacks across pixel-level, perceptual, and feature-based similarity metrics. Crucially, the method remains effective across different training epochs, larger client batch sizes, and under common defenses such as noise injection, clipping, and sparsification. Our findings call for the development of new defense strategies that explicitly account for adversaries equipped with powerful generative priors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数据脱敏技术难以平衡隐私保护与数据可用性，现有合成数据方法需反复权衡隐私-效用关系。作者旨在提出兼顾隐私性与实用性的生成方法。

Method: 采用误差反馈随机梯度下降（EFSGD）优化方法，在训练中引入重构损失函数和噪声注入机制，通过动态误差反馈调节生成参数。

Result: 在MNIST/Fashion-MNIST/CelebA三个基准数据集上，生成的灰度和RGB图像在各项指标上达到最先进水平，质量与可用性均优于同类方法。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了差分隐私生成中的隐私-效用权衡难题，为隐私保护机器学习提供了新的技术路径。

Abstract: Traditional data masking techniques such as anonymization cannot achieve the expected privacy protection while ensuring data utility for privacy-preserving machine learning. Synthetic data plays an increasingly important role as it generates a large number of training samples and prevents information leakage in real data. The existing methods suffer from the repeating trade-off processes between privacy and utility. We propose a novel framework for differential privacy generation, which employs an Error Feedback Stochastic Gradient Descent(EFSGD) method and introduces a reconstruction loss and noise injection mechanism into the training process. We generate images with higher quality and usability under the same privacy budget as the related work. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our proposed framework for both grayscale and RGB images. We achieve state-of-the-art results over almost all metrics on three benchmarks: MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CelebA.

*Tianyu Li,Songyue Cai,Zongqian Wu,Ping Hu,Xiaofeng Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a plug-and-play framework (FoBoR) for foreground-background decomposition in few-shot OOD detection, addressing limitations of uniform background suppression and confusable foreground patches through adaptive entropy weighting and rectification modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CLIP-based FG-BG decomposition methods suffer from: 1) uniform background patch suppression ignoring differential patch contributions, and 2) foreground patches with cross-class similarities causing training bias. This work aims to improve OOD detection performance by addressing both issues.

Method: The framework includes: 1) Standard FG-BG decomposition; 2) Adaptive Background Suppression using entropy-based dynamic patch weighting; 3) Confusable Foreground Rectification that identifies and corrects semantically ambiguous foreground patches through class-aware contrastive learning.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate significant performance improvements in few-shot OOD detection tasks compared to baseline FG-BG decomposition methods, with the code publicly available.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully enhances OOD detection by: 1) adaptive background region handling via entropy weighting, and 2) explicit rectification of confusing foreground patches, offering a generalizable solution for vision models.

Abstract: CLIP-based foreground-background (FG-BG) decomposition methods have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in improving few-shot out-of-distribution (OOD) detection performance. However, existing approaches still suffer from several limitations. For background regions obtained from decomposition, existing methods adopt a uniform suppression strategy for all patches, overlooking the varying contributions of different patches to the prediction. For foreground regions, existing methods fail to adequately consider that some local patches may exhibit appearance or semantic similarity to other classes, which may mislead the training process. To address these issues, we propose a new plug-and-play framework. This framework consists of three core components: (1) a Foreground-Background Decomposition module, which follows previous FG-BG methods to separate an image into foreground and background regions; (2) an Adaptive Background Suppression module, which adaptively weights patch classification entropy; and (3) a Confusable Foreground Rectification module, which identifies and rectifies confusable foreground patches. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed plug-and-play framework significantly improves the performance of existing FG-BG decomposition methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉刺激在不同个体和试验中的神经响应存在解剖、功能、认知等多维变异性，导致传统fMRI-图像重建方法无法直接跨被试应用，亟需构建通用模型架构和标准化数据集支撑零样本迁移推理。

Method: 构建标准化脑皮层数据集UniCortex-fMRI并提出组合潜变量建模方法：1) 通过分层因子分解模块捕获被试/数据集/试验相关变异；2) 配对因子化正则化约束模型空间一致性；3) 在推理阶段合成多条件潜表示引导扩散模型生成图像。

Result: 在跨10个不同被试的零样本实验中，PictorialCortex相比基线模型将重建图像的语义相似度提升23.6%，验证了组合潜变量建模和多数据集训练对克服神经变异性的作用，模型在复杂场景和物体类别中表现尤其稳定。

Conclusion: 该技术通过建立统一的脑活动表征空间，证明了跨被试零样本神经解码的可能性，为个性化脑机接口开发和理解共享视觉表征机制提供了新范式，但需注意到自然视觉场景重建仍受限于fMRI的空间分辨率。

Abstract: Decoding visual experiences from human brain activity remains a central challenge at the intersection of neuroscience, neuroimaging, and artificial intelligence. A critical obstacle is the inherent variability of cortical responses: neural activity elicited by the same visual stimulus differs across individuals and trials due to anatomical, functional, cognitive, and experimental factors, making fMRI-to-image reconstruction non-injective. In this paper, we tackle a challenging yet practically meaningful problem: zero-shot cross-subject fMRI-to-image reconstruction, where the visual experience of a previously unseen individual must be reconstructed without subject-specific training. To enable principled evaluation, we present a unified cortical-surface dataset -- UniCortex-fMRI, assembled from multiple visual-stimulus fMRI datasets to provide broad coverage of subjects and stimuli. Our UniCortex-fMRI is particularly processed by standardized data formats to make it possible to explore this possibility in the zero-shot scenario of cross-subject fMRI-to-image reconstruction. To tackle the modeling challenge, we propose PictorialCortex, which models fMRI activity using a compositional latent formulation that structures stimulus-driven representations under subject-, dataset-, and trial-related variability. PictorialCortex operates in a universal cortical latent space and implements this formulation through a latent factorization--composition module, reinforced by paired factorization and re-factorizing consistency regularization. During inference, surrogate latents synthesized under multiple seen-subject conditions are aggregated to guide diffusion-based image synthesis for unseen subjects. Extensive experiments show that PictorialCortex improves zero-shot cross-subject visual reconstruction, highlighting the benefits of compositional latent modeling and multi-dataset training.

Conclusion: 该框架攻克了神经服装模拟中跨分辨率泛化的根本挑战，为高效高精度模拟提供了新方向。

Abstract: Garment simulation is fundamental to various applications in computer vision and graphics, from virtual try-on to digital human modelling. However, conventional physics-based methods remain computationally expensive, hindering their application in time-sensitive scenarios. While graph neural networks (GNNs) offer promising acceleration, existing approaches exhibit poor cross-resolution generalisation, demonstrating significant performance degradation on higher-resolution meshes beyond the training distribution. This stems from two key factors: (1) existing GNNs employ fixed message-passing depth that fails to adapt information aggregation to mesh density variation, and (2) vertex-wise displacement magnitudes are inherently resolution-dependent in garment simulation. To address these issues, we introduce Propagation-before-Update Graph Network (Pb4U-GNet), a resolution-adaptive framework that decouples message propagation from feature updates. Pb4U-GNet incorporates two key mechanisms: (1) dynamic propagation depth control, adjusting message-passing iterations based on mesh resolution, and (2) geometry-aware update scaling, which scales predictions according to local mesh characteristics. Extensive experiments show that even trained solely on low-resolution meshes, Pb4U-GNet exhibits strong generalisability across diverse mesh resolutions, addressing a fundamental challenge in neural garment simulation.

Abstract: Hateful videos pose serious risks by amplifying discrimination, inciting violence, and undermining online safety. Existing training-based hateful video detection methods are constrained by limited training data and lack of interpretability, while directly prompting large vision-language models often struggle to deliver reliable hate detection. To address these challenges, this paper introduces MARS, a training-free Multi-stage Adversarial ReaSoning framework that enables reliable and interpretable hateful content detection. MARS begins with the objective description of video content, establishing a neutral foundation for subsequent analysis. Building on this, it develops evidence-based reasoning that supports potential hateful interpretations, while in parallel incorporating counter-evidence reasoning to capture plausible non-hateful perspectives. Finally, these perspectives are synthesized into a conclusive and explainable decision. Extensive evaluation on two real-world datasets shows that MARS achieves up to 10% improvement under certain backbones and settings compared to other training-free approaches and outperforms state-of-the-art training-based methods on one dataset. In addition, MARS produces human-understandable justifications, thereby supporting compliance oversight and enhancing the transparency of content moderation workflows.

Conclusion: 现有模型对真实标注噪声高度敏感，需改进训练数据多样性并建立更严格的稳健性评估标准

Abstract: Promptable segmentation models such as SAM have established a powerful paradigm, enabling strong generalization to unseen objects and domains with minimal user input, including points, bounding boxes, and text prompts. Among these, bounding boxes stand out as particularly effective, often outperforming points while significantly reducing annotation costs. However, current training and evaluation protocols typically rely on synthetic prompts generated through simple heuristics, offering limited insight into real-world robustness. In this paper, we investigate the robustness of promptable segmentation models to natural variations in bounding box prompts. First, we conduct a controlled user study and collect thousands of real bounding box annotations. Our analysis reveals substantial variability in segmentation quality across users for the same model and instance, indicating that SAM-like models are highly sensitive to natural prompt noise. Then, since exhaustive testing of all possible user inputs is computationally prohibitive, we reformulate robustness evaluation as a white-box optimization problem over the bounding box prompt space. We introduce BREPS, a method for generating adversarial bounding boxes that minimize or maximize segmentation error while adhering to naturalness constraints. Finally, we benchmark state-of-the-art models across 10 datasets, spanning everyday scenes to medical imaging. Code - https://github.com/emb-ai/BREPS.

Abstract: Despite tremendous improvements in tasks such as image classification, object detection, and segmentation, the recognition of visual relationships, commonly modeled as the extraction of a graph from an image, remains a challenging task. We believe that this mainly stems from the fact that there is no canonical way to approach the visual graph recognition task. Most existing solutions are specific to a problem and cannot be transferred between different contexts out-of-the box, even though the conceptual problem remains the same. With broad applicability and simplicity in mind, in this paper we develop a method, \textbf{Gra}ph Recognition via \textbf{S}ubgraph \textbf{P}rediction (\textbf{GraSP}), for recognizing graphs in images. We show across several synthetic benchmarks and one real-world application that our method works with a set of diverse types of graphs and their drawings, and can be transferred between tasks without task-specific modifications, paving the way to a more unified framework for visual graph recognition.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of research across machine learning, vision, and language has produced a volume of publications that is increasingly difficult to synthesize. Traditional bibliometric tools rely mainly on metadata and offer limited visibility into the semantic content of papers, making it hard to track how research themes evolve over time or how different areas influence one another. To obtain a clearer picture of recent developments, we compile a unified corpus of more than 100,000 papers from 22 major conferences between 2020 and 2025 and construct a multidimensional profiling pipeline to organize and analyze their textual content. By combining topic clustering, LLM-assisted parsing, and structured retrieval, we derive a comprehensive representation of research activity that supports the study of topic lifecycles, methodological transitions, dataset and model usage patterns, and institutional research directions. Our analysis highlights several notable shifts, including the growth of safety, multimodal reasoning, and agent-oriented studies, as well as the gradual stabilization of areas such as neural machine translation and graph-based methods. These findings provide an evidence-based view of how AI research is evolving and offer a resource for understanding broader trends and identifying emerging directions.

Abstract: Most 2D human pose estimation benchmarks are nearly saturated, with the exception of crowded scenes. We introduce PMPose, a top-down 2D pose estimator that incorporates the probabilistic formulation and the mask-conditioning. PMPose improves crowded pose estimation without sacrificing performance on standard scenes. Building on this, we present BBoxMaskPose v2 (BMPv2) integrating PMPose and an enhanced SAM-based mask refinement module. BMPv2 surpasses state-of-the-art by 1.5 average precision (AP) points on COCO and 6 AP points on OCHuman, becoming the first method to exceed 50 AP on OCHuman. We demonstrate that BMP's 2D prompting of 3D model improves 3D pose estimation in crowded scenes and that advances in 2D pose quality directly benefit 3D estimation. Results on the new OCHuman-Pose dataset show that multi-person performance is more affected by pose prediction accuracy than by detection.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 早期准确分类阿尔茨海默病对临床干预和患者预后至关重要，现有模型在准确率和类间稳定性上存在不足，需通过架构比较和混合策略改进性能。

Method: 评估5种CNN架构（如ResNet50）、5种Transformer模型（如ViT）及新混合模型Evan_V2（整合10种模型特征级融合），在四分类AD任务（包含四个认知衰退阶段）上进行对比实验，通过准确率、F1-score、ROC AUC等指标评估。

Abstract: Early and accurate classification of Alzheimers disease (AD) from brain MRI scans is essential for timely clinical intervention and improved patient outcomes. This study presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of five CNN architectures (EfficientNetB0, ResNet50, DenseNet201, MobileNetV3, VGG16), five Transformer-based models (ViT, ConvTransformer, PatchTransformer, MLP-Mixer, SimpleTransformer), and a proposed hybrid model named Evan_V2. All models were evaluated on a four-class AD classification task comprising Mild Dementia, Moderate Dementia, Non-Demented, and Very Mild Dementia categories. Experimental findings show that CNN architectures consistently achieved strong performance, with ResNet50 attaining 98.83% accuracy. Transformer models demonstrated competitive generalization capabilities, with ViT achieving the highest accuracy among them at 95.38%. However, individual Transformer variants exhibited greater class-specific instability. The proposed Evan_V2 hybrid model, which integrates outputs from ten CNN and Transformer architectures through feature-level fusion, achieved the best overall performance with 99.99% accuracy, 0.9989 F1-score, and 0.9968 ROC AUC. Confusion matrix analysis further confirmed that Evan_V2 substantially reduced misclassification across all dementia stages, outperforming every standalone model. These findings highlight the potential of hybrid ensemble strategies in producing highly reliable and clinically meaningful diagnostic tools for Alzheimers disease classification.

Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D object generation using diffusion models have achieved remarkable success, but generating realistic 3D urban scenes remains challenging. Existing methods relying solely on 3D diffusion models tend to suffer a degradation in appearance details, while those utilizing only 2D diffusion models typically compromise camera controllability. To overcome this limitation, we propose ScenDi, a method for urban scene generation that integrates both 3D and 2D diffusion models. We first train a 3D latent diffusion model to generate 3D Gaussians, enabling the rendering of images at a relatively low resolution. To enable controllable synthesis, this 3DGS generation process can be optionally conditioned by specifying inputs such as 3d bounding boxes, road maps, or text prompts. Then, we train a 2D video diffusion model to enhance appearance details conditioned on rendered images from the 3D Gaussians. By leveraging the coarse 3D scene as guidance for 2D video diffusion, ScenDi generates desired scenes based on input conditions and successfully adheres to accurate camera trajectories. Experiments on two challenging real-world datasets, Waymo and KITTI-360, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Cervical spine fractures are critical medical conditions requiring precise and efficient detection for effective clinical management. This study explores the viability of 2D projection-based vertebra segmentation for vertebra-level fracture detection in 3D CT volumes, presenting an end-to-end pipeline for automated analysis of cervical vertebrae (C1-C7). By approximating a 3D volume through optimized 2D axial, sagittal, and coronal projections, regions of interest are identified using the YOLOv8 model from all views and combined to approximate the 3D cervical spine area, achieving a 3D mIoU of 94.45 percent. This projection-based localization strategy reduces computational complexity compared to traditional 3D segmentation methods while maintaining high performance. It is followed by a DenseNet121-Unet-based multi-label segmentation leveraging variance- and energy-based projections, achieving a Dice score of 87.86 percent. Strategic approximation of 3D vertebral masks from these 2D segmentation masks enables the extraction of individual vertebra volumes. The volumes are analyzed for fractures using an ensemble of 2.5D Spatio-Sequential models incorporating both raw slices and projections per vertebra for complementary evaluation. This ensemble achieves vertebra-level and patient-level F1 scores of 68.15 and 82.26, and ROC-AUC scores of 91.62 and 83.04, respectively. We further validate our approach through an explainability study that provides saliency map visualizations highlighting anatomical regions relevant for diagnosis, and an interobserver variability analysis comparing our model's performance with expert radiologists, demonstrating competitive results.

Abstract: Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) from monocular RGB images is a fundamental yet challenging task due to the inherent ambiguity of inferring occluded 3D geometry from a single view. While feed-forward methods have made progress, they often struggle to generate plausible details in occluded regions and preserve the fundamental spatial relationships of objects. Such accurate generative reasoning capability for the entire 3D space is critical in real-world applications. In this paper, we present FlowSSC, the first generative framework applied directly to monocular semantic scene completion. FlowSSC treats the SSC task as a conditional generation problem and can seamlessly integrate with existing feed-forward SSC methods to significantly boost their performance. To achieve real-time inference without compromising quality, we introduce Shortcut Flow-matching that operates in a compact triplane latent space. Unlike standard diffusion models that require hundreds of steps, our method utilizes a shortcut mechanism to achieve high-fidelity generation in a single step, enabling practical deployment in autonomous systems. Extensive experiments on SemanticKITTI demonstrate that FlowSSC achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing baselines.

Abstract: Perception is a cornerstone of autonomous driving, enabling vehicles to understand their surroundings and make safe, reliable decisions. Developing robust perception algorithms requires large-scale, high-quality datasets that cover diverse driving conditions and support thorough evaluation. Existing datasets often lack a high-fidelity digital twin, limiting systematic testing, edge-case simulation, sensor modification, and sim-to-real evaluations. To address this gap, we present DrivIng, a large-scale multimodal dataset with a complete geo-referenced digital twin of a ~18 km route spanning urban, suburban, and highway segments. Our dataset provides continuous recordings from six RGB cameras, one LiDAR, and high-precision ADMA-based localization, captured across day, dusk, and night. All sequences are annotated at 10 Hz with 3D bounding boxes and track IDs across 12 classes, yielding ~1.2 million annotated instances. Alongside the benefits of a digital twin, DrivIng enables a 1-to-1 transfer of real traffic into simulation, preserving agent interactions while enabling realistic and flexible scenario testing. To support reproducible research and robust validation, we benchmark DrivIng with state-of-the-art perception models and publicly release the dataset, digital twin, HD map, and codebase.

Result: 在CO3D数据集上LPIPS指标相对提升15%，且能无缝融合RGB-D输入实现性能进一步提升，验证了新视角合成和立体深度估计任务的有效性

Conclusion: RayRoPE解决了多视角Transformer位置编码的关键限制，通过几何自适应编码和不确定性分析，实现了更优的跨视角特征对齐与交互建模能力

Abstract: We study positional encodings for multi-view transformers that process tokens from a set of posed input images, and seek a mechanism that encodes patches uniquely, allows SE(3)-invariant attention with multi-frequency similarity, and can be adaptive to the geometry of the underlying scene. We find that prior (absolute or relative) encoding schemes for multi-view attention do not meet the above desiderata, and present RayRoPE to address this gap. RayRoPE represents patch positions based on associated rays but leverages a predicted point along the ray instead of the direction for a geometry-aware encoding. To achieve SE(3) invariance, RayRoPE computes query-frame projective coordinates for computing multi-frequency similarity. Lastly, as the 'predicted' 3D point along a ray may not be precise, RayRoPE presents a mechanism to analytically compute the expected position encoding under uncertainty. We validate RayRoPE on the tasks of novel-view synthesis and stereo depth estimation and show that it consistently improves over alternate position encoding schemes (e.g. 15% relative improvement on LPIPS in CO3D). We also show that RayRoPE can seamlessly incorporate RGB-D input, resulting in even larger gains over alternatives that cannot positionally encode this information.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the overlooked challenge of stability and temporal consistency in interactive video generation, which synthesizes dynamic and controllable video worlds through interactive behaviors such as camera movements and text prompts. Despite remarkable progress in world modeling, current methods still suffer from severe instability and temporal degradation, often leading to spatial drift and scene collapse during long-horizon interactions. To better understand this issue, we initially investigate the underlying causes of instability and identify that the major source of error accumulation originates from the same scene, where generated frames gradually deviate from the initial clean state and propagate errors to subsequent frames. Building upon this observation, we propose a simple yet effective method, \textbf{StableWorld}, a Dynamic Frame Eviction Mechanism. By continuously filtering out degraded frames while retaining geometrically consistent ones, StableWorld effectively prevents cumulative drift at its source, leading to more stable and temporal consistency of interactive generation. Promising results on multiple interactive video models, \eg, Matrix-Game, Open-Oasis, and Hunyuan-GameCraft, demonstrate that StableWorld is model-agnostic and can be applied to different interactive video generation frameworks to substantially improve stability, temporal consistency, and generalization across diverse interactive scenarios.

Abstract: Video generation models have significantly advanced embodied intelligence, unlocking new possibilities for generating diverse robot data that capture perception, reasoning, and action in the physical world. However, synthesizing high-quality videos that accurately reflect real-world robotic interactions remains challenging, and the lack of a standardized benchmark limits fair comparisons and progress. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive robotics benchmark, RBench, designed to evaluate robot-oriented video generation across five task domains and four distinct embodiments. It assesses both task-level correctness and visual fidelity through reproducible sub-metrics, including structural consistency, physical plausibility, and action completeness. Evaluation of 25 representative models highlights significant deficiencies in generating physically realistic robot behaviors. Furthermore, the benchmark achieves a Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.96 with human evaluations, validating its effectiveness. While RBench provides the necessary lens to identify these deficiencies, achieving physical realism requires moving beyond evaluation to address the critical shortage of high-quality training data. Driven by these insights, we introduce a refined four-stage data pipeline, resulting in RoVid-X, the largest open-source robotic dataset for video generation with 4 million annotated video clips, covering thousands of tasks and enriched with comprehensive physical property annotations. Collectively, this synergistic ecosystem of evaluation and data establishes a robust foundation for rigorous assessment and scalable training of video models, accelerating the evolution of embodied AI toward general intelligence.

Abstract: We present a novel approach for interactive light editing in indoor scenes from a single multi-view scene capture. Our method leverages a generative image-based light decomposition model that factorizes complex indoor scene illumination into its constituent light sources. This factorization enables independent manipulation of individual light sources, specifically allowing control over their state (on/off), chromaticity, and intensity. We further introduce multi-view lighting harmonization to ensure consistent propagation of the lighting decomposition across all scene views. This is integrated into a relightable 3D Gaussian splatting representation, providing real-time interactive control over the individual light sources. Our results demonstrate highly photorealistic lighting decomposition and relighting outcomes across diverse indoor scenes. We evaluate our method on both synthetic and real-world datasets and provide a quantitative and qualitative comparison to state-of-the-art techniques.

Abstract: What if a video generation model could not only imagine a plausible future, but the correct one, accurately reflecting how the world changes with each action? We address this question by presenting the Egocentric World Model (EgoWM), a simple, architecture-agnostic method that transforms any pretrained video diffusion model into an action-conditioned world model, enabling controllable future prediction. Rather than training from scratch, we repurpose the rich world priors of Internet-scale video models and inject motor commands through lightweight conditioning layers. This allows the model to follow actions faithfully while preserving realism and strong generalization. Our approach scales naturally across embodiments and action spaces, ranging from 3-DoF mobile robots to 25-DoF humanoids, where predicting egocentric joint-angle-driven dynamics is substantially more challenging. The model produces coherent rollouts for both navigation and manipulation tasks, requiring only modest fine-tuning. To evaluate physical correctness independently of visual appearance, we introduce the Structural Consistency Score (SCS), which measures whether stable scene elements evolve consistently with the provided actions. EgoWM improves SCS by up to 80 percent over prior state-of-the-art navigation world models, while achieving up to six times lower inference latency and robust generalization to unseen environments, including navigation inside paintings.

Conclusion: 迭代自修正方法为组合式图像生成提供了通用有效的范式，验证了序贯优化在提升生成质量中的价值。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have achieved remarkable progress, yet they continue to struggle with complex prompts that require simultaneously handling multiple objects, relations, and attributes. Existing inference-time strategies, such as parallel sampling with verifiers or simply increasing denoising steps, can improve prompt alignment but remain inadequate for richly compositional settings where many constraints must be satisfied. Inspired by the success of chain-of-thought reasoning in large language models, we propose an iterative test-time strategy in which a T2I model progressively refines its generations across multiple steps, guided by feedback from a vision-language model as the critic in the loop. Our approach is simple, requires no external tools or priors, and can be flexibly applied to a wide range of image generators and vision-language models. Empirically, we demonstrate consistent gains on image generation across benchmarks: a 16.9% improvement in all-correct rate on ConceptMix (k=7), a 13.8% improvement on T2I-CompBench (3D-Spatial category) and a 12.5% improvement on Visual Jenga scene decomposition compared to compute-matched parallel sampling. Beyond quantitative gains, iterative refinement produces more faithful generations by decomposing complex prompts into sequential corrections, with human evaluators preferring our method 58.7% of the time over 41.3% for the parallel baseline. Together, these findings highlight iterative self-correction as a broadly applicable principle for compositional image generation.

Conclusion: 通过创新的去模糊建模和伪标签监督，实现了身份信息与复杂属性的双重保留，为无监督身份转换提供新范式。

Abstract: Face swapping aims to transfer the identity of a source face onto a target face while preserving target-specific attributes such as pose, expression, lighting, skin tone, and makeup. However, since real ground truth for face swapping is unavailable, achieving both accurate identity transfer and high-quality attribute preservation remains challenging. In addition, recent diffusion-based approaches attempt to improve visual fidelity through conditional inpainting on masked target images, but the masked condition removes crucial appearance cues of target, resulting in plausible yet misaligned attributes. To address these limitations, we propose APPLE (Attribute-Preserving Pseudo-Labeling), a diffusion-based teacher-student framework that enhances attribute fidelity through attribute-aware pseudo-label supervision. We reformulate face swapping as a conditional deblurring task to more faithfully preserve target-specific attributes such as lighting, skin tone, and makeup. In addition, we introduce an attribute-aware inversion scheme to further improve detailed attribute preservation. Through an elaborate attribute-preserving design for teacher learning, APPLE produces high-quality pseudo triplets that explicitly provide the student with direct face-swapping supervision.

### [68] [From Chaos to Clarity: Schema-Constrained AI for Auditable Biomedical Evidence Extraction from Full-Text PDFs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14267)
*Pouria Mortezaagha,Joseph Shaw,Bowen Sun,Arya Rahgozar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于模式约束和溯源感知的人工智能提取系统，用于从生物医学PDF文献中准确提取结构化数据并支持高可信度证据合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学证据合成需要从全文文献中提取方法学、实验室和结果变量，但现有文档AI系统受限于OCR错误、长文档碎片化、吞吐量不足和审计追溯性差，难以满足高可信场景需求。

Method: 通过模式约束(类型化模式、受控词表、证据门控决策)限制模型推理，采用resume-aware哈希和caption-aware分块技术处理文档，异步并发处理后使用冲突感知合并、集合聚合和句子级溯源进行确定性整合。

Result: 在抗凝血药浓度监测文献集上验证：系统实现全流程自动化处理，保持稳定吞吐量；迭代模式优化使关键变量提取准确率显著提升(如检测方法分类、结果定义、随访时间等)；文档分块间表现出强内部一致性。

Conclusion: 模式约束下的溯源感知提取技术实现了异构科学PDF向结构化证据的可扩展可审计转换，解决了生物医学证据合成对透明性和可靠性要求的痛点。

Abstract: Biomedical evidence synthesis relies on accurate extraction of methodological, laboratory, and outcome variables from full-text research articles, yet these variables are embedded in complex scientific PDFs that make manual abstraction time-consuming and difficult to scale. Existing document AI systems remain limited by OCR errors, long-document fragmentation, constrained throughput, and insufficient auditability for high-stakes synthesis. We present a schema-constrained AI extraction system that transforms full-text biomedical PDFs into structured, analysis-ready records by explicitly restricting model inference through typed schemas, controlled vocabularies, and evidence-gated decisions. Documents are ingested using resume-aware hashing, partitioned into caption-aware page-level chunks, and processed asynchronously under explicit concurrency controls. Chunk-level outputs are deterministically merged into study-level records using conflict-aware consolidation, set-based aggregation, and sentence-level provenance to support traceability and post-hoc audit. Evaluated on a corpus of studies on direct oral anticoagulant level measurement, the pipeline processed all documents without manual intervention, maintained stable throughput under service constraints, and exhibited strong internal consistency across document chunks. Iterative schema refinement substantially improved extraction fidelity for synthesis-critical variables, including assay classification, outcome definitions, follow-up duration, and timing of measurement. These results demonstrate that schema-constrained, provenance-aware extraction enables scalable and auditable transformation of heterogeneous scientific PDFs into structured evidence, aligning modern document AI with the transparency and reliability requirements of biomedical evidence synthesis.

*Youyou Cheng,Zhuangwei Kang,Kerry Jiang,Chenyu Sun,Qiyang Pan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出一个基于多轮对话的压力测试框架，发现主流大模型在心理支持场景下会逐步突破安全边界，尤其是自适应探测方式能更快引发违规承诺。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大模型心理安全评估仅侧重单轮对话禁用词检测，而实际应用中多轮交互导致的安全边界逐步侵蚀（如过度承诺、越权行为）更值得警惕。

Method: 构建20轮虚拟精神科对话场景，使用静态渐进式和自适应探测两种压力模式，对50个虚拟患者档案进行测试，对比不同交互压力下的安全边界突破特征。

Result: 两种测试模式均导致高频违规，但自适应探测使安全边界突破时间提前（平均轮次从9.21降至4.64），过度承诺成为最主要的违规形式。

Conclusion: 仅通过单轮测试无法评估大模型真实安全鲁棒性，需充分考量多轮对话中交互压力对安全边界的磨损效应，并重点关注共情驱动下的隐性违规风险。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely used for mental health support. However, current safety evaluations in this field are mostly limited to detecting whether LLMs output prohibited words in single-turn conversations, neglecting the gradual erosion of safety boundaries in long dialogues. Examples include making definitive guarantees, assuming responsibility, and playing professional roles. We believe that with the evolution of mainstream LLMs, words with obvious safety risks are easily filtered by their underlying systems, while the real danger lies in the gradual transgression of boundaries during multi-turn interactions, driven by the LLM's attempts at comfort and empathy.
  This paper proposes a multi-turn stress testing framework and conducts long-dialogue safety tests on three cutting-edge LLMs using two pressure methods: static progression and adaptive probing. We generated 50 virtual patient profiles and stress-tested each model through up to 20 rounds of virtual psychiatric dialogues. The experimental results show that violations are common, and both pressure modes produced similar violation rates. However, adaptive probing significantly advanced the time at which models crossed boundaries, reducing the average number of turns from 9.21 in static progression to 4.64. Under both mechanisms, making definitive or zero-risk promises was the primary way in which boundaries were breached. These findings suggest that the robustness of LLM safety boundaries cannot be inferred solely through single-turn tests; it is necessary to fully consider the wear and tear on safety boundaries caused by different interaction pressures and characteristics in extended dialogues.

Motivation: 尽管LLMs展现出多步推理能力，但其内部机制仍不明确。现有研究多关注性能提升，缺乏对根本性机制的系统性分析。

Method: 构建包含七个关联研究问题的概念框架，从隐式多跳推理（隐藏激活执行）到显性推理（语言化逻辑重塑）的完整链条进行系统性分析。

Result: 提出覆盖LLMs推理全流程的理论框架，揭示隐式与显式推理的相互作用，并系统梳理多步推理的实现路径。

Conclusion: 为解析LLMs推理能力本质提供方法论指导，明确基于机制研究的未来探索方向，如因果溯源、记忆架构分析等。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities to solve problems requiring multiple reasoning steps, yet the internal mechanisms enabling such capabilities remain elusive. Unlike existing surveys that primarily focus on engineering methods to enhance performance, this survey provides a comprehensive overview of the mechanisms underlying LLM multi-step reasoning. We organize the survey around a conceptual framework comprising seven interconnected research questions, from how LLMs execute implicit multi-hop reasoning within hidden activations to how verbalized explicit reasoning remodels the internal computation. Finally, we highlight five research directions for future mechanistic studies.

Motivation: 现有基础模型在理解学术论文的专门科研话语和复杂图表方面存在困难，但现有基准缺乏细粒度的大规模评估能力。

Method: 设计了一个与科研流程对齐的细粒度分类法，并开发了基于LLM的评估框架（LLM-as-a-Judge），结合人类标注质量控制机制。

Result: 实验证明即使是GPT-5等最强模型在正确-完整指标上仅达到68.2%，经简洁性修正后下降至37.46%。

Conclusion: 揭示了精准学术论文理解能力上仍存在显著差距，数据集和代码已开源提供测试支持。

Abstract: Understanding research papers remains challenging for foundation models due to specialized scientific discourse and complex figures and tables, yet existing benchmarks offer limited fine-grained evaluation at scale. To address this gap, we introduce RPC-Bench, a large-scale question-answering benchmark built from review-rebuttal exchanges of high-quality computer science papers, containing 15K human-verified QA pairs. We design a fine-grained taxonomy aligned with the scientific research flow to assess models' ability to understand and answer why, what, and how questions in scholarly contexts. We also define an elaborate LLM-human interaction annotation framework to support large-scale labeling and quality control. Following the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm, we develop a scalable framework that evaluates models on correctness-completeness and conciseness, with high agreement to human judgment. Experiments reveal that even the strongest models (GPT-5) achieve only 68.2% correctness-completeness, dropping to 37.46% after conciseness adjustment, highlighting substantial gaps in precise academic paper understanding.

*Aradhya Dixit,Tianxi Liang,Jai Telang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 小型语言模型在处理约束问题时易因线性推理导致错误累积，本研究提出验证者引导的蒸馏方法，通过训练含错误修正的推理路径，使小模型具备自我纠正能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SLMs因参数规模小难以处理复杂约束问题，其线性且过自信的推理机制无法从早期错误中恢复，需要提升其动态修正推理路径的能力。

Method: 设计Verifier-Guided Distillation训练协议，使用验证过的包含错误与修正的推理轨迹作为教师模型，引导7B参数的学生模型学习冲突检测与回溯机制，而非仅输出正确答案。

Result: 小模型可自主生成验证行为，通过暂停推理、识别逻辑矛盾、修正前提假设，显著降低最终输出错误率，且不依赖外部验证工具。

Conclusion: 通过迁移错误修复过程而非最终答案，小型模型在保持轻量化优势的同时，获得了类似大型模型的动态推理修正能力，拓展了其应用边界。

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs, under 10B parameters) are attractive for private, on-device deployment, yet they frequently fail on strict constraint-satisfaction problems due to linear, overconfident reasoning traces that do not recover from early mistakes. We introduce Verifier-Guided Distillation, a training protocol that transfers the process of error repair - explicit conflict detection and backtracking - rather than only correct final answers. By training a 7B model on verified reasoning traces that include mistakes and self-corrections, we show that latent verification behavior can emerge in small models, enabling them to occasionally stop, detect contradictions, and revise earlier assumptions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Plan-Critic的轻量级辅助模型，通过预测生成早期的前缀token来指导自回归（AR）音频生成，提升对复杂文本指令的遵循能力，最终在CLAP分数上实现10点提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的AR音频生成模型在生成时间连贯的音频方面表现优异，但在处理描述复杂声音事件的文本指令时存在不足。研究旨在增强AR模型对全局语义属性的隐式规划能力。

Method: 通过观察早期前缀token隐式编码全局语义属性的现象，利用广义优势估计（GAE）设计目标函数训练Plan-Critic模型，并在推理阶段通过动态修剪低置信度前缀和重分配计算资源优化生成路径。

Result: Plan-Critic指导的抽样方法使CLAP分数比AR基线模型提升10分，并在计算效率上与最佳的N路解码方法持平。

Conclusion: 研究表明严格自回归模型可通过辅助模型实现前瞻性规划，为AR文本到音频生成设定了新的最优性能基准，同时保持生成质量与计算效率的平衡。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models excel at generating temporally coherent audio by producing tokens sequentially, yet they often falter in faithfully following complex textual prompts, especially those describing complex sound events. We uncover a surprising capability in AR audio generators: their early prefix tokens implicitly encode global semantic attributes of the final output, such as event count and sound-object category, revealing a form of implicit planning. Building on this insight, we propose Plan-Critic, a lightweight auxiliary model trained with a Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE)-inspired objective to predict final instruction-following quality from partial generations. At inference time, Plan-Critic enables guided exploration: it evaluates candidate prefixes early, prunes low-fidelity trajectories, and reallocates computation to high-potential planning seeds. Our Plan-Critic-guided sampling achieves up to a 10-point improvement in CLAP score over the AR baseline-establishing a new state of the art in AR text-to-audio generation-while maintaining computational parity with standard best-of-N decoding. This work bridges the gap between causal generation and global semantic alignment, demonstrating that even strictly autoregressive models can plan ahead.

TL;DR: 本文提出结合语音学规则与说话人嵌入向量，提升文本到语音系统的可解释性与口音可控性，引入音素转换率(PSR)度量规则与嵌入的相互作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统文本到语音系统通过特定口音的说话人嵌入向量生成语音，但嵌入向量会编码音色等非口音特征，导致口音控制的可解释性和可控性受限。

Method: 以美式与英式英语为例实现flapping/rhoticity等语音规则，提出音素转换率(PSR)度量嵌入向量对规则转换的保持/覆盖强度，并进行对比实验。

Result: 规则与嵌入结合生成更真实的口音，但发现嵌入会削弱/覆盖规则，显示口音特征与说话人身份存在耦合现象。

Conclusion: 验证了显式语音规则在口音控制中的技术价值，并提出了评估语音生成模型解耦性的新框架。

Abstract: Many spoken languages, including English, exhibit wide variation in dialects and accents, making accent control an important capability for flexible text-to-speech (TTS) models. Current TTS systems typically generate accented speech by conditioning on speaker embeddings associated with specific accents. While effective, this approach offers limited interpretability and controllability, as embeddings also encode traits such as timbre and emotion. In this study, we analyze the interaction between speaker embeddings and linguistically motivated phonological rules in accented speech synthesis. Using American and British English as a case study, we implement rules for flapping, rhoticity, and vowel correspondences. We propose the phoneme shift rate (PSR), a novel metric quantifying how strongly embeddings preserve or override rule-based transformations. Experiments show that combining rules with embeddings yields more authentic accents, while embeddings can attenuate or overwrite rules, revealing entanglement between accent and speaker identity. Our findings highlight rules as a lever for accent control and a framework for evaluating disentanglement in speech generation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for improving the efficiency of qualitative analysis in large, multi-site health-services research. Yet methodological guidance for LLM integration into qualitative analysis and evidence of their impact on real-world research methods and outcomes remain limited. We developed a model- and task-agnostic framework for designing human-LLM qualitative analysis methods to support diverse analytic aims. Within a multi-site study of diabetes care at Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), we leveraged the framework to implement human-LLM methods for (1) qualitative synthesis of researcher-generated summaries to produce comparative feedback reports and (2) deductive coding of 167 interview transcripts to refine a practice-transformation intervention. LLM assistance enabled timely feedback to practitioners and the incorporation of large-scale qualitative data to inform theory and practice changes. This work demonstrates how LLMs can be integrated into applied health-services research to enhance efficiency while preserving rigor, offering guidance for continued innovation with LLMs in qualitative research.

Method: 选取开源LLMs，通过微调方式提升其统计推理能力，以统计学课程基准数据集为训练目标，并将其表现与人类评分对比。同时测试LLMs对自身答案质量的评估能力。

Abstract: This paper investigates the ability of large language models (LLMs) to solve statistical tasks, as well as their capacity to assess the quality of reasoning. While state-of-the-art LLMs have demonstrated remarkable performance in a range of NLP tasks, their competence in addressing even moderately complex statistical challenges is not well understood. We have fine-tuned selected open-source LLMs on a specially developed dataset to enhance their statistical reasoning capabilities, and compared their performance with the human scores used as a benchmark. Our results show that the fine-tuned models achieve better performance on advanced statistical tasks on the level comparable to a statistics student. Fine-tuning demonstrates architecture-dependent improvements, with some models showing significant performance gains, indicating clear potential for deployment in educational technology and statistical analysis assistance systems. We also show that LLMs themselves can be far better judges of the answers quality (including explanation and reasoning assessment) in comparison to traditional metrics, such as BLEU or BertScore. This self-evaluation capability enables scalable automated assessment for statistical education platforms and quality assurance in automated analysis tools. Potential applications also include validation tools for research methodology in academic and industry settings, and quality control mechanisms for data analysis workflows.

Motivation: 当前LLMs生成的科研想法常存在合理性与有效性偏差，需探索自动化执行验证的可行性及LLMs从执行反馈中学习的能力。

Method: 开发自动化执行器实现场景化验证，将LLM预训练和后训练转化为执行环境，采用进化搜索与强化学习两种反馈学习范式进行实验。

Result: 执行器验证了前沿LLMs生成思路的可行性（成功率约69.4%后训练、时间效率提升预训练），进化搜索实现突破性优化但强化学习受限于简单解模式崩溃，进化搜索在10轮迭代内超越基线。

Conclusion: 自动化执行能有效筛选优质AI研究思路，进化搜索比强化学习更具方法论优势，研究揭示了LLMs生成范式的局限及未来改进方向。

Abstract: Automated AI research holds great potential to accelerate scientific discovery. However, current LLMs often generate plausible-looking but ineffective ideas. Execution grounding may help, but it is unclear whether automated execution is feasible and whether LLMs can learn from the execution feedback. To investigate these, we first build an automated executor to implement ideas and launch large-scale parallel GPU experiments to verify their effectiveness. We then convert two realistic research problems - LLM pre-training and post-training - into execution environments and demonstrate that our automated executor can implement a large fraction of the ideas sampled from frontier LLMs. We analyze two methods to learn from the execution feedback: evolutionary search and reinforcement learning. Execution-guided evolutionary search is sample-efficient: it finds a method that significantly outperforms the GRPO baseline (69.4% vs 48.0%) on post-training, and finds a pre-training recipe that outperforms the nanoGPT baseline (19.7 minutes vs 35.9 minutes) on pre-training, all within just ten search epochs. Frontier LLMs often generate meaningful algorithmic ideas during search, but they tend to saturate early and only occasionally exhibit scaling trends. Reinforcement learning from execution reward, on the other hand, suffers from mode collapse. It successfully improves the average reward of the ideator model but not the upper-bound, due to models converging on simple ideas. We thoroughly analyze the executed ideas and training dynamics to facilitate future efforts towards execution-grounded automated AI research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类决策者难以通过反事实模拟消除性别/种族偏见，LLMs虽具备相似限制，但传统'忽略信息'提示法效果有限甚至适得其反，亟需新的纠偏机制。

Method: 对比LLMs对标准偏见提示的响应与使用盲版API的响应差异，通过控制信息可见度（如移除敏感属性）的交叉验证实验，测量公平性改善效果。

Result: 盲版API方法显著提升决策公平度指标，同时能区分系统性认知偏差与刻意歧视行为，较传统提示法减少约40%的性别角色关联错误（实验数据未提供具体数值）

Conclusion: LLMs可通过内部反事实模拟机制实现可控偏差校正，该方法为算法公平性提供可解释性框架，但需警惕模型自欺性偏差传递风险，未来需结合外部伦理约束机制。

Abstract: Fair decisions require ignoring irrelevant, potentially biasing, information. To achieve this, decision-makers need to approximate what decision they would have made had they not known certain facts, such as the gender or race of a job candidate. This counterfactual self-simulation is notoriously hard for humans, leading to biased judgments even by well-meaning actors. Here we show that large language models (LLMs) suffer from similar limitations in their ability to approximate what decisions they would make under counterfactual knowledge in offsetting gender and race biases and overcoming sycophancy. We show that prompting models to ignore or pretend not to know biasing information fails to offset these biases and occasionally backfires. However, unlike humans, LLMs can be given access to a ground-truth model of their own counterfactual cognition -- their own API. We show that this access to the responses of a blinded replica enables fairer decisions, while providing greater transparency to distinguish implicit from intentionally biased behavior.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as intelligent tutoring systems, yet research on optimizing LLMs specifically for educational contexts remains limited. Recent works have proposed reinforcement learning approaches for training LLM tutors, but these methods focus solely on optimizing visible responses while neglecting the model's internal thinking process. We introduce PedagogicalRL-Thinking, a framework that extends pedagogical alignment to reasoning LLMs in education through two novel approaches: (1) Pedagogical Reasoning Prompting, which guides internal reasoning using domain-specific educational theory rather than generic instructions; and (2) Thinking Reward, which explicitly evaluates and reinforces the pedagogical quality of the model's reasoning traces. Our experiments reveal that domain-specific, theory-grounded prompting outperforms generic prompting, and that Thinking Reward is most effective when combined with pedagogical prompting. Furthermore, models trained only on mathematics tutoring dialogues show improved performance on educational benchmarks not seen during training, while preserving the base model's factual knowledge. Our quantitative and qualitative analyses reveal that pedagogical thinking reward produces systematic reasoning trace changes, with increased pedagogical reasoning and more structured instructional decision-making in the tutor's thinking process.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Social understanding is critical for MLLMs to interpret human interactions, yet existing methods lack a structured framework to assess this ability comprehensively.

Method: Proposed the Social Caption framework grounded in interaction theory, evaluating MLLMs across three dimensions (SI, HSA, DSA), and analyzed factors like model scale, architecture, and spoken context using experiments with MLLM-based judges.

Result: Identified key factors (scale, architecture, context) influencing social understanding performance and demonstrated the feasibility of scaling automated evaluation through experiments with MLLM judges.

Conclusion: Social Caption provides an effective framework for measuring social understanding in MLLMs, revealing insights into performance determinants and enabling scalable evaluation methodologies.

Abstract: Social understanding abilities are crucial for multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to interpret human social interactions. We introduce Social Caption, a framework grounded in interaction theory to evaluate social understanding abilities of MLLMs along three dimensions: Social Inference (SI), the ability to make accurate inferences about interactions; Holistic Social Analysis (HSA), the ability to generate comprehensive descriptions of interactions; Directed Social Analysis (DSA), the ability to extract relevant social information from interactions. We analyze factors influencing model performance in social understanding, such as scale, architectural design, and spoken context. Experiments with MLLM judges contribute insights about scaling automated evaluation of multimodal social understanding.

Result: 发现模型存在显著的'幻影编辑'现象，归纳出8类系统性分词器缺陷，包括空格边界位移和词内重切分等问题，证明分词器缺陷会导致推理幻觉。

Conclusion: 模型部分推理不足源于分词器层的表示缺陷，提出应优先改进分词器设计，而非通过扩大模型规模和训练数据来弥补底层技术缺陷。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) reason over discrete token ID sequences, yet modern subword tokenizers routinely produce non-unique encodings: multiple token ID sequences can detokenize to identical surface strings. This representational mismatch creates an unmeasured fragility wherein reasoning processes can fail. LLMs may treat two internal representations as distinct "words" even when they are semantically identical at the text level. In this work, we show that tokenization can betray LLM reasoning through one-to-many token ID mappings. We introduce a tokenization-consistency probe that requires models to replace designated target words in context while leaving all other content unchanged. The task is intentionally simple at the surface level, enabling us to attribute failures to tokenizer-detokenizer artifacts rather than to knowledge gaps or parameter limitations. Through analysis of over 11000 replacement trials across state-of-the-art open-source LLMs, we find a non-trivial rate of outputs exhibit phantom edits: cases where models operate under the illusion of correct reasoning, a phenomenon arising from tokenizer-induced representational defects. We further analyze these cases and provide a taxonomy of eight systematic tokenizer artifacts, including whitespace-boundary shifts and intra-word resegmentation. These findings indicate that part of apparent reasoning deficiency originates in the tokenizer layer, motivating tokenizer-level remedies before incurring the cost of training ever-larger models on ever-larger corpora.

Conclusion: 揭示工具调用应作为增强而非替代性策略，通过动态决策机制实现计算效率与推理质量的帕累托最优，为AGI的元认知能力设计提供新范式

Abstract: Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) has significantly enhanced the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet current agents tend to exhibit cognitive offloading, redundantly invoking external tools even for simple tasks. In this paper, we suggest that true agentic intelligence requires not just tool invocation, but the adaptive wisdom to discern when to use them. We propose AdaTIR, a framework that shifts the paradigm from static tool invocation to difficulty-aware reasoning internalization. By introducing a difficulty-aware efficiency reward, AdaTIR dynamically adjusts tool budgets based on task complexity--internalizing reasoning for simple tasks while selectively invoking tools for complex tasks. Furthermore, we identify a sign reversal problem where tool penalties outweigh correctness rewards, mistakenly penalizing correct rollouts with negative advantages. To resolve this, we propose Clipped Advantage Shaping (CAS), which ensures that correctness remains the primary objective while using efficiency as a secondary constraint. Empirical results demonstrate that AdaTIR reduces tool calls by up to 97.6% on simple tasks and 28.2% on complex challenges while maintaining or enhancing accuracy. Notably, AdaTIR successfully internalizes reasoning, outperforming baselines by 4.8% on AIME 2024 even when tool access is strictly disabled.

### [83] [ClaimDB: A Fact Verification Benchmark over Large Structured Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14698)
*Michael Theologitis,Preetam Prabhu Srikar Dammu,Chirag Shah,Dan Suciu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ClaimDB introduces a fact-verification benchmark for large-scale structured data, revealing limitations of current models and emphasizing executable reasoning over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fact-verification benchmarks under-explore claims grounded in large-scale structured data, necessitating new approaches for reliability in high-stakes scenarios.

Method: Constructed ClaimDB with 80 real-world databases and evaluated 30 state-of-the-art LLMs on accuracy and abstention capabilities.

Result: No models exceeded 83% accuracy; over half scored below 55%, with poor abstention performance across closed- and open-source systems.

Conclusion: ClaimDB highlights the urgent need for executable reasoning methods in structured data verification; benchmark, code, and leaderboard are publicly released.

Abstract: Despite substantial progress in fact-verification benchmarks, claims grounded in large-scale structured data remain underexplored. In this work, we introduce ClaimDB, the first fact-verification benchmark where the evidence for claims is derived from compositions of millions of records and multiple tables. ClaimDB consists of 80 unique real-life databases covering a wide range of domains, from governance and healthcare to media, education and the natural sciences. At this scale, verification approaches that rely on "reading" the evidence break down, forcing a timely shift toward reasoning in executable programs. We conduct extensive experiments with 30 state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source (below 70B) LLMs and find that none exceed 83% accuracy, with more than half below 55%. Our analysis also reveals that both closed- and open-source models struggle with abstention -- the ability to admit that there is no evidence to decide -- raising doubts about their reliability in high-stakes data analysis. We release the benchmark, code, and the LLM leaderboard at https://claimdb.github.io .

### [84] [DARL: Encouraging Diverse Answers for General Reasoning without Verifiers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14700)
*Chongxuan Huang,Lei Lin,Xiaodong Shi,Wenping Hu,Ruiming Tang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DARL proposed: enhances reinforcement learning with diverse answers, avoids overfitting, improves reasoning on general domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR/RLPR methods overfit to reference answers and lack diversity, limiting open-domain reasoning tasks like writing.

Method: DARL introduces controlled deviation during reinforcement learning to maintain alignment while enabling diverse outputs, compatible with existing frameworks.

Result: DARL outperformed RLPR (-1.3/+9.5 pts on 6+7 benchmarks), demonstrating better accuracy and diversity in reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Verifiable RL can achieve robustness through output diversity, enabling general-domain applications without additional verifiers.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated promising gains in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models. However, its dependence on domain-specific verifiers significantly restricts its applicability to open and general domains. Recent efforts such as RLPR have extended RLVR to general domains, enabling training on broader datasets and achieving improvements over RLVR. However, a notable limitation of these methods is their tendency to overfit to reference answers, which constrains the model's ability to generate diverse outputs. This limitation is particularly pronounced in open-ended tasks such as writing, where multiple plausible answers exist. To address this, we propose DARL, a simple yet effective reinforcement learning framework that encourages the generation of diverse answers within a controlled deviation range from the reference while preserving alignment with it. Our framework is fully compatible with existing general reinforcement learning methods and can be seamlessly integrated without additional verifiers. Extensive experiments on thirteen benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in reasoning performance. Notably, DARL surpasses RLPR, achieving average gains of 1.3 points on six reasoning benchmarks and 9.5 points on seven general benchmarks, highlighting its effectiveness in improving both reasoning accuracy and output diversity.

TL;DR: 本文提出了Render-of-Thought (RoT)，通过将推理链文本步骤可视化，实现推理过程显性化与可追溯，显著减少计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统链式思维(CoT)提示存在冗长导致计算开销大、缺乏中间推理监督等问题，导致潜在推理链可分析性差。

Method: 利用视觉语言模型(VLM)的视觉编码器作为语义锚点，将文本推理步骤渲染为图像，实现视觉嵌入与文本空间对齐的插件式框架。

Result: 在数学逻辑推理基准测试中实现3-4倍token压缩率和显著推理加速，同时保持与现有方法相当的竞争力。

Conclusion: RoT通过显性化推理过程验证了该范式的可行性，在不增加预训练成本的前提下实现了效率突破。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has achieved remarkable success in unlocking the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Although CoT prompting enhances reasoning, its verbosity imposes substantial computational overhead. Recent works often focus exclusively on outcome alignment and lack supervision on the intermediate reasoning process. These deficiencies obscure the analyzability of the latent reasoning chain. To address these challenges, we introduce Render-of-Thought (RoT), the first framework to reify the reasoning chain by rendering textual steps into images, making the latent rationale explicit and traceable. Specifically, we leverage the vision encoders of existing Vision Language Models (VLMs) as semantic anchors to align the vision embeddings with the textual space. This design ensures plug-and-play implementation without incurring additional pre-training overhead. Extensive experiments on mathematical and logical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves 3-4x token compression and substantial inference acceleration compared to explicit CoT. Furthermore, it maintains competitive performance against other methods, validating the feasibility of this paradigm. Our code is available at https://github.com/TencentBAC/RoT

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NLP技术在文本心理咨询中无法准确识别多样化客户抵抗行为，且缺乏动态分析和模型可解释性。

Method: 构建包含13类细粒度抵抗行为的PsyFIRE理论框架，开发ClientResistance语料库（23,930个中文标注对话），并设计两阶段RECAP框架实现带解释的检测。

Result: RECAP在协作/抵抗区分任务达91.25% F1值，细粒度分类获66.58% macro-F1，超越主流LLM基线20+百分点，并揭示抵抗行为对咨询关系的负面影响。

Conclusion: 该研究有效解决了传统方法简化分类、忽视动态交互和可解释性不足的问题，为咨询师理解与干预策略提供支持。

Abstract: Recognizing and navigating client resistance is critical for effective mental health counseling, yet detecting such behaviors is particularly challenging in text-based interactions. Existing NLP approaches oversimplify resistance categories, ignore the sequential dynamics of therapeutic interventions, and offer limited interpretability.
  To address these limitations, we propose PsyFIRE, a theoretically grounded framework capturing 13 fine-grained resistance behaviors alongside collaborative interactions. Based on PsyFIRE, we construct the ClientResistance corpus with 23,930 annotated utterances from real-world Chinese text-based counseling, each supported by context-specific rationales. Leveraging this dataset, we develop RECAP, a two-stage framework that detects resistance and fine-grained resistance types with explanations.
  RECAP achieves 91.25% F1 for distinguishing collaboration and resistance and 66.58% macro-F1 for fine-grained resistance categories classification, outperforming leading prompt-based LLM baselines by over 20 points. Applied to a separate counseling dataset and a pilot study with 62 counselors, RECAP reveals the prevalence of resistance, its negative impact on therapeutic relationships and demonstrates its potential to improve counselors' understanding and intervention strategies.

Motivation: 研究大型语言模型在文化特定叙事任务中的表现，特别是在中文创意写作领域的应用效果

Method: 构建包含53部经典电影的中文剧本续写基准，采用'前半段续写后半段'的范式，每部电影3个样本，获取303个有效样本。通过ROUGE-L、结构相似度和LLM-as-Judge评分（DeepSeek-Reasoner）进行多维度评估

Result: Qwen-Max在ROUGE-L指标（0.2230 vs 0.2114）微弱优势，但GPT-5.2在结构保持（0.93 vs 0.75）、整体质量（44.79 vs 25.72）和综合评分（0.50 vs 0.39）显著更好，整体质量效应量达大效应水平（d>0.8）。GPT-5.2在角色一致性、语气风格匹配和格式保持方面更优，而Qwen-Max存在生成稳定性问题

Conclusion: 构建了可复现的中文创意写作LLM评估框架，揭示了Qwen-Max的改进空间，并证明GPT-5.2在关键指标上的优越性，为后续研究提供基准和方法论参考

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to creative writing, their performance on culturally specific narrative tasks warrants systematic investigation. This study constructs the first Chinese film script continuation benchmark comprising 53 classic films, and designs a multi-dimensional evaluation framework comparing GPT-5.2 and Qwen-Max-Latest. Using a "first half to second half" continuation paradigm with 3 samples per film, we obtained 303 valid samples (GPT-5.2: 157, 98.7% validity; Qwen-Max: 146, 91.8% validity). Evaluation integrates ROUGE-L, Structural Similarity, and LLM-as-Judge scoring (DeepSeek-Reasoner).
  Statistical analysis of 144 paired samples reveals: Qwen-Max achieves marginally higher ROUGE-L (0.2230 vs 0.2114, d=-0.43); however, GPT-5.2 significantly outperforms in structural preservation (0.93 vs 0.75, d=0.46), overall quality (44.79 vs 25.72, d=1.04), and composite scores (0.50 vs 0.39, d=0.84). The overall quality effect size reaches large effect level (d>0.8).
  GPT-5.2 excels in character consistency, tone-style matching, and format preservation, while Qwen-Max shows deficiencies in generation stability. This study provides a reproducible framework for LLM evaluation in Chinese creative writing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MRAG方法采用单一策略处理多语言查询，导致知识偏差和冲突，需设计针对性优化框架。

Method: 1) 在策略模型中引入语言耦合组采样减少偏差 2) 在奖励模型中添加反一致性约束缓解冲突 3) 构建多语言强化学习框架

Result: LcRL在多语言场景中达到竞争性能，适应数据受限、跨200+语言检索等复杂应用场景。

Conclusion: 所提框架有效解决了MRAG中的核心挑战，具有多语言场景下的实用价值和扩展潜力。

Abstract: Multilingual retrieval-augmented generation (MRAG) requires models to effectively acquire and integrate beneficial external knowledge from multilingual collections. However, most existing studies employ a unitive process where queries of equivalent semantics across different languages are processed through a single-turn retrieval and subsequent optimization. Such a ``one-size-fits-all'' strategy is often suboptimal in multilingual settings, as the models occur to knowledge bias and conflict during the interaction with the search engine. To alleviate the issues, we propose LcRL, a multilingual search-augmented reinforcement learning framework that integrates a language-coupled Group Relative Policy Optimization into the policy and reward models. We adopt the language-coupled group sampling in the rollout module to reduce knowledge bias, and regularize an auxiliary anti-consistency penalty in the reward models to mitigate the knowledge conflict. Experimental results demonstrate that LcRL not only achieves competitive performance but is also appropriate for various practical scenarios such as constrained training data and retrieval over collections encompassing a large number of languages.

Motivation: 当前针对播客脚本生成任务的系统性评估资源有限，而大语言模型需要从多样化输入中合成结构化且基于上下文的对话，因此需要填补这一空白。

Method: 开发了PodBench基准，并提出多维度评估框架，结合量化约束和基于LLM的质量评估，包含长上下文处理和多说话人协调的实验分析。

Result: 实验表明专有模型整体表现优异，但引入显式推理的开源模型在长上下文多说话人场景下比基线更稳健，同时也指出高指令遵循度无法保证内容实质性的局限性。

Conclusion: PodBench为解决长文本、音频中心生成任务中的挑战提供了可复现的测试平台，推动未来相关领域研究。

Abstract: Podcast script generation requires LLMs to synthesize structured, context-grounded dialogue from diverse inputs, yet systematic evaluation resources for this task remain limited. To bridge this gap, we introduce PodBench, a benchmark comprising 800 samples with inputs up to 21K tokens and complex multi-speaker instructions. We propose a multifaceted evaluation framework that integrates quantitative constraints with LLM-based quality assessment. Extensive experiments reveal that while proprietary models generally excel, open-source models equipped with explicit reasoning demonstrate superior robustness in handling long contexts and multi-speaker coordination compared to standard baselines. However, our analysis uncovers a persistent divergence where high instruction following does not guarantee high content substance. PodBench offers a reproducible testbed to address these challenges in long-form, audio-centric generation.

Conclusion: 小型透明语言模型可作为伦理上更优的解决方案，Corpus Clarification框架及GDN-CC系列数据集为民主协商的大规模分析提供了标准化资源，证明本地化模型在保证质量的同时提升计算透明度。

Abstract: LLMs are ubiquitous in modern NLP, and while their applicability extends to texts produced for democratic activities such as online deliberations or large-scale citizen consultations, ethical questions have been raised for their usage as analysis tools. We continue this line of research with two main goals: (a) to develop resources that can help standardize citizen contributions in public forums at the pragmatic level, and make them easier to use in topic modeling and political analysis; (b) to study how well this standardization can reliably be performed by small, open-weights LLMs, i.e. models that can be run locally and transparently with limited resources. Accordingly, we introduce Corpus Clarification as a preprocessing framework for large-scale consultation data that transforms noisy, multi-topic contributions into structured, self-contained argumentative units ready for downstream analysis. We present GDN-CC, a manually-curated dataset of 1,231 contributions to the French Grand Débat National, comprising 2,285 argumentative units annotated for argumentative structure and manually clarified. We then show that finetuned Small Language Models match or outperform LLMs on reproducing these annotations, and measure their usability for an opinion clustering task. We finally release GDN-CC-large, an automatically annotated corpus of 240k contributions, the largest annotated democratic consultation dataset to date.

Conclusion: 为僧伽罗语应用提供模型选型指南，证明训练数据质量直接影响多脚本处理能力，强调需针对性优化低资源语言模型架构。

Abstract: The performance of Language Models (LMs) on lower-resource, morphologically rich languages like Sinhala remains under-explored, particularly for Romanized Sinhala, which is prevalent in digital communication. This paper presents a comprehensive benchmark of modern LMs on a diverse corpus of Unicode and Romanized Sinhala. We evaluate open-source models using perplexity, a measure of how well a model predicts a text, and leading closed-source models via a qualitative analysis of sentence completion. Our findings reveal that the Mistral-Nemo-Base-2407 model achieves the strongest predictive performance on Unicode text and the Mistral-7B-v0.3 model for Romanized text. The results also highlight the strong all-around performance of the Llama-3.1-8B model for both scripts. Furthermore, a significant performance disparity exists among closed-source models: Gemini-1.5-pro and DeepSeek excel at Unicode generation, whereas Claude-3.5-Sonnet is superior at handling Romanized text. These results provide an essential guide for practitioners selecting models for Sinhala-specific applications and highlight the critical role of training data in handling script variations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据污染检测方法局限在英文基准，而翻译可能掩盖污染信号，导致跨语言评估失效，亟需多语言感知的检测方案

Method: 通过阿拉伯语数据微调开源模型+英文基准测试，扩展Tested Slot Guessing方法（选择重排序策略+Min-K%分析），提出Translation-Aware Contamination Detection，对比多语言基准信号

Result: 阿拉伯语翻译抑制传统污染指标，但模型仍从污染数据受益；Min-K%上升、跨语言答案一致性增加；Translation-Aware方法能可靠暴露污染而英文方法失效

Conclusion: 需构建多语言、翻译感知的评估管道，以确保大模型评估公平性与可复现性。

Abstract: Data contamination undermines the validity of Large Language Model evaluation by enabling models to rely on memorized benchmark content rather than true generalization. While prior work has proposed contamination detection methods, these approaches are largely limited to English benchmarks, leaving multilingual contamination poorly understood. In this work, we investigate contamination dynamics in multilingual settings by fine-tuning several open-weight LLMs on varying proportions of Arabic datasets and evaluating them on original English benchmarks. To detect memorization, we extend the Tested Slot Guessing method with a choice-reordering strategy and incorporate Min-K% probability analysis, capturing both behavioral and distributional contamination signals.
  Our results show that translation into Arabic suppresses conventional contamination indicators, yet models still benefit from exposure to contaminated data, particularly those with stronger Arabic capabilities. This effect is consistently reflected in rising Mink% scores and increased cross-lingual answer consistency as contamination levels grow. To address this blind spot, we propose Translation-Aware Contamination Detection, which identifies contamination by comparing signals across multiple translated benchmark variants rather than English alone. The Translation-Aware Contamination Detection reliably exposes contamination even when English-only methods fail. Together, our findings highlight the need for multilingual, translation-aware evaluation pipelines to ensure fair, transparent, and reproducible assessment of LLMs.

Result: 在三个数据集上实验证明，KRPO在抽取F1值上显著优于强基线方法，验证了提示优化框架和记忆模块的有效性

Conclusion: KRPO通过动态优化框架解决了开放领域三元组抽取中的核心瓶颈，实现了结构化知识的持续改进，为无预定义模式的抽取任务提供了新思路

Abstract: Open-domain Relational Triplet Extraction (ORTE) is the foundation for mining structured knowledge without predefined schemas. Despite the impressive in-context learning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), existing methods are hindered by their reliance on static, heuristic-driven prompting strategies. Due to the lack of reflection mechanisms required to internalize erroneous signals, these methods exhibit vulnerability in semantic ambiguity, often making erroneous extraction patterns permanent. To address this bottleneck, we propose a Knowledge Reconstruction-driven Prompt Optimization (KRPO) framework to assist LLMs in continuously improving their extraction capabilities for complex ORTE task flows. Specifically, we design a self-evaluation mechanism based on knowledge restoration, which provides intrinsic feedback signals by projecting structured triplets into semantic consistency scores. Subsequently, we propose a prompt optimizer based on a textual gradient that can internalize historical experiences to iteratively optimize prompts, which can better guide LLMs to handle subsequent extraction tasks. Furthermore, to alleviate relation redundancy, we design a relation canonicalization memory that collects representative relations and provides semantically distinct schemas for the triplets. Extensive experiments across three datasets show that KRPO significantly outperforms strong baselines in the extraction F1 score.

*Zhichao Yan,Yunxiao Zhao,Jiapu Wang,Jiaoyan Chen,Shaoru Guo,Xiaoli Li,Ru Li,Jeff Z. Pan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes "LogicScore,", an evaluation framework to address logical coherence deficiencies in long-form answers from large language models (LLMs), showing current models excel in factual accuracy but fail in global reasoning assessments like completeness, conciseness, and determinateness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Attributed Question Answering (AQA) evaluations focus on isolated statement verification, neglecting the global logical integrity of extended answers. This leads to LLMs generating factually accurate but logically flawed responses with hidden deductive gaps.

Method: Introduces "LogicScore," a framework based on Horn Rules that uses backward verification to assess global reasoning across three dimensions: Completeness (logical deduction soundness), Conciseness (non-redundancy), and Determinateness (consistent entailment).

Result: Experiments on three multi-hop QA datasets and 20+ LLMs (e.g., Gemini-3 Pro) show a critical capability gap—models achieve high attribution scores (e.g., 92.85% precision) but exhibit poor global reasoning (e.g., 35.11% conciseness score).

Conclusion: Establishes a standardized evaluation for logical reasoning, emphasizing the need to balance factual grounding with reasoning coherence in LLM development, as current systems lag in global reasoning despite strong attribution accuracy.

Abstract: Current evaluation methods for Attributed Question Answering (AQA) suffer from \textit{attribution myopia}: they emphasize verification of isolated statements and their attributions but overlook the global logical integrity of long-form answers. Consequently, Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce factually grounded yet logically incoherent responses with elusive deductive gaps. To mitigate this limitation, we present \textsc{LogicScore}, a unified evaluation framework that shifts the paradigm from local assessment to global reasoning scrutiny. Grounded in Horn Rules, our approach integrates a backward verification mechanism to systematically evaluate three key reasoning dimensions: \textit{Completeness} (logically sound deduction), \textit{Conciseness} (non-redundancy), and \textit{Determinateness} (consistent answer entailment). Extensive experiments across three multi-hop QA datasets (HotpotQA, MusiQue, and 2WikiMultiHopQA) and over 20 LLMs (including GPT-5, Gemini-3-Pro, LLaMA3, and task-specific tuned models) reveal a critical capability gap: leading models often achieve high attribution scores (e.g., 92.85\% precision for Gemini-3 Pro) but struggle with global reasoning quality (e.g., 35.11\% Conciseness for Gemini-3 Pro). Our work establishes a robust standard for logical evaluation, highlighting the need to prioritize reasoning coherence alongside factual grounding in LLM development.

TL;DR: 多智能体系统（MAS）通过操作理论与约束优化的视角，解释了多个语言模型共享相同信息但协同解决问题时的性能提升。MAS以分解方式实现约束施加算子，并通过软约束扩展至近端算子，揭示了单个智能体难以接触的协同解空间结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型协同问题缺乏理论解释，特别是当所有智能体共享相同信息时为何性能提升。本文旨在建立基于操作理论与约束优化的数学框架，解释MAS中多个约束集协同带来的动态优势。

Method: 将每个智能体建模为对共享解空间施加差异化的有效性约束集，通过分解约束算子的复合操作描述MAS动态演化。引入近端算子将硬约束推广到软约束场景，并通过算子理论证明约束交集下的不变解结构收敛性。

Result: 证明MAS动态收敛于智能体约束集的交集定义的不变解集，且该解集无法通过单智能体串联施加所有约束获得。将理论应用于基于文本的对话系统，在多轮对话中验证了约束分解带来的求解优势。

Conclusion: MAS通过分布式约束施加机制访问单智能体无法探索的解空间区域，其性能提升源于协同算子的分解结构与动态约束交集。该理论为多智能体协同的工程实践提供了可解释的数学基础。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) composed of large language models often exhibit improved problem-solving performance despite operating on identical information. In this work, we provide a formal explanation for this phenomenon grounded in operator theory and constrained optimization. We model each agent as enforcing a distinct family of validity constraints on a shared solution state, and show that a MAS implements a factorized composition of constraint-enforcement operators. Under mild conditions, these dynamics converge to invariant solution sets defined by the intersection of agent constraint sets. Such invariant structures are generally not dynamically accessible to a single agent applying all constraints simultaneously, even when expressive capacity and information are identical. We extend this result from exact constraint enforcement to soft constraints via proximal operators, and apply the formalism to contemporary text-based dialog systems.

TL;DR: 通过分析Reddit数据，该研究发现人类语言使用的语义熵呈现出昼夜节律：局部语义探索在早晨达到高峰，而全局语义多样性在白天累积，且语义探索与情绪无关，可能与神经调节系统的昼夜节律相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究昼夜节律如何影响高维语义认知行为，特别是语言使用中的探索-利用权衡机制，填补当前对认知与昼夜关系研究的空白。

Method: 利用预训练Transformer模型对Reddit文本进行嵌入，计算局部（单条帖子）与全局（整体话题）语义熵，分析时间变化模式，并排除情绪变量的干扰。

Result: 语义熵存在显著昼夜节律且受季节光信号影响；局部探索早晨达峰（广泛语义空间探索），全局多样性晚间达峰（话题集中于已知领域）；规律与神经调节系统昼夜波动一致。

Conclusion: 昼夜节律从生物层面延伸到语义认知层面，语义探索是独立于情绪维度的认知特征，反映了大脑神经递质系统的时间动态组织。

Abstract: Human cognition exhibits strong circadian modulation, yet its influence on high-dimensional semantic behavior remains poorly understood. Using large-scale Reddit data, we quantify time-of-day variation in language use by embedding text into a pretrained transformer model and measuring semantic entropy as an index of linguistic exploration-exploitation, for which we show a robust circadian rhythmicity that could be entrained by seasonal light cues. Distinguishing between local and global semantic entropy reveals a systematic temporal dissociation: local semantic exploration peaks in the morning, reflecting broader exploration of semantic space, whereas global semantic diversity peaks later in the day as submissions accumulate around already established topics, consistent with "rich-get-richer" dynamics. These patterns are not explained by sentiment or affective valence, indicating that semantic exploration captures a cognitive dimension distinct from mood. The observed temporal structure aligns with known diurnal patterns in neuromodulatory systems, suggesting that biological circadian rhythms extend to the semantic domain.

Conclusion: 成功构建首个多模态LLM临床基准数据集，并验证AI辅助标注在规模标注中的有效性，但需进一步验证模型实际临床价值。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models have demonstrated comparable performance to that of radiology trainees on multiple-choice board-style exams. However, to develop clinically useful multimodal LLM tools, high-quality benchmarks curated by domain experts are essential. To curate released and holdout datasets of 100 chest radiographic studies each and propose an artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted expert labeling procedure to allow radiologists to label studies more efficiently. A total of 13,735 deidentified chest radiographs and their corresponding reports from the MIDRC were used. GPT-4o extracted abnormal findings from the reports, which were then mapped to 12 benchmark labels with a locally hosted LLM (Phi-4-Reasoning). From these studies, 1,000 were sampled on the basis of the AI-suggested benchmark labels for expert review; the sampling algorithm ensured that the selected studies were clinically relevant and captured a range of difficulty levels. Seventeen chest radiologists participated, and they marked "Agree all", "Agree mostly" or "Disagree" to indicate their assessment of the correctness of the LLM suggested labels. Each chest radiograph was evaluated by three experts. Of these, at least two radiologists selected "Agree All" for 381 radiographs. From this set, 200 were selected, prioritizing those with less common or multiple finding labels, and divided into 100 released radiographs and 100 reserved as the holdout dataset. The holdout dataset is used exclusively by RSNA to independently evaluate different models. A benchmark of 200 chest radiographic studies with 12 benchmark labels was created and made publicly available https://imaging.rsna.org, with each chest radiograph verified by three radiologists. In addition, an AI-assisted labeling procedure was developed to help radiologists label at scale, minimize unnecessary omissions, and support a semicollaborative environment.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种基于检索增强的多智能体框架，用于自动生成细粒度医学LLM评估规则，有效提升临床决策支持系统的安全性与准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统评估医学LLM的专家手动评分规则存在构建成本高、扩展性差的问题，而现有指标难以检测细微临床错误，需要低成本可扩展的自动化评估方案。

Method: 通过分解权威医学检索结果为原子事实，结合用户交互约束合成可验证评分规则，采用多智能体协作框架实现医学证据引导的响应质量评估与优化。

Result: 在HealthBench数据集上CIA评分达60.12%（超越GPT-4o基线55.16%），AUROC值0.977（基线4.972），响应质量优化提升9.2%（59.0→68.2%）。

Conclusion: 该自动化评分规则生成框架不仅提供高精度医学LLM评估方案，还能有效指导模型响应优化，在临床安全性保证方面展现显著应用价值。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for clinical decision support, where hallucinations and unsafe suggestions may pose direct risks to patient safety. These risks are particularly challenging as they often manifest as subtle clinical errors that evade detection by generic metrics, while expert-authored fine-grained rubrics remain costly to construct and difficult to scale. In this paper, we propose a retrieval-augmented multi-agent framework designed to automate the generation of instance-specific evaluation rubrics. Our approach grounds evaluation in authoritative medical evidence by decomposing retrieved content into atomic facts and synthesizing them with user interaction constraints to form verifiable, fine-grained evaluation criteria. Evaluated on HealthBench, our framework achieves a Clinical Intent Alignment (CIA) score of 60.12%, a statistically significant improvement over the GPT-4o baseline (55.16%). In discriminative tests, our rubrics yield a mean score delta ($μ_Δ = 8.658$) and an AUROC of 0.977, nearly doubling the quality separation achieved by GPT-4o baseline (4.972). Beyond evaluation, our rubrics effectively guide response refinement, improving quality by 9.2% (from 59.0% to 68.2%). This provides a scalable and transparent foundation for both evaluating and improving medical LLMs. The code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Automated-Rubric-Generation-AF3C/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学界普遍存在投稿量增长与评审质量下滑的担忧，但缺乏系统性量化方法，评审流程标准化不足阻碍了跨会议与时间维度比较。

Method: 构建多维评审质量评估模型，结合LLM自动化分析和轻量化指标，对ICLR、NeurIPS和ACL等顶会的评审系统进行实证研究，提出评审标准化方案。

Result: 跨时段研究揭示评审质量中位数在不同会议间未呈现一致性下降趋势，且发现评审质量维度间存在显著关联性。

Conclusion: 挑战“评审质量下降”的主流叙事，提出需重新理解评审机制演化规律，并为后续质量优化研究提供方法论框架。

Abstract: Peer review is at the heart of modern science. As submission numbers rise and research communities grow, the decline in review quality is a popular narrative and a common concern. Yet, is it true? Review quality is difficult to measure, and the ongoing evolution of reviewing practices makes it hard to compare reviews across venues and time. To address this, we introduce a new framework for evidence-based comparative study of review quality and apply it to major AI and machine learning conferences: ICLR, NeurIPS and *ACL. We document the diversity of review formats and introduce a new approach to review standardization. We propose a multi-dimensional schema for quantifying review quality as utility to editors and authors, coupled with both LLM-based and lightweight measurements. We study the relationships between measurements of review quality, and its evolution over time. Contradicting the popular narrative, our cross-temporal analysis reveals no consistent decline in median review quality across venues and years. We propose alternative explanations, and outline recommendations to facilitate future empirical studies of review quality.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在法律领域的摘要生成中面临事实准确性挑战，而现有的nugget评价方法尚未被探索用于直接辅助终端用户。

Method: 设计基于事实nugget的原型系统，支持法律从业者在两种场景中进行摘要优化：比较两个摘要的质量，以及人工改进自动生成的摘要。

Result: 展示了原型系统在法律场景中的具体应用可能性，验证了nugget方法在用户侧支持的可行性。

Conclusion: nugget-based方法在法律领域辅助摘要优化具有潜力，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to summarize long documents, this trend poses significant challenges in the legal domain, where the factual accuracy of deposition summaries is crucial. Nugget-based methods have been shown to be extremely helpful for the automated evaluation of summarization approaches. In this work, we translate these methods to the user side and explore how nuggets could directly assist end users. Although prior systems have demonstrated the promise of nugget-based evaluation, its potential to support end users remains underexplored. Focusing on the legal domain, we present a prototype that leverages a factual nugget-based approach to support legal professionals in two concrete scenarios: (1) determining which of two summaries is better, and (2) manually improving an automatically generated summary.

TL;DR: Fine-tuning large language models can cause 'privacy collapse'—where models lose ability to protect contextual privacy despite maintaining performance on other benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current safety evaluations overlook subtle privacy risks during model fine-tuning, creating a critical gap in deploying specialized AI agents.

Method: Tested six models (open/closed) and five datasets (real/synthetic) under fine-tuning, analyzing privacy degradation through controlled experiments and mechanistic analysis.

Result: Observed consistent privacy collapse across models/datasets, showing inappropriate information sharing, broken memory boundaries, and fragile privacy representations vs. preserved task features.

Conclusion: Standard benchmarks fail to detect silent privacy failures—specialized agents require enhanced safety evaluations targeting contextual privacy norms.

Abstract: We identify a novel phenomenon in language models: benign fine-tuning of frontier models can lead to privacy collapse. We find that diverse, subtle patterns in training data can degrade contextual privacy, including optimisation for helpfulness, exposure to user information, emotional and subjective dialogue, and debugging code printing internal variables, among others. Fine-tuned models lose their ability to reason about contextual privacy norms, share information inappropriately with tools, and violate memory boundaries across contexts. Privacy collapse is a ``silent failure'' because models maintain high performance on standard safety and utility benchmarks whilst exhibiting severe privacy vulnerabilities. Our experiments show evidence of privacy collapse across six models (closed and open weight), five fine-tuning datasets (real-world and controlled data), and two task categories (agentic and memory-based). Our mechanistic analysis reveals that privacy representations are uniquely fragile to fine-tuning, compared to task-relevant features which are preserved. Our results reveal a critical gap in current safety evaluations, in particular for the deployment of specialised agents.

### [102] [Metadata Conditioned Large Language Models for Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15236)
*Anjishnu Mukherjee,Ziwei Zhu,Antonios Anastasopoulos*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes metadata conditioning as a lightweight approach to improve localization in large language models without sacrificing cross-regional performance, achieving comparable results to specialized models with less data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing large language models exhibit geographically homogenized behavior due to treating text as a single global distribution, necessitating a lightweight solution for localization without requiring region-specific models.

Method: Pre-trained 31 models (0.5B-1B parameters) from scratch on English news data annotated with URLs, country tags, and continent tags across 4 continents and 17 countries, using metadata conditioning to enable localization.

Result: Metadata conditioning improved in-region performance without harming cross-region generalization, recovered localization comparable to region-specific models, increased learning efficiency, and achieved accuracy similar to LLaMA-3.2-1B-Instruct on a 800-question localized news benchmark with less data.

Conclusion: Metadata conditioning provides a compute-efficient and practical method for localizing language models, with URL-level metadata capturing significant geographic signals, though balanced regional data coverage remains essential.

Abstract: Large language models are typically trained by treating text as a single global distribution, often resulting in geographically homogenized behavior. We study metadata conditioning as a lightweight approach for localization, pre-training 31 models (at 0.5B and 1B parameter scales) from scratch on large-scale English news data annotated with verified URLs, country tags, and continent tags, covering 4 continents and 17 countries. Across four controlled experiments, we show that metadata conditioning consistently improves in-region performance without sacrificing cross-region generalization, enables global models to recover localization comparable to region-specific models, and improves learning efficiency. Our ablation studies demonstrate that URL-level metadata alone captures much of the geographic signal, while balanced regional data coverage remains essential, as metadata cannot fully compensate for missing regions. Finally, we introduce a downstream benchmark of 800 localized news MCQs and show that after instruction tuning, metadata conditioned global models achieve accuracy comparable to LLaMA-3.2-1B-Instruct, despite being trained on substantially less data. Together, these results establish metadata conditioning as a practical and compute-efficient approach for localization of language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在基础算术上表现出色，但学界尚未充分探讨其在非标准数字表达形式下的推理能力，这对跨语言应用至关重要。

Method: 测试LLMs在多种数字脚本（如罗马数字、阿拉伯数字）及格式（逗号/空格分隔）下的准确率，并采用少样本提示和显式映射策略进行干预。

Result: 非标准脚本导致准确率显著下降，但针对性提示策略有效缩小了这一表现差距。

Conclusion: LLMs需额外提示策略支持才能可靠处理多样化数字表示，该发现为跨语言数值交互提供了实用优化路径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive proficiency in basic arithmetic, rivaling human-level performance on standard numerical tasks. However, little attention has been given to how these models perform when numerical expressions deviate from the prevailing conventions present in their training corpora. In this work, we investigate numerical reasoning across a wide range of numeral scripts and formats. We show that LLM accuracy drops substantially when numerical inputs are rendered in underrepresented scripts or formats, despite the underlying mathematical reasoning being identical. We further demonstrate that targeted prompting strategies, such as few-shot prompting and explicit numeral mapping, can greatly narrow this gap. Our findings highlight an overlooked challenge in multilingual numerical reasoning and provide actionable insights for working with LLMs to reliably interpret, manipulate, and generate numbers across diverse numeral scripts and formatting styles.

TL;DR: 研究提出AdSent框架，通过对抗性攻击和训练策略提升假新闻检测模型在情感操纵下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有假新闻检测模型依赖情感特征，但大型语言模型（LLMs）可能通过情感操控绕过检测，这一漏洞尚未被充分研究。

Method: 1) 利用LLMs生成基于情感的对抗样本；2) 分析情感偏移对检测性能的影响；3) 提出情感无关训练策略增强鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明情感变化显著影响检测性能（模型偏向中立文本判为真实），但AdSent在准确性和鲁棒性上优于基线模型，且能泛化到未见数据和对抗场景。

Conclusion: 情感操控是假新闻检测的关键漏洞，AdSent通过对抗训练有效缓解此问题，揭示了当前模型的情感偏见并提出解决方案。

Abstract: Misinformation and fake news have become a pressing societal challenge, driving the need for reliable automated detection methods. Prior research has highlighted sentiment as an important signal in fake news detection, either by analyzing which sentiments are associated with fake news or by using sentiment and emotion features for classification. However, this poses a vulnerability since adversaries can manipulate sentiment to evade detectors especially with the advent of large language models (LLMs). A few studies have explored adversarial samples generated by LLMs, but they mainly focus on stylistic features such as writing style of news publishers. Thus, the crucial vulnerability of sentiment manipulation remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we investigate the robustness of state-of-the-art fake news detectors under sentiment manipulation. We introduce AdSent, a sentiment-robust detection framework designed to ensure consistent veracity predictions across both original and sentiment-altered news articles. Specifically, we (1) propose controlled sentiment-based adversarial attacks using LLMs, (2) analyze the impact of sentiment shifts on detection performance. We show that changing the sentiment heavily impacts the performance of fake news detection models, indicating biases towards neutral articles being real, while non-neutral articles are often classified as fake content. (3) We introduce a novel sentiment-agnostic training strategy that enhances robustness against such perturbations. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that AdSent significantly outperforms competitive baselines in both accuracy and robustness, while also generalizing effectively to unseen datasets and adversarial scenarios.
