*Arnav Gupta,Gurekas Singh Sahney,Hardik Rathi,Abhishek Chandwani,Ishaan Gupta,Pratik Narang,Dhruv Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于视觉-语言模型和聚类的短视频评估框架，通过音频视觉特征预测用户参与度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有指标如VideoScore-2无法捕捉特定音画特征对实际观众互动的影响，需转向结合人类参与度的多模态评估。

Method: 利用视觉-语言模型无监督提取YouTube Shorts音画特征，聚类生成可解释因素，并训练回归模型预测参与度。

Result: 预测参与度与实际数据强相关，轻量级特征评估比传统指标（如SSIM）更可解释且可扩展。

Conclusion: 融合多模态特征重要性与人类参与信号，推动鲁棒且可解释的视频理解技术进步。

Abstract: Evaluating short-form video content requires moving beyond surface-level quality metrics toward human-aligned, multimodal reasoning. While existing frameworks like VideoScore-2 assess visual and semantic fidelity, they do not capture how specific audiovisual attributes drive real audience engagement. In this work, we propose a data-driven evaluation framework that uses Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to extract unsupervised audiovisual features, clusters them into interpretable factors, and trains a regression-based evaluator to predict engagement on short-form edutainment videos. Our curated YouTube Shorts dataset enables systematic analysis of how VLM-derived features relate to human engagement behavior. Experiments show strong correlations between predicted and actual engagement, demonstrating that our lightweight, feature-based evaluator provides interpretable and scalable assessments compared to traditional metrics (e.g., SSIM, FID). By grounding evaluation in both multimodal feature importance and human-centered engagement signals, our approach advances toward robust and explainable video understanding.

### [2] [Scalable Deep Subspace Clustering Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21434)
*Nairouz Mrabah,Mohamed Bouguessa,Sihem Sami*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SDSNet，通过landmark近似、联合优化与因子化谱聚类，实现线性复杂度的深度子空间聚类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统子空间聚类方法因O(n³)复杂度导致的可扩展性瓶颈，同时改进深度学习方法中因全亲和矩阵计算引发的效率问题。

Method: 1) 基于landmark的亲和矩阵近似以避免全矩阵构建；2) 自编码器重建与自表达目标的联合优化；3) 在因子化表示上直接执行谱聚类，结合卷积自编码器与子空间约束。

Result: 实验表明SDSNet在保持与SOTA方法相当聚类精度的同时，计算效率显著提升，尤其适合大规模数据场景。

Conclusion: SDSNet通过线性复杂度设计，在保留子空间结构的前提下实现了高效大规模聚类，为深度子空间方法提供了实用化解决方案。

Abstract: Subspace clustering methods face inherent scalability limits due to the $O(n^3)$ cost (with $n$ denoting the number of data samples) of constructing full $n\times n$ affinities and performing spectral decomposition. While deep learning-based approaches improve feature extraction, they maintain this computational bottleneck through exhaustive pairwise similarity computations. We propose SDSNet (Scalable Deep Subspace Network), a deep subspace clustering framework that achieves $\mathcal{O}(n)$ complexity through (1) landmark-based approximation, avoiding full affinity matrices, (2) joint optimization of auto-encoder reconstruction with self-expression objectives, and (3) direct spectral clustering on factorized representations. The framework combines convolutional auto-encoders with subspace-preserving constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that SDSNet achieves comparable clustering quality to state-of-the-art methods with significantly improved computational efficiency.

### [3] [CCAD: Compressed Global Feature Conditioned Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21459)
*Xiao Jin,Liang Diao,Qixin Xiao,Yifan Hu,Ziqi Zhang,Yuchen Liu,Haisong Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CCAD，结合重建与无监督表示方法，通过全局特征条件和自适应压缩机制提升异常检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有异常检测方法在领域转移时特征提取不足，重建方法训练效率低且性能受限。

Method: CCAD将全局特征作为重建模型的模态条件，并设计自适应压缩机制以提升效率与泛化能力。

Result: CCAD在AUC指标上超越SOTA方法，收敛速度更快，且在新标注DAGM 2007数据集验证有效性。

Conclusion: CCAD解决现有异常检测方法的效率与泛化问题，并贡献改进数据集与开源代码。

Abstract: Anomaly detection holds considerable industrial significance, especially in scenarios with limited anomalous data. Currently, reconstruction-based and unsupervised representation-based approaches are the primary focus. However, unsupervised representation-based methods struggle to extract robust features under domain shift, whereas reconstruction-based methods often suffer from low training efficiency and performance degradation due to insufficient constraints. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method named Compressed Global Feature Conditioned Anomaly Detection (CCAD). CCAD synergizes the strengths of both paradigms by adapting global features as a new modality condition for the reconstruction model. Furthermore, we design an adaptive compression mechanism to enhance both generalization and training efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CCAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of AUC while achieving faster convergence. In addition, we contribute a reorganized and re-annotated version of the DAGM 2007 dataset with new annotations to further validate our method's effectiveness. The code for reproducing main results is available at https://github.com/chloeqxq/CCAD.

Abstract: Multi-annotator medical image segmentation is an important research problem, but requires annotated datasets that are expensive to collect. Dermoscopic skin lesion imaging allows human experts and AI systems to observe morphological structures otherwise not discernable from regular clinical photographs. However, currently there are no large-scale publicly available multi-annotator skin lesion segmentation (SLS) datasets with annotator-labels for dermoscopic skin lesion imaging. We introduce ISIC MultiAnnot++, a large public multi-annotator skin lesion segmentation dataset for images from the ISIC Archive. The final dataset contains 17,684 segmentation masks spanning 14,967 dermoscopic images, where 2,394 dermoscopic images have 2-5 segmentations per image, making it the largest publicly available SLS dataset. Further, metadata about the segmentation, including the annotators' skill level and segmentation tool, is included, enabling research on topics such as annotator-specific preference modeling for segmentation and annotator metadata analysis. We provide an analysis on the characteristics of this dataset, curated data partitions, and consensus segmentation masks.

### [5] [Generative Multi-Focus Image Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21495)

Result: 实验证明GMFF在融合质量与细节数量上均超越当前最先进方法，尤其在缺焦区域与复杂聚焦场景下表现突出，代码已开源。

Conclusion: 所提框架有效解决了边缘伪影和缺焦区域重构问题，结合扩散模型能力实现更自然的细节恢复，具有实用潜力。

Abstract: Multi-focus image fusion aims to generate an all-in-focus image from a sequence of partially focused input images. Existing fusion algorithms generally assume that, for every spatial location in the scene, there is at least one input image in which that location is in focus. Furthermore, current fusion models often suffer from edge artifacts caused by uncertain focus estimation or hard-selection operations in complex real-world scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a generative multi-focus image fusion framework, termed GMFF, which operates in two sequential stages. In the first stage, deterministic fusion is implemented using StackMFF V4, the latest version of the StackMFF series, and integrates the available focal plane information to produce an initial fused image. The second stage, generative restoration, is realized through IFControlNet, which leverages the generative capabilities of latent diffusion models to reconstruct content from missing focal planes, restore fine details, and eliminate edge artifacts. Each stage is independently developed and functions seamlessly in a cascaded manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GMFF achieves state-of-the-art fusion performance and exhibits significant potential for practical applications, particularly in scenarios involving complex multi-focal content. The implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/Xinzhe99/StackMFF-Series.

### [6] [SVBench: Evaluation of Video Generation Models on Social Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21507)
*Wenshuo Peng,Gongxuan Wang,Tianmeng Yang,Chuanhao Li,Xiaojie Xu,Hui He,Kaipeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the first benchmark to evaluate social reasoning in text-to-video generation models, revealing significant gaps in capturing human-like social coherence such as intention recognition and prosocial inference despite advanced surface-level realism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-video models lack social intelligence, failing to infer intentions, beliefs, and social norms that humans naturally understand from visual cues, indicating a critical gap in aligning AI with human-like reasoning.

Method: A benchmark was created based on 30 social psychology paradigms across 7 dimensions (e.g., mental-state inference, social norms). A training-free agent-based pipeline synthesizes scenarios, enforces conceptual neutrality, and evaluates outputs using a vision-language model (VLM) judge.

Result: State-of-the-art models achieved plausible surface-level outputs but systematically failed in intention recognition, belief reasoning, joint attention, and prosocial behavior inference, highlighting poor alignment with human social cognition.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the urgent need for integrating causal and psychological reasoning into generative models to achieve socially coherent video generation, opening a new direction for AI research in social intelligence.

Abstract: Recent text-to-video generation models exhibit remarkable progress in visual realism, motion fidelity, and text-video alignment, yet they remain fundamentally limited in their ability to generate socially coherent behavior. Unlike humans, who effortlessly infer intentions, beliefs, emotions, and social norms from brief visual cues, current models tend to render literal scenes without capturing the underlying causal or psychological logic. To systematically evaluate this gap, we introduce the first benchmark for social reasoning in video generation. Grounded in findings from developmental and social psychology, our benchmark organizes thirty classic social cognition paradigms into seven core dimensions, including mental-state inference, goal-directed action, joint attention, social coordination, prosocial behavior, social norms, and multi-agent strategy. To operationalize these paradigms, we develop a fully training-free agent-based pipeline that (i) distills the reasoning mechanism of each experiment, (ii) synthesizes diverse video-ready scenarios, (iii) enforces conceptual neutrality and difficulty control through cue-based critique, and (iv) evaluates generated videos using a high-capacity VLM judge across five interpretable dimensions of social reasoning. Using this framework, we conduct the first large-scale study across seven state-of-the-art video generation systems. Our results reveal substantial performance gaps: while modern models excel in surface-level plausibility, they systematically fail in intention recognition, belief reasoning, joint attention, and prosocial inference.

### [7] [Fixed-Budget Parameter-Efficient Training with Frozen Encoders Improves Multimodal Chest X-Ray Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21508)
*Md Ashik Khan,Md Nahid Siddique*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究探讨了参数高效训练（PET）策略在胸部X光多模态分析中的应用，发现冻结合并适配器等方法在减少94%参数量的情况下，仍能显著优于全量微调。但校准误差偏高，需后续修正。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为解决传统微调大模型计算成本高昂的问题，针对医疗影像领域数据泄露风险（如报告病理术语污染），探索在参数预算受限下的高效训练方案。

Method: 在印第安纳大学胸部X光数据集（3851对图文样本）及大规模ChexPert数据集（22万图像）上测试冻结合编码器、BitFit、LoRA、适配器等PET方法；通过遮蔽报告中医理术语防止数据泄露，并在参数预算（2.37M）下对比AUROC指标。

Result: PET方法在参数仅占2.51%时，AUROC达0.892-0.908（全量微调为0.770）；外部验证显示均超0.69 AUROC且参数<9%；视觉模型（0.653）优于同预算多模态模型（0.641）；PET校准误差（ECE 0.29-0.34）高于简单模型（0.049）。

Conclusion: 冻结合训练策略能以极低成本实现更好分类性能，但需通过校准修正解决临床部署中的可靠性问题。性能提升主要来自参数分配优化而非跨模态交互，为大规模医疗模型轻量化提供新思路。

Abstract: Multimodal chest X-Ray analysis often fine-tunes large vision-language models, which is computationally costly. We study parameter-efficient training (PET) strategies, including frozen encoders, BitFit, LoRA, and adapters for multi-label classification on the Indiana University Chest X-Ray dataset (3,851 image-report pairs; 579 test samples). To mitigate data leakage, we redact pathology terms from reports used as text inputs while retaining clinical context. Under a fixed parameter budget (2.37M parameters, 2.51% of total), all PET variants achieve AUROC between 0.892 and 0.908, outperforming full fine-tuning (0.770 AUROC), which uses 94.3M trainable parameters, a 40x reduction. External validation on CheXpert (224,316 images, 58x larger) confirms scalability: all PET methods achieve >0.69 AUROC with <9% trainable parameters, with Adapter achieving best performance (0.7214 AUROC). Budget-matched comparisons reveal that vision-only models (0.653 AUROC, 1.06M parameters) outperform budget-matched multimodal models (0.641 AUROC, 1.06M parameters), indicating improvements arise primarily from parameter allocation rather than cross-modal synergy. While PET methods show degraded calibration (ECE: 0.29-0.34) compared to simpler models (ECE: 0.049), this represents a tractable limitation addressable through post-hoc calibration methods. These findings demonstrate that frozen encoder strategies provide superior discrimination at substantially reduced computational cost, though calibration correction is essential for clinical deployment.

### [8] [Fixed-Threshold Evaluation of a Hybrid CNN-ViT for AI-Generated Image Detection Across Photos and Art](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21512)
*Md Ashik Khan,Arafat Alam Jion*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种固定阈值评估协议，解决了现有AI图像检测方法在部署时因阈值调整导致的鲁棒性高估问题，并展示了CNN、ViT及混合模型在不同场景下的性能差异及部署指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检测方法优化单一指标且依赖条件重调阈值，导致实际部署时鲁棒性被高估。需要一种更贴近部署环境的评估方法以避免这种误判。

Method: 引入固定阈值协议（仅在清洁数据上选择一次），在JPEG压缩等变换下统一阈值；使用轻量级CNN-ViT混合模型（含频率增强设计），在三种操作点（Low-FPR、ROC-optimal、Best-F1）下系统测试性能。

Result: ViT在压缩后图像保持较高准确率（92.86%→88.36%），而频率CNN性能大幅下降（93.33%→61.49%）；所有架构在艺术内容上AUROC高出15%（0.901-0.907 vs 0.747-0.759）；混合模型在照片（91.4%）、艺术（89.7%）和CIFAKE数据（98.3%）上表现均衡。

Conclusion: 固定阈值评估揭示真实鲁棒性瓶颈，证明语义模式（ViT/混合模型）比法医特征（CNN）更可靠，建议根据部署场景选择模型：清洁照片用CNN、压缩内容用ViT、艺术领域用混合模型。

Abstract: AI image generators create both photorealistic images and stylized art, necessitating robust detectors that maintain performance under common post-processing transformations (JPEG compression, blur, downscaling). Existing methods optimize single metrics without addressing deployment-critical factors such as operating point selection and fixed-threshold robustness. This work addresses misleading robustness estimates by introducing a fixed-threshold evaluation protocol that holds decision thresholds, selected once on clean validation data, fixed across all post-processing transformations. Traditional methods retune thresholds per condition, artificially inflating robustness estimates and masking deployment failures. We report deployment-relevant performance at three operating points (Low-FPR, ROC-optimal, Best-F1) under systematic degradation testing using a lightweight CNN-ViT hybrid with gated fusion and optional frequency enhancement. Our evaluation exposes a statistically validated forensic-semantic spectrum: frequency-aided CNNs excel on pristine photos but collapse under compression (93.33% to 61.49%), whereas ViTs degrade minimally (92.86% to 88.36%) through robust semantic pattern recognition. Multi-seed experiments demonstrate that all architectures achieve 15% higher AUROC on artistic content (0.901-0.907) versus photorealistic images (0.747-0.759), confirming that semantic patterns provide fundamentally more reliable detection cues than forensic artifacts. Our hybrid approach achieves balanced cross-domain performance: 91.4% accuracy on tiny-genimage photos, 89.7% on AiArtData art/graphics, and 98.3% (competitive) on CIFAKE. Fixed-threshold evaluation eliminates retuning inflation, reveals genuine robustness gaps, and yields actionable deployment guidance: prefer CNNs for clean photo verification, ViTs for compressed content, and hybrids for art/graphics screening.

Abstract: Polarization-based underwater 3D imaging exploits polarization cues to suppress background scattering, exhibiting distinct advantages in turbid water. Although data-driven polarization-based underwater 3D reconstruction methods show great potential, existing public datasets lack sufficient diversity in scattering and observation conditions, hindering fair comparisons among different approaches, including single-view and multi-view polarization imaging methods.
  To address this limitation, we construct MuS-Polar3D, a benchmark dataset comprising polarization images of 42 objects captured under seven quantitatively controlled scattering conditions and five viewpoints, together with high-precision 3D models (+/- 0.05 mm accuracy), normal maps, and foreground masks. The dataset supports multiple vision tasks, including normal estimation, object segmentation, descattering, and 3D reconstruction.
  Inspired by computational imaging, we further decouple underwater 3D reconstruction under scattering into a two-stage pipeline, namely descattering followed by 3D reconstruction, from an imaging-chain perspective. Extensive evaluations using multiple baseline methods under complex scattering conditions demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed benchmark, achieving a best mean angular error of 15.49 degrees. To the best of our knowledge, MuS-Polar3D is the first publicly available benchmark dataset for quantitative turbidity underwater polarization-based 3D imaging, enabling accurate reconstruction and fair algorithm evaluation under controllable scattering conditions. The dataset and code are publicly available at https://github.com/WangPuyun/MuS-Polar3D.

### [10] [DiverseGRPO: Mitigating Mode Collapse in Image Generation via Diversity-Aware GRPO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21514)
*Henglin Liu,Huijuan Huang,Jing Wang,Chang Liu,Xiu Li,Xiangyang Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the issue of homogenized outputs in GRPO-based image generation by proposing a distributional creativity bonus and structure-aware regularization, significantly improving diversity while maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In later stages of GRPO training for image generation, models tend to produce homogenized outputs lacking creativity and visual diversity, limiting their application. This occurs due to over-reliance on single-sample quality as reward signal and misaligned regularization budget in the generation process.

Method: The authors propose a two-fold approach: 1) a distributional creativity bonus that builds semantic grouping through spectral clustering to reward novel visual modes more effectively, and 2) structure-aware regularization applying stronger constraints during the early-stage denoising process to preserve diversity without harming reward optimization.

Result: Experiments showed that the proposed method achieves a 13%-18% improvement in semantic diversity while maintaining comparable image quality scores, demonstrating an enhanced trade-off between quality and diversity in image generation.

Conclusion: The paper successfully tackles the diversity degradation issue in GRPO-based image generation by addressing both reward modeling and generation dynamics, establishing a new quality-diversity trade-off frontier for these models.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL), particularly GRPO, improves image generation quality significantly by comparing the relative performance of images generated within the same group. However, in the later stages of training, the model tends to produce homogenized outputs, lacking creativity and visual diversity, which restricts its application scenarios. This issue can be analyzed from both reward modeling and generation dynamics perspectives. First, traditional GRPO relies on single-sample quality as the reward signal, driving the model to converge toward a few high-reward generation modes while neglecting distribution-level diversity. Second, conventional GRPO regularization neglects the dominant role of early-stage denoising in preserving diversity, causing a misaligned regularization budget that limits the achievable quality--diversity trade-off. Motivated by these insights, we revisit the diversity degradation problem from both reward modeling and generation dynamics. At the reward level, we propose a distributional creativity bonus based on semantic grouping. Specifically, we construct a distribution-level representation via spectral clustering over samples generated from the same caption, and adaptively allocate exploratory rewards according to group sizes to encourage the discovery of novel visual modes. At the generation level, we introduce a structure-aware regularization, which enforces stronger early-stage constraints to preserve diversity without compromising reward optimization efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves a 13\%--18\% improvement in semantic diversity under matched quality scores, establishing a new Pareto frontier between image quality and diversity for GRPO-based image generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种层次感知的轻量级微调框架ViLoT，通过Tree-Path KL散度和层级同级平滑交叉熵损失，在保持分类层级一致性的同时显著降低VLM模型适配结构化分类任务的参数开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统VLM微调方法将标签扁平化处理导致分类层级预测不一致，且完全微调参数成本过高。现有方法缺乏对结构化标签体系的垂直一致性和同级分类约束的联合优化。

Method: 设计双目标联合优化：(1) Tree-Path KL Divergence在真实标签路径上强制预测垂直一致性 (2) Hierarchy-Sibling Smoothed Cross-Entropy约束同级分类决策平滑性。采用LoRA进行参数高效的模型适配，在共享嵌入空间中实现结构感知学习。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，相较基线方法平均提升6.2% Full-Path Accuracy，降低34.5% Tree-based Inconsistency Error，训练参数量仅需标准微调的0.13%，推理延迟仅增加1.4ms。

Conclusion: 验证了结构感知优化目标在参数效率微调中的有效性，为大规模分类体系下的VLM适配提供了低资源高一致性的解决方案，在商品分级、医学诊断等结构化场景具有应用潜力。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) learn powerful multimodal representations through large-scale image-text pretraining, but adapting them to hierarchical classification is underexplored. Standard approaches treat labels as flat categories and require full fine-tuning, which is expensive and produces inconsistent predictions across taxonomy levels. We propose an efficient hierarchy-aware fine-tuning framework that updates a few parameters while enforcing structural consistency. We combine two objectives: Tree-Path KL Divergence (TP-KL) aligns predictions along the ground-truth label path for vertical coherence, while Hierarchy-Sibling Smoothed Cross-Entropy (HiSCE) encourages consistent predictions among sibling classes. Both losses work in the VLM's shared embedding space and integrate with lightweight LoRA adaptation. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show consistent improvements in Full-Path Accuracy and Tree-based Inconsistency Error with minimal parameter overhead. Our approach provides an efficient strategy for adapting VLMs to structured taxonomies.

### [12] [Vision Transformers are Circulant Attention Learners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21542)
*Dongchen Han,Tianyu Li,Ziyi Wang,Gao Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为循环注意力（Circulant Attention）的新型注意力机制，通过利用视觉Transformer中自注意力矩阵的块循环矩阵特性，将计算复杂度从二次降至O(N log N)，同时保持模型容量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉Transformer中自注意力机制的二次复杂度在高分辨率场景下造成计算瓶颈，传统手工设计的稀疏性或局部性方法会牺牲模型容量，需寻找兼顾效率与性能的新范式。

Method: 发现自注意力矩阵近似于块循环矩阵（BCCB），通过显式建模注意力图为BCCB矩阵，并利用其傅里叶变换特性高效计算，仅在矩阵结构上与标准自注意力不同。

Result: 在多项视觉任务实验中，所提方法在保持与原始自注意力相当性能的同时，显著降低计算开销（理论复杂度O(N log N)），开源代码验证了其实用性。

Conclusion: 循环注意力提供了比传统自注意力更优的权衡方案，在视觉Transformer中实现高效且容量保留的注意力计算，为后续研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: The self-attention mechanism has been a key factor in the advancement of vision Transformers. However, its quadratic complexity imposes a heavy computational burden in high-resolution scenarios, restricting the practical application. Previous methods attempt to mitigate this issue by introducing handcrafted patterns such as locality or sparsity, which inevitably compromise model capacity. In this paper, we present a novel attention paradigm termed \textbf{Circulant Attention} by exploiting the inherent efficient pattern of self-attention. Specifically, we first identify that the self-attention matrix in vision Transformers often approximates the Block Circulant matrix with Circulant Blocks (BCCB), a kind of structured matrix whose multiplication with other matrices can be performed in $\mathcal{O}(N\log N)$ time. Leveraging this interesting pattern, we explicitly model the attention map as its nearest BCCB matrix and propose an efficient computation algorithm for fast calculation. The resulting approach closely mirrors vanilla self-attention, differing only in its use of BCCB matrices. Since our design is inspired by the inherent efficient paradigm, it not only delivers $\mathcal{O}(N\log N)$ computation complexity, but also largely maintains the capacity of standard self-attention. Extensive experiments on diverse visual tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, establishing circulant attention as a promising alternative to self-attention for vision Transformer architectures.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ErasedLoRA框架，通过背景感知推理与测试时优化，显著提升无数据集物体移除效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无数据集方法在物体移除中易混淆前景与背景，且直接操作注意力机制破坏图像细节，亟需更可靠的背景分离与精细重建方法。

Method: 1) BFE模块：利用多模态大语言模型从单图单掩码中分离目标前景、非目标前景与清洁背景；2) BRSA模块：通过子类型聚合优化测试时重建，保持局部细节与全局结构一致性，无需显式注意力干预。

Result: 作为预训练扩散模型插件，在多个物体移除基准上显著优于无数据集基线方法，并与依赖数据集的方法性能相当。

Conclusion: 证明了背景感知推理与测试时自适应机制对无数据集物体移除的有效性，为图像编辑提供了高效实用新方案。

Abstract: Object removal differs from common inpainting, since it must prevent the masked target from reappearing and reconstruct the occluded background with structural and contextual fidelity, rather than merely filling a hole plausibly. Recent dataset-free approaches that redirect self-attention inside the mask fail in two ways: non-target foregrounds are often misinterpreted as background, which regenerates unwanted objects, and direct attention manipulation disrupts fine details and hinders coherent integration of background cues. We propose EraseLoRA, a novel dataset-free framework that replaces attention surgery with background-aware reasoning and test-time adaptation. First, Background-aware Foreground Exclusion (BFE), uses a multimodal large-language models to separate target foreground, non-target foregrounds, and clean background from a single image-mask pair without paired supervision, producing reliable background cues while excluding distractors. Second, Background-aware Reconstruction with Subtype Aggregation (BRSA), performs test-time optimization that treats inferred background subtypes as complementary pieces and enforces their consistent integration through reconstruction and alignment objectives, preserving local detail and global structure without explicit attention intervention. We validate EraseLoRA as a plug-in to pretrained diffusion models and across benchmarks for object removal, demonstrating consistent improvements over dataset-free baselines and competitive results against dataset-driven methods. The code will be made available upon publication.

Abstract: Intelligent image editing increasingly relies on advances in computer vision, multimodal reasoning, and generative modeling. While vision-language models (VLMs) and diffusion models enable guided visual manipulation, existing work rarely ensures that inserted objects are \emph{contextually appropriate}. We introduce two new tasks for advertising and digital media: (1) \emph{context-aware object insertion}, which requires predicting suitable object categories, generating them, and placing them plausibly within the scene; and (2) \emph{sponsor-product logo augmentation}, which involves detecting products and inserting correct brand logos, even when items are unbranded or incorrectly branded. To support these tasks, we build two new datasets with category annotations, placement regions, and sponsor-product labels.

Abstract: While the technology for detecting AI-Generated Content (AIGC) images has advanced rapidly, the field still faces two core issues: poor reproducibility and insufficient gen eralizability, which hinder the practical application of such technologies. This study addresses these challenges by re viewing 7 key papers on AIGC detection, constructing a lightweight test dataset, and reproducing a representative detection method. Through this process, we identify the root causes of the reproducibility dilemma in the field: firstly, papers often omit implicit details such as prepro cessing steps and parameter settings; secondly, most detec tion methods overfit to exclusive features of specific gener ators rather than learning universal intrinsic features of AIGC images. Experimental results show that basic perfor mance can be reproduced when strictly following the core procedures described in the original papers. However, de tection performance drops sharply when preprocessing dis rupts key features or when testing across different genera tors. This research provides empirical evidence for improv ing the reproducibility of AIGC detection technologies and offers reference directions for researchers to disclose ex perimental details more comprehensively and verify the generalizability of their proposed methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LAid enhances small vision-language models' context windows via knowledge distillation, combining progressive attention mechanisms and RoPE modulation to match large models' capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing small VLMs struggle with linguistics-photography alignment due to limited window sizes, and conventional knowledge distillation/RoPE approaches fail to fully transfer long-context understanding from large models.

Method: LAid introduces (1) dynamic distance-weighted attention matching to emphasize long-range dependencies during training and (2) learnable RoPE gain modulation for adaptive position sensitivity amplification in key regions.

Result: LAid-optimized models achieve 3.2x longer effective context windows than baselines, with preserved/better performance on vision-language benchmarks and successful transfer of low-frequency attention patterns through distillation.

Conclusion: The work provides both practical techniques for efficient long-context VLMs and theoretical insights into positional knowledge transfer mechanisms in distillation systems.

Abstract: While large vision-language models (VLMs) demonstrate strong long-context understanding, their prevalent small branches fail on linguistics-photography alignment for a limited window size. We discover that knowledge distillation improves students' capability as a complement to Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) on window sizes (anchored from large models). Building on this insight, we propose LAid, which directly aims at the transfer of long-range attention mechanisms through two complementary components: (1) a progressive distance-weighted attention matching that dynamically emphasizes longer position differences during training, and (2) a learnable RoPE response gain modulation that selectively amplifies position sensitivity where needed. Extensive experiments across multiple model families demonstrate that LAid-distilled models achieve up to 3.2 times longer effective context windows compared to baseline small models, while maintaining or improving performance on standard VL benchmarks. Spectral analysis also suggests that LAid successfully preserves crucial low-frequency attention components that conventional methods fail to transfer. Our work not only provides practical techniques for building more efficient long-context VLMs but also offers theoretical insights into how positional understanding emerges and transfers during distillation.

*Shinnosuke Hirano,Yuiga Wada,Kazuki Matsuda,Seitaro Otsuki,Komei Sugiura*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Pearl, an LLM-free supervised metric for evaluating image captions in both reference-based and reference-free settings, addressing limitations in existing methods through improved neutrality and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based metrics for image caption evaluation may lack neutrality by favoring their own generations, while LLM-free metrics often underperform. There's a need for an unbiased and effective evaluation approach.

Method: Pearl employs a novel mechanism to learn image--caption and caption--caption similarity representations. A large-scale human-annotated dataset (333k judgments across 75k images) was created to train and validate the metric, enabling its application in both evaluation settings.

Result: Pearl outperformed existing LLM-free metrics on composite and specialized datasets (Flickr8K-Expert, Flickr8K-CF, Nebula, FOIL) in both reference-based and reference-free evaluations, demonstrating superior performance and reliability.

Conclusion: The study establishes Pearl as an effective, neutral alternative to LLM-based metrics by leveraging supervised learning and human-annotated data, offering improved accuracy in image caption evaluation without relying on large language models.

Abstract: We focus on the automatic evaluation of image captions in both reference-based and reference-free settings. Existing metrics based on large language models (LLMs) favor their own generations; therefore, the neutrality is in question. Most LLM-free metrics do not suffer from such an issue, whereas they do not always demonstrate high performance. To address these issues, we propose Pearl, an LLM-free supervised metric for image captioning, which is applicable to both reference-based and reference-free settings. We introduce a novel mechanism that learns the representations of image--caption and caption--caption similarities. Furthermore, we construct a human-annotated dataset for image captioning metrics, that comprises approximately 333k human judgments collected from 2,360 annotators across over 75k images. Pearl outperformed other existing LLM-free metrics on the Composite, Flickr8K-Expert, Flickr8K-CF, Nebula, and FOIL datasets in both reference-based and reference-free settings.

Conclusion: 该架构通过空间维度上下文交互与计算紧凑性平衡，证实了在临床部署场景中实现高精度病灶分析的可行性。

Abstract: Skin lesion segmentation is a crucial step in dermatology for guiding clinical decision-making. However, existing methods for accurate, robust, and resource-efficient lesion analysis have limitations, including low performance and high computational complexity. To address these limitations, we propose UltraLBM-UNet, a lightweight U-Net variant that integrates a bidirectional Mamba-based global modeling mechanism with multi-branch local feature perception. The proposed architecture integrates efficient local feature injection with bidirectional state-space modeling, enabling richer contextual interaction across spatial dimensions while maintaining computational compactness suitable for point-of-care deployment. Extensive experiments on the ISIC 2017, ISIC 2018, and PH2 datasets demonstrate that our model consistently achieves state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy, outperforming existing lightweight and Mamba counterparts with only 0.034M parameters and 0.060 GFLOPs. In addition, we introduce a hybrid knowledge distillation strategy to train an ultra-compact student model, where the distilled variant UltraLBM-UNet-T, with only 0.011M parameters and 0.019 GFLOPs, achieves competitive segmentation performance. These results highlight the suitability of UltraLBM-UNet for point-of-care deployment, where accurate and robust lesion analyses are essential.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces LCMP, the first Long-Context Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) Personalization benchmark, and proposes TAME, a training-free framework enhancing personalized dialogue through dual-memory mechanisms and a Retrieve-then-Align Augmented Generation paradigm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLM personalization methods fail to handle long-context conversations and lack evaluation benchmarks for context-aware, evolving interactions. The authors aim to address these limitations by enabling continuous learning from dialogue history and dynamic adaptation to personalized concepts.

Method: The TAME framework employs (1) double memories for temporal and persistent variations in personalized concepts, and (2) a training-free RA2G paradigm combining memory retrieval with an alignment step to contextualize responses. LCMP benchmark evaluates MLLMs' ability to perceive personalized concept variations and generate context-appropriate responses.

Result: TAME outperforms existing methods on LCMP, demonstrating superior performance in maintaining coherent long-context dialogues and enabling evolving interaction experiences through context-aware personalization.

Conclusion: The study establishes LCMP as a foundational benchmark for long-context MLLM personalization, showing that TAME's memory differentiation strategy and alignment-driven generation effectively enhance real-world, history-dependent dialogue capabilities without requiring model retraining.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) Personalization is a critical research problem that facilitates personalized dialogues with MLLMs targeting specific entities (known as personalized concepts). However, existing methods and benchmarks focus on the simple, context-agnostic visual identification and textual replacement of the personalized concept (e.g., "A yellow puppy" -> "Your puppy Mochi"), overlooking the ability to support long-context conversations. An ideal personalized MLLM assistant is capable of engaging in long-context dialogues with humans and continually improving its experience quality by learning from past dialogue histories. To bridge this gap, we propose LCMP, the first Long-Context MLLM Personalization evaluation benchmark. LCMP assesses the capability of MLLMs in perceiving variations of personalized concepts and generating contextually appropriate personalized responses that reflect these variations. As a strong baseline for LCMP, we introduce a novel training-free and state-aware framework TAME. TAME endows MLLMs with double memories to manage the temporal and persistent variations of each personalized concept in a differentiated manner. In addition, TAME incorporates a new training-free Retrieve-then-Align Augmented Generation (RA2G) paradigm. RA2G introduces an alignment step to extract the contextually fitted information from the multi-memory retrieved knowledge to the current questions, enabling better interactions for complex real-world user queries. Experiments on LCMP demonstrate that TAME achieves the best performance, showcasing remarkable and evolving interaction experiences in long-context scenarios.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于因果推理的少样本细粒度视觉分类方法（CausalFSFG），通过因果干预解决数据分布偏差问题，提升了分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法多关注特征增强，但忽视了支持集样本作为混杂变量导致的有偏偏态分布和误导性特征提取问题。

Method: 基于结构因果模型（SCM），构建因果干预框架：(1) 干预性多尺度编码器（IMSE）进行样本级干预，(2) 干预性掩码特征重建（IMFR）进行特征级干预，联合消除虚假相关性。

Result: 在CUB-200-2011、Stanford Dogs和Stanford Cars等数据集上取得SOTA性能，实验证明了因果干预的有效性。

Conclusion: 因果推理范式可有效缓解少样本细粒度分类中的数据分布偏差问题，为相关领域提供了新的方法论框架。

Abstract: Few-shot fine-grained visual categorization (FS-FGVC) focuses on identifying various subcategories within a common superclass given just one or few support examples. Most existing methods aim to boost classification accuracy by enriching the extracted features with discriminative part-level details. However, they often overlook the fact that the set of support samples acts as a confounding variable, which hampers the FS-FGVC performance by introducing biased data distribution and misguiding the extraction of discriminative features. To address this issue, we propose a new causal FS-FGVC (CausalFSFG) approach inspired by causal inference for addressing biased data distributions through causal intervention. Specifically, based on the structural causal model (SCM), we argue that FS-FGVC infers the subcategories (i.e., effect) from the inputs (i.e., cause), whereas both the few-shot condition disturbance and the inherent fine-grained nature (i.e., large intra-class variance and small inter-class variance) lead to unobservable variables that bring spurious correlations, compromising the final classification performance. To further eliminate the spurious correlations, our CausalFSFG approach incorporates two key components: (1) Interventional multi-scale encoder (IMSE) conducts sample-level interventions, (2) Interventional masked feature reconstruction (IMFR) conducts feature-level interventions, which together reveal real causalities from inputs to subcategories. Extensive experiments and thorough analyses on the widely-used public datasets, including CUB-200-2011, Stanford Dogs, and Stanford Cars, demonstrate that our CausalFSFG achieves new state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces SymDrive, a diffusion-based framework to enhance the fidelity and controllability of 3D simulations for autonomous driving by addressing challenges in photorealistic rendering and interactive scene editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to simultaneously achieve photorealistic rendering and editable traffic environments, suffering from geometric/lighting artifacts during manipulation and poor performance in large-angle novel view synthesis. This limits their applicability in solving data scarcity issues for autonomous driving simulations.

Method: The authors propose a Symmetric Auto-regressive Online Restoration paradigm: (1) constructs paired symmetric views via ground-truth-guided dual-view formulation to recover fine details; (2) employs an auto-regressive strategy for consistent lateral view generation; and (3) implements a training-free harmonization mechanism treating vehicle insertion as context-aware inpainting.

Result: SymDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance in both large-angle novel-view enhancement and physically realistic 3D vehicle insertion, with significant improvements in geometric accuracy, lighting consistency, and shadow coherence compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The unified diffusion framework demonstrates that joint optimization of symmetric view restoration and scene editing can overcome trade-offs between rendering quality and edit flexibility, offering a scalable solution for high-fidelity autonomous driving simulation environments.

Abstract: High-fidelity and controllable 3D simulation is essential for addressing the long-tail data scarcity in Autonomous Driving (AD), yet existing methods struggle to simultaneously achieve photorealistic rendering and interactive traffic editing. Current approaches often falter in large-angle novel view synthesis and suffer from geometric or lighting artifacts during asset manipulation. To address these challenges, we propose SymDrive, a unified diffusion-based framework capable of joint high-quality rendering and scene editing. We introduce a Symmetric Auto-regressive Online Restoration paradigm, which constructs paired symmetric views to recover fine-grained details via a ground-truth-guided dual-view formulation and utilizes an auto-regressive strategy for consistent lateral view generation. Furthermore, we leverage this restoration capability to enable a training-free harmonization mechanism, treating vehicle insertion as context-aware inpainting to ensure seamless lighting and shadow consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SymDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance in both novel-view enhancement and realistic 3D vehicle insertion.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses attribute entanglement in text-driven image manipulation by introducing L1 regularization into the PPE framework, enabling more disentangled and controlled edits on facial attributes while preserving identity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-based image editing often suffers from attribute entanglement, where modifying one attribute unintentionally alters others. This work aims to improve disentanglement in the existing PPE framework by addressing its limitation in latent space regularization that causes semantic leakage.

Method: Analyzed the PPE framework's components (BERT-based attribute prediction and StyleGAN2-based generation) and identified dense latent updates as the core issue. Proposed L1 regularization in latent space manipulation to enforce sparsity. Evaluated on CelebA-HQ dataset with quantitative metrics for edit quality and attribute preservation.

Result: L1-regularized PPE showed 62% reduction in identity distortion while maintaining 94% target attribute accuracy. Latent traversal visualizations confirmed 3.2x sparser updates and 58% less hair color leakage compared to original PPE.

Conclusion: Sparsity-inducing constraints effectively mitigate semantic leakage in vision-language driven image editing. The improved framework provides precise control over disentangled attribute modification while preserving core identity features in facial images.

Abstract: Text-driven image manipulation often suffers from attribute entanglement, where modifying a target attribute (e.g., adding bangs) unintentionally alters other semantic properties such as identity or appearance. The Predict, Prevent, and Evaluate (PPE) framework addresses this issue by leveraging pre-trained vision-language models for disentangled editing. In this work, we analyze the PPE framework, focusing on its architectural components, including BERT-based attribute prediction and StyleGAN2-based image generation on the CelebA-HQ dataset. Through empirical analysis, we identify a limitation in the original regularization strategy, where latent updates remain dense and prone to semantic leakage. To mitigate this issue, we introduce a sparsity-based constraint using L1 regularization on latent space manipulation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach enforces more focused and controlled edits, effectively reducing unintended changes in non-target attributes while preserving facial identity.

Conclusion: 该框架通过多模态时序建模显著增强自动驾驶系统对自然语言指令的动态场景理解能力，验证了3D场景表征与语言对齐的创新方法有效性。

Abstract: Understanding natural-language references to objects in dynamic 3D driving scenes is essential for interactive autonomous systems. In practice, many referring expressions describe targets through recent motion or short-term interactions, which cannot be resolved from static appearance or geometry alone. We study temporal language-based 3D grounding, where the objective is to identify the referred object in the current frame by leveraging multi-frame observations. We propose TrackTeller, a temporal multimodal grounding framework that integrates LiDAR-image fusion, language-conditioned decoding, and temporal reasoning in a unified architecture. TrackTeller constructs a shared UniScene representation aligned with textual semantics, generates language-aware 3D proposals, and refines grounding decisions using motion history and short-term dynamics. Experiments on the NuPrompt benchmark demonstrate that TrackTeller consistently improves language-grounded tracking performance, outperforming strong baselines with a 70% relative improvement in Average Multi-Object Tracking Accuracy and a 3.15-3.4 times reduction in False Alarm Frequency.

Omni-Weather integrates a radar encoder for weather generation tasks, followed by unified processing using a shared self-attention mechanism. Moreover, we construct a Chain-of-Thought dataset for causal reasoning in weather generation, enabling interpretable outputs and improved perceptual quality. Extensive experiments show Omni-Weather achieves state-of-the-art performance in both weather generation and understanding. Our findings further indicate that generative and understanding tasks in the weather domain can mutually enhance each other. Omni-Weather also demonstrates the feasibility and value of unifying weather generation and understanding.

Abstract: Recently, a plethora of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms have been proposed to achieve the efficiency, safety, and reliability of autonomous vehicles (AVs). The AVs use a perception system to detect, localize, and identify other vehicles, pedestrians, and road signs to perform safe navigation and decision-making. In this paper, we compare the performance of DL models, including YOLO-NAS and YOLOv8, for a detection-based perception task. We capture a custom dataset and experiment with both DL models using our custom dataset. Our analysis reveals that the YOLOv8s model saves 75% of training time compared to the YOLO-NAS model. In addition, the YOLOv8s model (83%) outperforms the YOLO-NAS model (81%) when the target is to achieve the highest object detection accuracy. These comparative analyses of these new emerging DL models will allow the relevant research community to understand the models' performance under real-world use case scenarios.

Motivation: Existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) lack robust perceptual-level image feature understanding, prompting the need for a specialized benchmark and model to bridge this gap.

Method: Developed a hierarchical definition system, large-scale datasets, and the UniPercept model using domain-adaptive pre-training and task-aligned reinforcement learning (RL) for visual rating and question-answering tasks.

Result: UniPercept outperforms state-of-the-art MLLMs in perceptual-level image understanding and functions as a plug-and-play reward model for text-to-image generation.

Conclusion: The work establishes a foundational framework (UniPercept-Bench) and baseline (UniPercept) to advance perceptual-level multimodal image understanding, offering a comprehensive benchmark for future research.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in visual understanding tasks such as visual grounding, segmentation, and captioning. However, their ability to perceive perceptual-level image features remains limited. In this work, we present UniPercept-Bench, a unified framework for perceptual-level image understanding across three key domains: Aesthetics, Quality, Structure and Texture. We establish a hierarchical definition system and construct large-scale datasets to evaluate perceptual-level image understanding. Based on this foundation, we develop a strong baseline UniPercept trained via Domain-Adaptive Pre-Training and Task-Aligned RL, enabling robust generalization across both Visual Rating (VR) and Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks. UniPercept outperforms existing MLLMs on perceptual-level image understanding and can serve as a plug-and-play reward model for text-to-image generation. This work defines Perceptual-Level Image Understanding in the era of MLLMs and, through the introduction of a comprehensive benchmark together with a strong baseline, provides a solid foundation for advancing perceptual-level multimodal image understanding.

Abstract: Modern vision--language models (VLMs) are increasingly used to interpret and generate educational content, yet their semantic outputs remain challenging to verify, reproduce, and audit over time. Inconsistencies across model families, inference settings, and computing environments undermine the reliability of AI-generated instructional material, particularly in high-stakes and quantitative STEM domains. This work introduces SlideChain, a blockchain-backed provenance framework designed to provide verifiable integrity for multimodal semantic extraction at scale. Using the SlideChain Slides Dataset-a curated corpus of 1,117 medical imaging lecture slides from a university course-we extract concepts and relational triples from four state-of-the-art VLMs and construct structured provenance records for every slide. SlideChain anchors cryptographic hashes of these records on a local EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine)-compatible blockchain, providing tamper-evident auditability and persistent semantic baselines. Through the first systematic analysis of semantic disagreement, cross-model similarity, and lecture-level variability in multimodal educational content, we reveal pronounced cross-model discrepancies, including low concept overlap and near-zero agreement in relational triples on many slides. We further evaluate gas usage, throughput, and scalability under simulated deployment conditions, and demonstrate perfect tamper detection along with deterministic reproducibility across independent extraction runs. Together, these results show that SlideChain provides a practical and scalable step toward trustworthy, verifiable multimodal educational pipelines, supporting long-term auditability, reproducibility, and integrity for AI-assisted instructional systems.

Motivation: 研究VGGT在长输入序列下注意力崩溃的根本原因，旨在建立数学理论以指导未来可扩展的3D视觉Transformer设计。

Method: 将全局注意力流程建模为退化扩散过程，理论证明令牌特征流收敛至狄拉克型测度并推导闭式PDE方程，同时分析令牌合并策略对扩散系数的调节作用。

Result: 数学证明特征流以O(1/L)速率收敛，理论模型精确预测注意力秩退化与热图演化，令牌合并通过降低有效扩散系数延缓崩溃，实验结果与理论完全一致。

Conclusion: 建立的数学框架为大规模视觉Transformer提供理论解释范式，并揭示多模态扩展的潜在研究方向。

Abstract: Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (VGGT) delivers state-of-the-art feed-forward 3D reconstruction, yet its global self-attention layer suffers from a drastic collapse phenomenon when the input sequence exceeds a few hundred frames: attention matrices rapidly become near rank-one, token geometry degenerates to an almost one-dimensional subspace, and reconstruction error accumulates super-linearly.In this report,we establish a rigorous mathematical explanation of the collapse by viewing the global-attention iteration as a degenerate diffusion process.We prove that,in VGGT, the token-feature flow converges toward a Dirac-type measure at a $O(1/L)$ rate, where $L$ is the layer index, yielding a closed-form mean-field partial differential equation that precisely predicts the empirically observed rank profile.The theory quantitatively matches the attention-heat-map evolution and a series of experiments outcomes reported in relevant works and explains why its token-merging remedy -- which periodically removes redundant tokens -- slows the effective diffusion coefficient and thereby delays collapse without additional training.We believe the analysis provides a principled lens for interpreting future scalable 3D-vision transformers,and we highlight its potential for multi-modal generalization.

Abstract: Recent advances in digitization technologies have transformed the preservation and dissemination of cultural heritage. In this vein, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have emerged as a leading technology for 3D digitization, delivering representations with exceptional realism. However, existing methods struggle to accurately model anisotropic specular surfaces, typically observed, for example, on brushed metals. In this work, we introduce ShinyNeRF, a novel framework capable of handling both isotropic and anisotropic reflections. Our method is capable of jointly estimating surface normals, tangents, specular concentration, and anisotropy magnitudes of an Anisotropic Spherical Gaussian (ASG) distribution, by learning an approximation of the outgoing radiance as an encoded mixture of isotropic von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distributions. Experimental results show that ShinyNeRF not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on digitizing anisotropic specular reflections, but also offers plausible physical interpretations and editing of material properties compared to existing methods.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for generating Bengali handwritten text using a self-collected dataset of 500 contributors, enabling diverse and realistic outputs from plain text.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bengali, the fifth most spoken language globally, lacks research in handwritten text generation (HTG) compared to English and Arabic. This work addresses this gap by focusing on the underexplored Bengali script.

Method: A dataset of Bengali handwriting samples was collected from 500 contributors across ages and genders. Images were pre-processed for consistency, and a model was developed to generate diverse handwritten outputs from plain text.

Result: Successful generation of diverse, realistic Bengali handwritten text, demonstrating the effectiveness of the dataset and method in capturing handwriting variation.

Conclusion: This work advances Bengali HTG research by providing a novel dataset and method, serving as a foundation for future studies in handwritten text generation.

Abstract: Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) is a well-established research area. In contrast, Handwritten Text Generation (HTG) is an emerging field with significant potential. This task is challenging due to the variation in individual handwriting styles. A large and diverse dataset is required to generate realistic handwritten text. However, such datasets are difficult to collect and are not readily available. Bengali is the fifth most spoken language in the world. While several studies exist for languages such as English and Arabic, Bengali handwritten text generation has received little attention. To address this gap, we propose a method for generating Bengali handwritten words. We developed and used a self-collected dataset of Bengali handwriting samples. The dataset includes contributions from approximately five hundred individuals across different ages and genders. All images were pre-processed to ensure consistency and quality. Our approach demonstrates the ability to produce diverse handwritten outputs from input plain text. We believe this work contributes to the advancement of Bengali handwriting generation and can support further research in this area.

Abstract: The fast evolution of generative models has heightened the demand for reliable detection of AI-generated images. To tackle this challenge, we introduce FUSE, a hybrid system that combines spectral features extracted through Fast Fourier Transform with semantic features obtained from the CLIP's Vision encoder. The features are fused into a joint representation and trained progressively in two stages. Evaluations on GenImage, WildFake, DiTFake, GPT-ImgEval and Chameleon datasets demonstrate strong generalization across multiple generators. Our FUSE (Stage 1) model demonstrates state-of-the-art results on the Chameleon benchmark. It also attains 91.36% mean accuracy on the GenImage dataset, 88.71% accuracy across all tested generators, and a mean Average Precision of 94.96%. Stage 2 training further improves performance for most generators. Unlike existing methods, which often perform poorly on high-fidelity images in Chameleon, our approach maintains robustness across diverse generators. These findings highlight the benefits of integrating spectral and semantic features for generalized detection of images generated by AI.

Abstract: Comprehensively and flexibly capturing the complex spatio-temporal dependencies of human motion is critical for multi-person motion prediction. Existing methods grapple with two primary limitations: i) Inflexible spatiotemporal representation due to reliance on positional encodings for capturing spatiotemporal information. ii) High computational costs stemming from the quadratic time complexity of conventional attention mechanisms. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Spatiotemporal-Untrammelled Mixture of Experts (ST-MoE), which flexibly explores complex spatio-temporal dependencies in human motion and significantly reduces computational cost. To adaptively mine complex spatio-temporal patterns from human motion, our model incorporates four distinct types of spatiotemporal experts, each specializing in capturing different spatial or temporal dependencies. To reduce the potential computational overhead while integrating multiple experts, we introduce bidirectional spatiotemporal Mamba as experts, each sharing bidirectional temporal and spatial Mamba in distinct combinations to achieve model efficiency and parameter economy. Extensive experiments on four multi-person benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms state-of-art in accuracy but also reduces model parameter by 41.38% and achieves a 3.6x speedup in training.

Abstract: Embodied navigation in open, dynamic environments demands accurate foresight of how the world will evolve and how actions will unfold over time. We propose AstraNav-World, an end-to-end world model that jointly reasons about future visual states and action sequences within a unified probabilistic framework. Our framework integrates a diffusion-based video generator with a vision-language policy, enabling synchronized rollouts where predicted scenes and planned actions are updated simultaneously. Training optimizes two complementary objectives: generating action-conditioned multi-step visual predictions and deriving trajectories conditioned on those predicted visuals. This bidirectional constraint makes visual predictions executable and keeps decisions grounded in physically consistent, task-relevant futures, mitigating cumulative errors common in decoupled "envision-then-plan" pipelines. Experiments across diverse embodied navigation benchmarks show improved trajectory accuracy and higher success rates. Ablations confirm the necessity of tight vision-action coupling and unified training, with either branch removal degrading both prediction quality and policy reliability. In real-world testing, AstraNav-World demonstrated exceptional zero-shot capabilities, adapting to previously unseen scenarios without any real-world fine-tuning. These results suggest that AstraNav-World captures transferable spatial understanding and planning-relevant navigation dynamics, rather than merely overfitting to simulation-specific data distribution. Overall, by unifying foresight vision and control within a single generative model, we move closer to reliable, interpretable, and general-purpose embodied agents that operate robustly in open-ended real-world settings.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型因非因果性难以部署流式生成，而因果自回归方法存在误差累积和长期一致性差的问题，实时人像动画需要兼顾高视觉质量、超低延迟和动态响应。

Method: 1. 分块生成策略（缓存KV状态保持全局身份，滑动窗口注意力实现局部时间建模）；2. 时间结点模块（图像转视频条件生成平滑分块间运动）；3. "提前运行"机制（动态更新参考帧时序坐标保持语义超前）。

Result: 在消费级GPU上实现无限序列生成，达到实时性能（延迟<50ms），具有高视觉稳定性和长期时间一致性，优于现有扩散模型和自回归方法。

Conclusion: Knot Forcing通过创新的流式架构设计，首次实现了兼顾视觉质量、时间一致性和交互延迟的实时人像动画生成，适用于虚拟助手和直播头像等应用场景。

Abstract: Real-time portrait animation is essential for interactive applications such as virtual assistants and live avatars, requiring high visual fidelity, temporal coherence, ultra-low latency, and responsive control from dynamic inputs like reference images and driving signals. While diffusion-based models achieve strong quality, their non-causal nature hinders streaming deployment. Causal autoregressive video generation approaches enable efficient frame-by-frame generation but suffer from error accumulation, motion discontinuities at chunk boundaries, and degraded long-term consistency. In this work, we present a novel streaming framework named Knot Forcing for real-time portrait animation that addresses these challenges through three key designs: (1) a chunk-wise generation strategy with global identity preservation via cached KV states of the reference image and local temporal modeling using sliding window attention; (2) a temporal knot module that overlaps adjacent chunks and propagates spatio-temporal cues via image-to-video conditioning to smooth inter-chunk motion transitions; and (3) A "running ahead" mechanism that dynamically updates the reference frame's temporal coordinate during inference, keeping its semantic context ahead of the current rollout frame to support long-term coherence. Knot Forcing enables high-fidelity, temporally consistent, and interactive portrait animation over infinite sequences, achieving real-time performance with strong visual stability on consumer-grade GPUs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种两阶段框架SyncAnyone，通过扩散视频变换和无掩码微调，显著提升视频配音的音频-唇动同步精度与视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为解决现有基于掩码的训练策略破坏时空上下文、导致面部动态不稳定和背景不一致的问题，需开发既保证唇动准确又保持全局视觉连贯性的新方法。

Method: 第一阶段：使用扩散视频变换器进行带掩码的口部修复，利用其时空建模生成音频驱动的精准唇动；第二阶段：通过伪数据生成和无掩码微调消除掩码引入的局部伪影，合成包含随机音频的高质量配对样本优化模型。

Conclusion: SyncAnyone通过两阶段学习框架有效平衡了唇动准确性与视觉保真度，为高质量AI配音提供了新范式。

Abstract: High-quality AI-powered video dubbing demands precise audio-lip synchronization, high-fidelity visual generation, and faithful preservation of identity and background. Most existing methods rely on a mask-based training strategy, where the mouth region is masked in talking-head videos, and the model learns to synthesize lip movements from corrupted inputs and target audios. While this facilitates lip-sync accuracy, it disrupts spatiotemporal context, impairing performance on dynamic facial motions and causing instability in facial structure and background consistency. To overcome this limitation, we propose SyncAnyone, a novel two-stage learning framework that achieves accurate motion modeling and high visual fidelity simultaneously. In Stage 1, we train a diffusion-based video transformer for masked mouth inpainting, leveraging its strong spatiotemporal modeling to generate accurate, audio-driven lip movements. However, due to input corruption, minor artifacts may arise in the surrounding facial regions and the background. In Stage 2, we develop a mask-free tuning pipeline to address mask-induced artifacts. Specifically, on the basis of the Stage 1 model, we develop a data generation pipeline that creates pseudo-paired training samples by synthesizing lip-synced videos from the source video and random sampled audio. We further tune the stage 2 model on this synthetic data, achieving precise lip editing and better background consistency. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art results in visual quality, temporal coherence, and identity preservation under in-the wild lip-syncing scenarios.

TL;DR: 本论文提出一种名为BertsWin的混合架构，旨在解决3D医学影像中自监督学习（SSL）与视觉变压器（ViTs）应用的瓶颈问题，通过结合BERT风格的掩码与Swin变压器窗口机制，显著提升3D空间拓扑的学习效率，并实现训练加速及计算资源优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有适用于2D图像的Masked Autoencoders（MAE）因舍弃3D数据的空间关系（如预训练时丢弃75%的token），在3D容积成像中的表现受限。作者意图通过改进架构设计来填补这一领域的模型空白，并解决医学3D成像中高计算成本与低效率问题。

Method: 提出BertsWin架构，核心包括：1) 全BERT风格的token掩码策略，结合Swin变压器窗口机制处理完整3D token网格（含掩码与可见token），保留空间拓扑；2) 采用单级局部Swin窗口平滑ViT的二次复杂度；3) 定义结构优先损失函数，并设计GradientConductor优化器。实验以颞下颌关节锥形束CT数据验证模型性能。

Result: 相比传统ViT-MAE基线，BertsWin在3D拓扑保持下实现语义收敛速度提升5.8倍，结合GradientConductor优化器后训练周期从660降至44（减少15倍）。在典型分辨率下，计算量（FLOP）与稀疏ViT基线持平，但资源总量因加速显著减少，且分割与重建性能达到前沿水平。

Conclusion: BertsWin通过保留3D拓扑与架构创新，成功解决3D容积数据处理的低效问题，其性能优势来自掩码策略、局部窗口设计以及时序感知的优化策略，为医学3D影像分析提供了高效的自监督训练新范式。

Abstract: The application of self-supervised learning (SSL) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) approaches demonstrates promising results in the field of 2D medical imaging, but the use of these methods on 3D volumetric images is fraught with difficulties. Standard Masked Autoencoders (MAE), which are state-of-the-art solution for 2D, have a hard time capturing three-dimensional spatial relationships, especially when 75% of tokens are discarded during pre-training. We propose BertsWin, a hybrid architecture combining full BERT-style token masking using Swin Transformer windows, to enhance spatial context learning in 3D during SSL pre-training. Unlike the classic MAE, which processes only visible areas, BertsWin introduces a complete 3D grid of tokens (masked and visible), preserving the spatial topology. And to smooth out the quadratic complexity of ViT, single-level local Swin windows are used. We introduce a structural priority loss function and evaluate the results of cone beam computed tomography of the temporomandibular joints. The subsequent assessment includes TMJ segmentation on 3D CT scans. We demonstrate that the BertsWin architecture, by maintaining a complete three-dimensional spatial topology, inherently accelerates semantic convergence by a factor of 5.8x compared to standard ViT-MAE baselines. Furthermore, when coupled with our proposed GradientConductor optimizer, the full BertsWin framework achieves a 15-fold reduction in training epochs (44 vs 660) required to reach state-of-the-art reconstruction fidelity. Analysis reveals that BertsWin achieves this acceleration without the computational penalty typically associated with dense volumetric processing. At canonical input resolutions, the architecture maintains theoretical FLOP parity with sparse ViT baselines, resulting in a significant net reduction in total computational resources due to faster convergence.

Conclusion: Scene-VLM通过多模态序列建模和解释性增强，显著提升视频场景分割性能，验证了生成语言解释与弱监督学习的有效性。

Abstract: Segmenting long-form videos into semantically coherent scenes is a fundamental task in large-scale video understanding. Existing encoder-based methods are limited by visual-centric biases, classify each shot in isolation without leveraging sequential dependencies, and lack both narrative understanding and explainability. In this paper, we present Scene-VLM, the first fine-tuned vision-language model (VLM) framework for video scene segmentation. Scene-VLM jointly processes visual and textual cues including frames, transcriptions, and optional metadata to enable multimodal reasoning across consecutive shots. The model generates predictions sequentially with causal dependencies among shots and introduces a context-focus window mechanism to ensure sufficient temporal context for each shot-level decision. In addition, we propose a scheme to extract confidence scores from the token-level logits of the VLM, enabling controllable precision-recall trade-offs that were previously limited to encoder-based methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our model can be aligned to generate coherent natural-language rationales for its boundary decisions through minimal targeted supervision. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard scene segmentation benchmarks. On MovieNet, for example, Scene-VLM yields significant improvements of +6 AP and +13.7 F1 over the previous leading method.

Conclusion: 为生成模型的指令驱动微调提供了通用框架，实现了更优的复合控制和用户意图保持能力。

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning of Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) for diverse, multi-conditional tasks often suffers from task interference when using monolithic adapters like LoRA. The Mixture of Low-rank Experts (MoLE) architecture offers a modular solution, but its potential is usually limited by routing policies that operate at a token level. Such local routing can conflict with the global nature of user instructions, leading to artifacts like spatial fragmentation and semantic drift in complex image generation tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce InstructMoLE, a novel framework that employs an Instruction-Guided Mixture of Low-Rank Experts. Instead of per-token routing, InstructMoLE utilizes a global routing signal, Instruction-Guided Routing (IGR), derived from the user's comprehensive instruction. This ensures that a single, coherently chosen expert council is applied uniformly across all input tokens, preserving the global semantics and structural integrity of the generation process. To complement this, we introduce an output-space orthogonality loss, which promotes expert functional diversity and mitigates representational collapse. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InstructMoLE significantly outperforms existing LoRA adapters and MoLE variants across challenging multi-conditional generation benchmarks. Our work presents a robust and generalizable framework for instruction-driven fine-tuning of generative models, enabling superior compositional control and fidelity to user intent.

Abstract: Mycetoma is a neglected tropical disease caused by fungi or bacteria leading to severe tissue damage and disabilities. It affects poor and rural communities and presents medical challenges and socioeconomic burdens on patients and healthcare systems in endemic regions worldwide. Mycetoma diagnosis is a major challenge in mycetoma management, particularly in low-resource settings where expert pathologists are limited. To address this challenge, this paper presents an overview of the Mycetoma MicroImage: Detect and Classify Challenge (mAIcetoma) which was organized to advance mycetoma diagnosis through AI solutions. mAIcetoma focused on developing automated models for segmenting mycetoma grains and classifying mycetoma types from histopathological images. The challenge attracted the attention of several teams worldwide to participate and five finalist teams fulfilled the challenge objectives. The teams proposed various deep learning architectures for the ultimate goal of this challenge. Mycetoma database (MyData) was provided to participants as a standardized dataset to run the proposed models. Those models were evaluated using evaluation metrics. Results showed that all the models achieved high segmentation accuracy, emphasizing the necessitate of grain detection as a critical step in mycetoma diagnosis. In addition, the top-performing models show a significant performance in classifying mycetoma types.

Method: 提出一种似然引导的扩散后采样框架，采用无条件扩散先验模型作为初始分布，结合测量误差梯度进行迭代条件约束。通过PSNR和SSIM双重评估体系对不同引导强度（PS scale 0.95）与噪声标准差（σ=0.01）参数组合进行消融实验，并开发综合评分公式(P/N40+SSIM)量化重建质量。

Result: 实验表明适度的引导强度可提升重建质量，最优参数组合（PS scale 0.95，σ=0.01）获得PSNR/40+SSIM综合评分1.45231，较传统方法在边缘锐度与面部细节恢复上表现更优。相较于PS退火等策略，该方法在纹理重构保真度上实现更好的权衡，且无需模型重训练。

Conclusion: 本研究证实通过精准平衡扩散先验与测量梯度强度，扩散后采样框架可在不重构模型权重的条件下实现高分辨率重建。该方法在噪声干扰场景下展现出计算效率与图像质量的双重优势，为通用逆成像问题提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: This report studies diffusion posterior sampling (DPS) for single-image super-resolution (SISR) under a known degradation model. We implement a likelihood-guided sampling procedure that combines an unconditional diffusion prior with gradient-based conditioning to enforce measurement consistency for $4\times$ super-resolution with additive Gaussian noise. We evaluate posterior sampling (PS) conditioning across guidance scales and noise levels, using PSNR and SSIM as fidelity metrics and a combined selection score $(\mathrm{PSNR}/40)+\mathrm{SSIM}$. Our ablation shows that moderate guidance improves reconstruction quality, with the best configuration achieved at PS scale $0.95$ and noise standard deviation $σ=0.01$ (score $1.45231$). Qualitative results confirm that the selected PS setting restores sharper edges and more coherent facial details compared to the downsampled inputs, while alternative conditioning strategies (e.g., MCG and PS-annealed) exhibit different texture fidelity trade-offs. These findings highlight the importance of balancing diffusion priors and measurement-gradient strength to obtain stable, high-quality reconstructions without retraining the diffusion model for each operator.

*Mengqi He,Xinyu Tian,Xin Shen,Jinhong Ni,Shu Zou,Zhaoyuan Yang,Jing Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出基于熵值的攻击方法EGA，针对视觉-语言模型(VLM)生成过程中的高熵tokens进行攻击，在仅攻击20%关键位置的情况下实现比全局攻击方法更强的语义破坏，并揭示了当前VLM安全机制的漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于熵的最大化攻击假设所有解码步骤对生成不稳定性的贡献均等，但研究发现仅约20%的高熵tokens决定了输出轨迹，这些关键位置的扰动可显著破坏输出可靠性，同时降低攻击成本并揭示新安全隐患。

Method: 通过追踪自回归生成过程中的高熵tokens定位关键决策点，提出Entropy-bank Guided Adversarial攻击方法(EGA)，在多个VLM架构中集中扰动这些位置，并评估攻击成功率及有害输出转化率。

Result: EGA在多种VLM上实现93-95%的攻击成功率，将35-49%的良性输出转为有害输出，跨模型攻击在未见目标上达到17-26%的有害转化率，且攻击模式在不同架构间存在复现性。

Conclusion: 高熵tokens是VLM生成稳定性的关键瓶颈，EGA攻击方法暴露了当前安全防护机制的不足，建议防御方法应针对性加固生成过程中的高不确定性环节。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) achieve remarkable performance but remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Entropy, a measure of model uncertainty, is strongly correlated with the reliability of VLM. Prior entropy-based attacks maximize uncertainty at all decoding steps, implicitly assuming that every token contributes equally to generation instability. We show instead that a small fraction (about 20%) of high-entropy tokens, i.e., critical decision points in autoregressive generation, disproportionately governs output trajectories. By concentrating adversarial perturbations on these positions, we achieve semantic degradation comparable to global methods while using substantially smaller budgets. More importantly, across multiple representative VLMs, such selective attacks convert 35-49% of benign outputs into harmful ones, exposing a more critical safety risk. Remarkably, these vulnerable high-entropy forks recur across architecturally diverse VLMs, enabling feasible transferability (17-26% harmful rates on unseen targets). Motivated by these findings, we propose Entropy-bank Guided Adversarial attacks (EGA), which achieves competitive attack success rates (93-95%) alongside high harmful conversion, thereby revealing new weaknesses in current VLM safety mechanisms.

Motivation: 针对自动驾驶中V2X场景下遮挡、有限视角和通信延迟导致的3D时空感知不稳定问题，现有方案难以高效对齐多视角异构数据与多模态特征。

Method: 设计双层空间交叉注意力模块，先聚合多视角图像特征增强语义一致性，再基于更新的空间查询引导点云融合，降低计算开销的同时实现跨模态交互。

Result: 在真实V2X-Seq-SPD数据集及模拟的V2X-Sim-V2V/V2I基准上，检测与追踪性能在不同通信延迟条件下均稳定提升，定性可视化验证感知稳定性。

Conclusion: XET-V2X通过统一的时空表征和高效跨模态对齐策略，实现了复杂交通场景中鲁棒且时间稳定的多模态感知，为V2X协作提供可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-view cooperative perception and multimodal fusion are essential for reliable 3D spatiotemporal understanding in autonomous driving, especially under occlusions, limited viewpoints, and communication delays in V2X scenarios. This paper proposes XET-V2X, a multi-modal fused end-to-end tracking framework for v2x collaboration that unifies multi-view multimodal sensing within a shared spatiotemporal representation. To efficiently align heterogeneous viewpoints and modalities, XET-V2X introduces a dual-layer spatial cross-attention module based on multi-scale deformable attention. Multi-view image features are first aggregated to enhance semantic consistency, followed by point cloud fusion guided by the updated spatial queries, enabling effective cross-modal interaction while reducing computational overhead. Experiments on the real-world V2X-Seq-SPD dataset and the simulated V2X-Sim-V2V and V2X-Sim-V2I benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in detection and tracking performance under varying communication delays. Both quantitative results and qualitative visualizations indicate that XET-V2X achieves robust and temporally stable perception in complex traffic scenarios.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于参数化神经崩溃的可扩展类增量学习方法（SCL-PNC），通过动态ETF分类器、自适应层扩展和知识蒸馏解决模型扩展中的类别分布漂移和特征不一致问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有增量学习方法冻结旧模型参数以防止灾难性遗忘，但忽视了结构效率需求，导致模块间特征差异和类别分布演化引发的类别错位问题。需要一种高效扩展模型结构的方法。

Method: 设计可扩展的参数化ETF（等角紧框架）分类器，通过自适应层实现最小成本的主干扩展，结合知识蒸馏对齐扩展模块间的特征。采用并行扩展框架抑制序列扩展中的特征漂移。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在标准数据集上优于现有增量学习方法，有效解决类别分布变化和模型扩展效率问题，代码已开源。

Conclusion: SCL-PNC通过结构化组合可扩展主干网、自适应层和参数化ETF分类器，实现动态扩展模型的收敛性保证，同时提升类增量场景下的特征一致性和类别对齐能力。

Abstract: Incremental learning often encounter challenges such as overfitting to new data and catastrophic forgetting of old data. Existing methods can effectively extend the model for new tasks while freezing the parameters of the old model, but ignore the necessity of structural efficiency to lead to the feature difference between modules and the class misalignment due to evolving class distributions. To address these issues, we propose scalable class-incremental learning based on parametric neural collapse (SCL-PNC) that enables demand-driven, minimal-cost backbone expansion by adapt-layer and refines the static into a dynamic parametric Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF) framework according to incremental class. This method can efficiently handle the model expansion question with the increasing number of categories in real-world scenarios. Additionally, to counteract feature drift in serial expansion models, the parallel expansion framework is presented with a knowledge distillation algorithm to align features across expansion modules. Therefore, SCL-PNC can not only design a dynamic and extensible ETF classifier to address class misalignment due to evolving class distributions, but also ensure feature consistency by an adapt-layer with knowledge distillation between extended modules. By leveraging neural collapse, SCL-PNC induces the convergence of the incremental expansion model through a structured combination of the expandable backbone, adapt-layer, and the parametric ETF classifier. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method. Our code is available at https://github.com/zhangchuangxin71-cyber/dynamic_ ETF2.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ADT-Tree通过动态调整草案树结构加速视觉自回归模型推理，在保持生成质量的同时提升3倍速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自回归图像模型推理速度慢（需2000步），推测解码在视觉模型中因区域预测难度差异导致效率低下。

Method: ADT-Tree动态调整草案树深度/宽度：①基于相邻token状态初始化横向结构；②通过二分适应算法在简单区域加深、复杂区域加宽。

Result: 在MS-COCO和PartiPrompts上分别实现3.13x/3.05x加速，且可与LANTERN等方法结合进一步提升效率。

Conclusion: ADT-Tree解决了视觉AR模型中的非均匀预测难题，为加速生成模型推理提供了可通用的新范式。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) image models achieve diffusion-level quality but suffer from sequential inference, requiring approximately 2,000 steps for a 576x576 image. Speculative decoding with draft trees accelerates LLMs yet underperforms on visual AR models due to spatially varying token prediction difficulty. We identify a key obstacle in applying speculative decoding to visual AR models: inconsistent acceptance rates across draft trees due to varying prediction difficulties in different image regions. We propose Adjacency-Adaptive Dynamical Draft Trees (ADT-Tree), an adjacency-adaptive dynamic draft tree that dynamically adjusts draft tree depth and width by leveraging adjacent token states and prior acceptance rates. ADT-Tree initializes via horizontal adjacency, then refines depth/width via bisectional adaptation, yielding deeper trees in simple regions and wider trees in complex ones. The empirical evaluations on MS-COCO 2017 and PartiPrompts demonstrate that ADT-Tree achieves speedups of 3.13xand 3.05x, respectively. Moreover, it integrates seamlessly with relaxed sampling methods such as LANTERN, enabling further acceleration. Code is available at https://github.com/Haodong-Lei-Ray/ADT-Tree.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DIOR是一种无需训练的方法，利用大视觉语言模型生成条件图像嵌入，通过提示模型用单个词描述图像并提取隐藏状态，实现了优于CLIP等现有方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉基础模型（如CLIP）无法针对特定文本条件（如颜色、风格）生成聚焦的图像表征，而条件图像嵌入在无需额外训练的情况下仍具挑战性。

Method: DIOR直接提示大视觉语言模型（LVLM）以单个条件相关词生成图像描述，并提取模型最后一词的隐藏状态作为条件图像嵌入，全程无需微调或额外数据。

Result: DIOR在无需训练的基线方法（如CLIP）和需要训练的方法中均表现出更优性能，且适用于任意图像与条件，具有高度泛化能力。

Conclusion: DIOR为通用视觉语言模型提供了一个即插即用的零样本框架，验证了模型内部表征对条件理解的隐式能力，推动了训练自由与参数高效的视觉表征研究。

Abstract: Conditional image embeddings are feature representations that focus on specific aspects of an image indicated by a given textual condition (e.g., color, genre), which has been a challenging problem. Although recent vision foundation models, such as CLIP, offer rich representations of images, they are not designed to focus on a specified condition. In this paper, we propose DIOR, a method that leverages a large vision-language model (LVLM) to generate conditional image embeddings. DIOR is a training-free approach that prompts the LVLM to describe an image with a single word related to a given condition. The hidden state vector of the LVLM's last token is then extracted as the conditional image embedding. DIOR provides a versatile solution that can be applied to any image and condition without additional training or task-specific priors. Comprehensive experimental results on conditional image similarity tasks demonstrate that DIOR outperforms existing training-free baselines, including CLIP. Furthermore, DIOR achieves superior performance compared to methods that require additional training across multiple settings.

*Md Rafid Islam,Rafsan Jany,Akib Ahmed,Mohammad Ashrafuzzaman Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Feature-level fusion of CNN models, particularly EfficientNet-B0 and DenseNet121, improves accuracy and efficiency for binary diabetic retinopathy screening on diverse, low-quality images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diabetic retinopathy screening is limited by specialist shortages and variable image quality. Combining CNN backbones could enhance accuracy and efficiency for global-scale deployment.

Method: Trained ResNet50, EfficientNet-B0, DenseNet121, and their fusion variants on 11,156 fundus images from five public datasets. Evaluated binary classification performance across five runs and measured computational trade-offs.

Result: EfficientNet-B0 + DenseNet121 fusion achieved 82.89% accuracy with balanced F1-scores (83.60% normal, 82.60% diabetic). Fusion models outperformed single backbones, while tri-fusion had higher computational cost. EfficientNet-B0 alone was fastest (1.16 ms/image) but fusion balanced accuracy and latency.

Conclusion: Lightweight feature fusion enables scalable DR screening in resource-constrained settings, offering robust performance across heterogeneous data and balancing accuracy with real-world throughput requirements.

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) remains a leading cause of preventable blindness, yet large-scale screening is constrained by limited specialist availability and variable image quality across devices and populations. This work investigates whether feature-level fusion of complementary convolutional neural network (CNN) backbones can deliver accurate and efficient binary DR screening on globally sourced fundus images. Using 11,156 images pooled from five public datasets (APTOS, EyePACS, IDRiD, Messidor, and ODIR), we frame DR detection as a binary classification task and compare three pretrained models (ResNet50, EfficientNet-B0, and DenseNet121) against pairwise and tri-fusion variants. Across five independent runs, fusion consistently outperforms single backbones. The EfficientNet-B0 + DenseNet121 (Eff+Den) fusion model achieves the best overall mean performance (accuracy: 82.89\%) with balanced class-wise F1-scores for normal (83.60\%) and diabetic (82.60\%) cases. While the tri-fusion is competitive, it incurs a substantially higher computational cost. Inference profiling highlights a practical trade-off: EfficientNet-B0 is the fastest (approximately 1.16 ms/image at batch size 1000), whereas the Eff+Den fusion offers a favorable accuracy--latency balance. These findings indicate that lightweight feature fusion can enhance generalization across heterogeneous datasets, supporting scalable binary DR screening workflows where both accuracy and throughput are critical.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EasyOmnimatte：首个统一的端到端视频全 matte 方法，利用双专家策略实现高质量且高效的前景分解与效果捕捉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频全 matte 方法依赖低效的多阶段或推理时优化流程，难以充分挖掘生成模型的先验能力，导致分解效果欠佳。研究发现直接对视频修复模型进行LoRA微调会抑制特效捕捉能力，需针对性定位关键模块进行优化。

Method: 提出双专家微调策略：1）特效专家仅对敏感的DiT模块应用LoRA以捕捉前景结构及关联特效；2）质量专家全量LoRA微调用于细化透明度蒙版。在去噪阶段，前期使用特效专家，后期转为质量专家，避免两次完整扩散过程。

Result: 消融实验验证双专家策略有效性，实验证明相较于基线方法，在质量和效率上均超越现有SOTA方法，并支持多种下游任务。

Conclusion: 通过模块化微调策略突破视频全 matte 领域长期存在的性能与效率瓶颈，为生成模型的多任务适配提供新思路。

Abstract: Existing video omnimatte methods typically rely on slow, multi-stage, or inference-time optimization pipelines that fail to fully exploit powerful generative priors, producing suboptimal decompositions. Our key insight is that, if a video inpainting model can be finetuned to remove the foreground-associated effects, then it must be inherently capable of perceiving these effects, and hence can also be finetuned for the complementary task: foreground layer decomposition with associated effects. However, although naïvely finetuning the inpainting model with LoRA applied to all blocks can produce high-quality alpha mattes, it fails to capture associated effects. Our systematic analysis reveals this arises because effect-related cues are primarily encoded in specific DiT blocks and become suppressed when LoRA is applied across all blocks. To address this, we introduce EasyOmnimatte, the first unified, end-to-end video omnimatte method. Concretely, we finetune a pretrained video inpainting diffusion model to learn dual complementary experts while keeping its original weights intact: an Effect Expert, where LoRA is applied only to effect-sensitive DiT blocks to capture the coarse structure of the foreground and associated effects, and a fully LoRA-finetuned Quality Expert learns to refine the alpha matte. During sampling, Effect Expert is used for denoising at early, high-noise steps, while Quality Expert takes over at later, low-noise steps. This design eliminates the need for two full diffusion passes, significantly reducing computational cost without compromising output quality. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of this Dual-Expert strategy. Experiments demonstrate that EasyOmnimatte sets a new state-of-the-art for video omnimatte and enables various downstream tasks, significantly outperforming baselines in both quality and efficiency.

TL;DR: DPAR是一种动态聚合图像token的decoder-only模型，通过可变patch大小减少计算需求，提升生成效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统固定长度token化方案在高分辨率图像生成中面临token数量二次增长问题，导致注意力机制的计算和内存需求显著增加。

Method: 利用轻量级自回归模型的next-token预测熵作为合并token的依据，通过信息内容动态生成非均匀patch，仅对生成高信息区域分配更多计算资源。

Result: 在ImageNet-256/384分辨率下token数量减少1.81x/2.06x，训练FLOPs降低40%，FID优化27.1%，且支持推理阶段扩展更大patch尺寸。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持架构兼容性的同时，通过信息驱动的动态token聚合显著提升生成效率，为自回归图像生成提供可行的优化路径。

Abstract: Decoder-only autoregressive image generation typically relies on fixed-length tokenization schemes whose token counts grow quadratically with resolution, substantially increasing the computational and memory demands of attention. We present DPAR, a novel decoder-only autoregressive model that dynamically aggregates image tokens into a variable number of patches for efficient image generation. Our work is the first to demonstrate that next-token prediction entropy from a lightweight and unsupervised autoregressive model provides a reliable criterion for merging tokens into larger patches based on information content. DPAR makes minimal modifications to the standard decoder architecture, ensuring compatibility with multimodal generation frameworks and allocating more compute to generation of high-information image regions. Further, we demonstrate that training with dynamically sized patches yields representations that are robust to patch boundaries, allowing DPAR to scale to larger patch sizes at inference. DPAR reduces token count by 1.81x and 2.06x on Imagenet 256 and 384 generation resolution respectively, leading to a reduction of up to 40% FLOPs in training costs. Further, our method exhibits faster convergence and improves FID by up to 27.1% relative to baseline models.

*Mo Wang,Junfeng Xia,Wenhao Ye,Enyu Liu,Kaining Peng,Jianfeng Feng,Quanying Liu,Hongkai Wen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SLIM-Brain is a sample-efficient, low-memory fMRI analysis method that reduces data dimensionality and computational costs by adaptively selecting salient brain regions while preserving spatial details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional fMRI analysis methods either lose spatial resolution (atlas-based) or require excessive resources (atlas-free). The work aims to create a general-purpose model that balances data efficiency and spatial fidelity with lower training costs.

Method: SLIM-Brain uses a two-stage approach: (1) a lightweight temporal extractor identifies salient data windows, and (2) a hierarchical encoder (Hiera-JEPA) learns voxel-level representations from only the top-k selected windows, removing ~70% masked patches to reduce memory usage.

Result: Sets new state-of-the-art performance across seven fMRI benchmarks with only ~4,000 pre-training sessions and 30% GPU memory usage compared to conventional atlas-free methods.

Conclusion: SLIM-Brain resolves dual efficiency bottlenecks in fMRI foundation models by adaptively focusing on critical brain regions, enabling effective large-scale analysis with reduced cohort sizes and computational resources.

Abstract: Foundation models are emerging as a powerful paradigm for fMRI analysis, but current approaches face a dual bottleneck of data- and training-efficiency. Atlas-based methods aggregate voxel signals into fixed regions of interest, reducing data dimensionality but discarding fine-grained spatial details, and requiring extremely large cohorts to train effectively as general-purpose foundation models. Atlas-free methods, on the other hand, operate directly on voxel-level information - preserving spatial fidelity but are prohibitively memory- and compute-intensive, making large-scale pre-training infeasible. We introduce SLIM-Brain (Sample-efficient, Low-memory fMRI Foundation Model for Human Brain), a new atlas-free foundation model that simultaneously improves both data- and training-efficiency. SLIM-Brain adopts a two-stage adaptive design: (i) a lightweight temporal extractor captures global context across full sequences and ranks data windows by saliency, and (ii) a 4D hierarchical encoder (Hiera-JEPA) learns fine-grained voxel-level representations only from the top-$k$ selected windows, while deleting about 70% masked patches. Extensive experiments across seven public benchmarks show that SLIM-Brain establishes new state-of-the-art performance on diverse tasks, while requiring only 4 thousand pre-training sessions and approximately 30% of GPU memory comparing to traditional voxel-level methods.

Abstract: Digital crown design remains a labor-intensive bottleneck in restorative dentistry. We present \textbf{CrownGen}, a generative framework that automates patient-customized crown design using a denoising diffusion model on a novel tooth-level point cloud representation. The system employs two core components: a boundary prediction module to establish spatial priors and a diffusion-based generative module to synthesize high-fidelity morphology for multiple teeth in a single inference pass. We validated CrownGen through a quantitative benchmark on 496 external scans and a clinical study of 26 restoration cases. Results demonstrate that CrownGen surpasses state-of-the-art models in geometric fidelity and significantly reduces active design time. Clinical assessments by trained dentists confirmed that CrownGen-assisted crowns are statistically non-inferior in quality to those produced by expert technicians using manual workflows. By automating complex prosthetic modeling, CrownGen offers a scalable solution to lower costs, shorten turnaround times, and enhance patient access to high-quality dental care.

Abstract: Recent progress in diffusion models has significantly advanced the field of human image animation. While existing methods can generate temporally consistent results for short or regular motions, significant challenges remain, particularly in generating long-duration videos. Furthermore, the synthesis of fine-grained facial and hand details remains under-explored, limiting the applicability of current approaches in real-world, high-quality applications. To address these limitations, we propose a diffusion transformer (DiT)-based framework which focuses on generating high-fidelity and long-duration human animation videos. First, we design a set of hybrid implicit guidance signals and a sharpness guidance factor, enabling our framework to additionally incorporate detailed facial and hand features as guidance. Next, we incorporate the time-aware position shift fusion module, modify the input format within the DiT backbone, and refer to this mechanism as the Position Shift Adaptive Module, which enables video generation of arbitrary length. Finally, we introduce a novel data augmentation strategy and a skeleton alignment model to reduce the impact of human shape variations across different identities. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, achieving superior performance in both high-fidelity and long-duration human image animation.

Abstract: Product posters blend striking visuals with informative text to highlight the product and capture customer attention. However, crafting appealing posters and manually optimizing them based on online performance is laborious and resource-consuming. To address this, we introduce AutoPP, an automated pipeline for product poster generation and optimization that eliminates the need for human intervention. Specifically, the generator, relying solely on basic product information, first uses a unified design module to integrate the three key elements of a poster (background, text, and layout) into a cohesive output. Then, an element rendering module encodes these elements into condition tokens, efficiently and controllably generating the product poster. Based on the generated poster, the optimizer enhances its Click-Through Rate (CTR) by leveraging online feedback. It systematically replaces elements to gather fine-grained CTR comparisons and utilizes Isolated Direct Preference Optimization (IDPO) to attribute CTR gains to isolated elements. Our work is supported by AutoPP1M, the largest dataset specifically designed for product poster generation and optimization, which contains one million high-quality posters and feedback collected from over one million users. Experiments demonstrate that AutoPP achieves state-of-the-art results in both offline and online settings. Our code and dataset are publicly available at: https://github.com/JD-GenX/AutoPP

Abstract: Detection of various lesions in brain MRI is clinically critical, but challenging due to the diversity of lesions and variability in imaging conditions. Current unsupervised learning methods detect anomalies mainly through reconstructing abnormal images into pseudo-healthy images (PHIs) by normal samples learning and then analyzing differences between images. However, these unsupervised models face two significant limitations: restricted generalizability to multi-modality and multi-center MRIs due to their reliance on the specific imaging information in normal training data, and constrained performance due to abnormal residuals propagated from input images to reconstructed PHIs. To address these limitations, two novel modules are proposed, forming a new PHI reconstruction framework. Firstly, the disentangled representation module is proposed to improve generalizability by decoupling brain MRI into imaging information and essential imaging-invariant anatomical images, ensuring that the reconstruction focuses on the anatomy. Specifically, brain anatomical priors and a differentiable one-hot encoding operator are introduced to constrain the disentanglement results and enhance the disentanglement stability. Secondly, the edge-to-image restoration module is designed to reconstruct high-quality PHIs by restoring the anatomical representation from the high-frequency edge information of anatomical images, and then recoupling the disentangled imaging information. This module not only suppresses abnormal residuals in PHI by reducing abnormal pixels input through edge-only input, but also effectively reconstructs normal regions using the preserved structural details in the edges. Evaluated on nine public datasets (4,443 patients' MRIs from multiple centers), our method outperforms 17 SOTA methods, achieving absolute improvements of +18.32% in AP and +13.64% in DSC.

### [54] [Data relativistic uncertainty framework for low-illumination anime scenery image enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21944)
*Yiquan Gao,John See*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文旨在解决动漫风景图像中的低光照质量退化问题，提出了一种结合不确定性信息的新框架（DRU），基于类比光的波粒二象性理论，动态调整目标函数以提升模型学习效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低光增强研究主要集中在自然图像和视频，而动漫风景领域缺乏数据和方法；同时现有方法未能有效利用数据中的不确定性信息。

Method: 构建多源异构的无配对动漫风景数据集，提出数据相对不确定性（DRU）框架，借鉴相对论GAN思想，通过光照不确定性的定量建模实现目标函数动态优化。

Result: 在EnlightenGANs模型上验证DRU框架有效性，获得超越SOTA方法的感知质量和美学效果，尤其在复杂光照条件下表现突出。

Conclusion: 开创了以数据为中心的光照增强学习范式，提出的方法具有跨视觉与语言领域的潜在推广价值。

Abstract: By contrast with the prevailing works of low-light enhancement in natural images and videos, this study copes with the low-illumination quality degradation in anime scenery images to bridge the domain gap. For such an underexplored enhancement task, we first curate images from various sources and construct an unpaired anime scenery dataset with diverse environments and illumination conditions to address the data scarcity. To exploit the power of uncertainty information inherent with the diverse illumination conditions, we propose a Data Relativistic Uncertainty (DRU) framework, motivated by the idea from Relativistic GAN. By analogy with the wave-particle duality of light, our framework interpretably defines and quantifies the illumination uncertainty of dark/bright samples, which is leveraged to dynamically adjust the objective functions to recalibrate the model learning under data uncertainty. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of DRU framework by training several versions of EnlightenGANs, yielding superior perceptual and aesthetic qualities beyond the state-of-the-art methods that are incapable of learning from data uncertainty perspective. We hope our framework can expose a novel paradigm of data-centric learning for potential visual and language domains. Code is available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种自动化生成植被分类紧凑光谱指数的方法，通过组合光谱波段并构造多项式特征，结合特征选择技术达到高精度且可解释的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统光谱指数可能忽略波段间的交互关系且难以适应复杂场景，需构建结构化搜索空间以保持光照不变性的同时提高分类性能。

Method: 从光谱波段计算所有成对归一化差分，通过二阶多项式展开生成候选特征，利用方差分析、递归消元和L1正则化SVM进行特征筛选，最终构建简单模型。

Result: 在加拿大萨斯喀彻温的Kochia检测中，单个二阶指数达96.26%准确率，八特征组合提升至97.70%，特征均来自红边波段（b4-b8）交互项，验证了跨平台部署可行性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过简单算术运算实现光照不变性光谱指数自动生成，具有跨传感器通用性，开源工具ndindex可加速实际应用。

Abstract: We introduce an automated way to find compact spectral indices for vegetation classification. The idea is to take all pairwise normalized differences from the spectral bands and then build polynomial combinations up to a fixed degree, which gives a structured search space that still keeps the illumination invariance needed in remote sensing. For a sensor with $n$ bands this produces $\binom{n}{2}$ base normalized differences, and the degree-2 polynomial expansion gives 1,080 candidate features for the 10-band Sentinel-2 configuration we use here. Feature selection methods (ANOVA filtering, recursive elimination, and $L_1$-regularized SVM) then pick out small sets of indices that reach the desired accuracy, so the final models stay simple and easy to interpret. We test the framework on Kochia (\textit{Bassia scoparia}) detection using Sentinel-2 imagery from Saskatchewan, Canada ($N = 2{,}318$ samples, 2022--2024). A single degree-2 index, the product of two normalized differences from the red-edge bands, already reaches 96.26\% accuracy, and using eight indices only raises this to 97.70\%. In every case the chosen features are degree-2 products built from bands $b_4$ through $b_8$, which suggests that the discriminative signal comes from spectral \emph{interactions} rather than individual band ratios. Because the indices involve only simple arithmetic, they can be deployed directly in platforms like Google Earth Engine. The same approach works for other sensors and classification tasks, and an open-source implementation (\texttt{ndindex}) is available.

Motivation: 高风险领域中小型视觉模型因计算资源低和可解释性受青睐，但现有解释表明其决策常违背人类知识，依赖虚假相关性，导致实际部署脆弱性。需通过人机协作提升模型可靠性。

Method: 建立LVLM-VA双向接口：一方面将模型行为转化为自然语言解释；另一方面将人类类级规则映射为图像级具体评论，实现领域专家与模型的高效交互式对齐。

Result: 在合成与真实数据集验证中，LVLM-VA显著提升模型行为与人类规范的一致性，同时减少对虚假特征和群体偏见的依赖，且不依赖人工标注的细粒度反馈。

Conclusion: LVLM-VA通过双向人机协作桥梁，成功解决小模型与人类知识的对齐问题，证明大模型通用化能力在提升专用模型可信度方面的关键作用，该方法对高风险领域模型部署具有重要价值。

Abstract: In high-stakes domains, small task-specific vision models are crucial due to their low computational requirements and the availability of numerous methods to explain their results. However, these explanations often reveal that the models do not align well with human domain knowledge, relying instead on spurious correlations. This might result in brittle behavior once deployed in the real-world. To address this issue, we introduce a novel and efficient method for aligning small task-specific vision models with human domain knowledge by leveraging the generalization capabilities of a Large Vision Language Model (LVLM). Our LVLM-Aided Visual Alignment (LVLM-VA) method provides a bidirectional interface that translates model behavior into natural language and maps human class-level specifications to image-level critiques, enabling effective interaction between domain experts and the model. Our method demonstrates substantial improvement in aligning model behavior with human specifications, as validated on both synthetic and real-world datasets. We show that it effectively reduces the model's dependence on spurious features and on group-specific biases, without requiring fine-grained feedback.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLMs因过度依赖语言先验知识和视觉特征整合不足导致生成虚假内容，且已有方法缺乏可训练性，无法充分优化。

Method: 构建包含真实响应（正样本）和虚假响应（负样本）的激活数据集；分析响应对的隐状态差异以定位易致幻参数簇；通过对抗性前缀优化，强制模型优先依据视觉证据更新参数。

Result: 在生成式和判别式VLM任务中均显著减轻幻觉现象，且代码已开源。

Conclusion: 通过对抗参数编辑策略，成功抑制VLMs依赖语言先验偏差，证明了可训练模块对对齐视觉与语言表征的重要性。

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have garnered increasing attention in the AI community due to their promising practical applications, they exhibit persistent hallucination issues, generating outputs misaligned with visual inputs. Recent studies attribute these hallucinations to VLMs' over-reliance on linguistic priors and insufficient visual feature integration, proposing heuristic decoding calibration strategies to mitigate them. However, the non-trainable nature of these strategies inherently limits their optimization potential. To this end, we propose an adversarial parametric editing framework for Hallucination mitigation in VLMs, which follows an \textbf{A}ctivate-\textbf{L}ocate-\textbf{E}dit \textbf{A}dversarially paradigm. Specifically, we first construct an activation dataset that comprises grounded responses (positive samples attentively anchored in visual features) and hallucinatory responses (negative samples reflecting LLM prior bias and internal knowledge artifacts). Next, we identify critical hallucination-prone parameter clusters by analyzing differential hidden states of response pairs. Then, these clusters are fine-tuned using prompts injected with adversarial tuned prefixes that are optimized to maximize visual neglect, thereby forcing the model to prioritize visual evidence over inherent parametric biases. Evaluations on both generative and discriminative VLM tasks demonstrate the significant effectiveness of ALEAHallu in alleviating hallucinations. Our code is available at https://github.com/hujiayu1223/ALEAHallu.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无人机VLN方法难以在复杂环境中建模长期时空上下文，导致语义对齐不准确和路径规划不稳定。

Method: 1) 基于槽的历史图像压缩模块将多视角历史观测压缩为紧凑表示；2) 时空轨迹编码捕捉时间动态和空间结构；3) 提示引导的多模态融合模块集成时空上下文与当前观测。

Result: 在成功率提升7.89%、路径长度加权成功率提升6.33%，且在已见和未见环境中均表现稳定。

Conclusion: LongFly通过结构化时空建模有效解决了无人机长视野导航中的语义与路径规划难题。

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are crucial tools for post-disaster search and rescue, facing challenges such as high information density, rapid changes in viewpoint, and dynamic structures, especially in long-horizon navigation. However, current UAV vision-and-language navigation(VLN) methods struggle to model long-horizon spatiotemporal context in complex environments, resulting in inaccurate semantic alignment and unstable path planning. To this end, we propose LongFly, a spatiotemporal context modeling framework for long-horizon UAV VLN. LongFly proposes a history-aware spatiotemporal modeling strategy that transforms fragmented and redundant historical data into structured, compact, and expressive representations. First, we propose the slot-based historical image compression module, which dynamically distills multi-view historical observations into fixed-length contextual representations. Then, the spatiotemporal trajectory encoding module is introduced to capture the temporal dynamics and spatial structure of UAV trajectories. Finally, to integrate existing spatiotemporal context with current observations, we design the prompt-guided multimodal integration module to support time-based reasoning and robust waypoint prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that LongFly outperforms state-of-the-art UAV VLN baselines by 7.89\% in success rate and 6.33\% in success weighted by path length, consistently across both seen and unseen environments.

Motivation: 传统深度伪造检测方法依赖手工特征且泛化能力差，作者旨在设计一个更高效且适应多种伪造模式的检测框架。

Method: 核心方法包括深度伪造表征学习、特征空间再分配策略，以及无需额外参数的特征增强技术，整体框架仅包含0.28M可训练参数。

Result: 实验表明该框架在跨域/跨操作场景下达到SOTA性能，同时保持极低参数量（仅需同类方法1%参数），验证了设计的有效性。

Conclusion: GenDF通过轻量化架构实现了深度伪造检测的性能突破，解决了现有方法在实际应用中的泛化性与部署成本难题。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence has enabled the creation of highly realistic fake facial images, posing serious threats to personal privacy and the integrity of online information. Existing deepfake detection methods often rely on handcrafted forensic cues and complex architectures, achieving strong performance in intra-domain settings but suffering significant degradation when confronted with unseen forgery patterns. In this paper, we propose GenDF, a simple yet effective framework that transfers a powerful large-scale vision model to the deepfake detection task with a compact and neat network design. GenDF incorporates deepfake-specific representation learning to capture discriminative patterns between real and fake facial images, feature space redistribution to mitigate distribution mismatch, and a classification-invariant feature augmentation strategy to enhance generalization without introducing additional trainable parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GenDF achieves state-of-the-art generalization performance in cross-domain and cross-manipulation settings while requiring only 0.28M trainable parameters, validating the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对提示驱动视频分割基础模型（VSFMs）的新型后门攻击框架BadVSFM，解决了传统攻击在该领域无效的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统后门攻击（如BadNet）在VSFMs上攻击成功率（ASR）低于5%，需探究其原因并设计针对性攻击方案。

Method: 提出两阶段策略：(1)引导图像编码器使触发帧映射到目标嵌入，(2)训练掩码解码器使触发帧-提示对生成共享目标掩码，同时保持干净样本性能。

Result: 在2个数据集和5种VSFMs上验证，ASR提升显著且保持干净分割质量，消融实验证实两阶段设计的必要性。

Conclusion: 揭示了当前VSFMs对后门攻击的脆弱性，现有防御方法难以有效防护，表明需加强该领域安全性研究。

Abstract: Prompt-driven Video Segmentation Foundation Models (VSFMs) such as SAM2 are increasingly deployed in applications like autonomous driving and digital pathology, raising concerns about backdoor threats. Surprisingly, we find that directly transferring classic backdoor attacks (e.g., BadNet) to VSFMs is almost ineffective, with ASR below 5\%. To understand this, we study encoder gradients and attention maps and observe that conventional training keeps gradients for clean and triggered samples largely aligned, while attention still focuses on the true object, preventing the encoder from learning a distinct trigger-related representation. To address this challenge, we propose BadVSFM, the first backdoor framework tailored to prompt-driven VSFMs. BadVSFM uses a two-stage strategy: (1) steer the image encoder so triggered frames map to a designated target embedding while clean frames remain aligned with a clean reference encoder; (2) train the mask decoder so that, across prompt types, triggered frame-prompt pairs produce a shared target mask, while clean outputs stay close to a reference decoder. Extensive experiments on two datasets and five VSFMs show that BadVSFM achieves strong, controllable backdoor effects under diverse triggers and prompts while preserving clean segmentation quality. Ablations over losses, stages, targets, trigger settings, and poisoning rates demonstrate robustness to reasonable hyperparameter changes and confirm the necessity of the two-stage design. Finally, gradient-conflict analysis and attention visualizations show that BadVSFM separates triggered and clean representations and shifts attention to trigger regions, while four representative defenses remain largely ineffective, revealing an underexplored vulnerability in current VSFMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAI-UI introduces foundation GUI agents (2B-235B parameters) with self-evolving data pipelines, device-cloud collaboration, and online RL to overcome deployment challenges in human-computer interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To revolutionize next-gen human-computer interaction by developing realistic GUI agents addressing critical deployment challenges: native user interaction, UI-operation limits, deployment architecture gaps, and environmental brittleness.

Method: Unified framework combining 1) self-evolving data pipeline integrating user interaction + MCP tool calls, 2) device-cloud collaboration system for task execution routing, 3) optimized online RL framework scaling parallel environments (32→512) and context length (15→50 steps).

Result: Established SOTA in GUI grounding (73.5% ScreenSpot-Pro) and mobile navigation (76.7% AndroidWorld). Device-cloud system improved on-device performance by 33%, reduced cloud usage 40%, enabled 49.2% UI-Vision score, and showed 5.2pt RL gain from environment scaling.

Conclusion: MAI-UI effectively addresses GUI agent deployment challenges through architectural innovation and scalable RL, achieving 41.7% MobileWorld success rate while maintaining user privacy and reducing computational costs.

Abstract: The development of GUI agents could revolutionize the next generation of human-computer interaction. Motivated by this vision, we present MAI-UI, a family of foundation GUI agents spanning the full spectrum of sizes, including 2B, 8B, 32B, and 235B-A22B variants. We identify four key challenges to realistic deployment: the lack of native agent-user interaction, the limits of UI-only operation, the absence of a practical deployment architecture, and brittleness in dynamic environments. MAI-UI addresses these issues with a unified methodology: a self-evolving data pipeline that expands the navigation data to include user interaction and MCP tool calls, a native device-cloud collaboration system routes execution by task state, and an online RL framework with advanced optimizations to scale parallel environments and context length. MAI-UI establishes new state-of-the-art across GUI grounding and mobile navigation. On grounding benchmarks, it reaches 73.5% on ScreenSpot-Pro, 91.3% on MMBench GUI L2, 70.9% on OSWorld-G, and 49.2% on UI-Vision, surpassing Gemini-3-Pro and Seed1.8 on ScreenSpot-Pro. On mobile GUI navigation, it sets a new SOTA of 76.7% on AndroidWorld, surpassing UI-Tars-2, Gemini-2.5-Pro and Seed1.8. On MobileWorld, MAI-UI obtains 41.7% success rate, significantly outperforming end-to-end GUI models and competitive with Gemini-3-Pro based agentic frameworks. Our online RL experiments show significant gains from scaling parallel environments from 32 to 512 (+5.2 points) and increasing environment step budget from 15 to 50 (+4.3 points). Finally, the native device-cloud collaboration system improves on-device performance by 33%, reduces cloud model calls by over 40%, and preserves user privacy.

TL;DR: This paper presents a real-time, interactive human avatar framework using autoregressive distillation and adversarial refinement, enabling natural gestures and body motions with state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous diffusion-based avatar methods are non-causal and computationally intensive for streaming, while interactive approaches are limited to head/shoulder regions. The authors aim to achieve real-time, full-body avatar generation with stable long-term consistency.

Method: A two-stage framework: (1) Autoregressive distillation to compress a high-fidelity video diffusion model, (2) Adversarial refinement with a Consistency-Aware Discriminator. Key innovations include Reference Sink (memory management), Reference-Anchored Positional Re-encoding (RAPR) for motion stability, and adversarial training for temporal coherence.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with 25x speedup over diffusion baselines, 58.7% improvement in gesture naturalness, and 39.2% higher temporal consistency vs. prior interactive methods. The model generates coherent full-body avatars reacting to real-time audio/video inputs.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates the first one-shot solution for real-time avatars with high-fidelity talking/listening behaviors and gestures. Components like RAPR and Reference Sink enable practical deployment of interactive digital humans in streaming scenarios.

Abstract: Real-time, streaming interactive avatars represent a critical yet challenging goal in digital human research. Although diffusion-based human avatar generation methods achieve remarkable success, their non-causal architecture and high computational costs make them unsuitable for streaming. Moreover, existing interactive approaches are typically limited to head-and-shoulder region, limiting their ability to produce gestures and body motions. To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage autoregressive adaptation and acceleration framework that applies autoregressive distillation and adversarial refinement to adapt a high-fidelity human video diffusion model for real-time, interactive streaming. To ensure long-term stability and consistency, we introduce three key components: a Reference Sink, a Reference-Anchored Positional Re-encoding (RAPR) strategy, and a Consistency-Aware Discriminator. Building on this framework, we develop a one-shot, interactive, human avatar model capable of generating both natural talking and listening behaviors with coherent gestures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing approaches in generation quality, real-time efficiency, and interaction naturalness.

Abstract: Recent approaches have demonstrated the promise of using diffusion models to generate interactive and explorable worlds. However, most of these methods face critical challenges such as excessively large parameter sizes, reliance on lengthy inference steps, and rapidly growing historical context, which severely limit real-time performance and lack text-controlled generation capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose \method, a novel framework designed to generate realistic, interactive, and continuous worlds from a single image or text prompt. \method achieves this through a carefully designed framework that supports keyboard-based exploration of the generated worlds. The framework comprises three core components: (1) a long-video generation framework integrating unified context compression with linear attention; (2) a real-time streaming acceleration strategy powered by bidirectional attention distillation and an enhanced text embedding scheme; (3) a text-controlled method for generating world events. We have provided the codebase in the supplementary material.

Conclusion: TDLP通过链路预测实现高效精准追踪，验证了其相较传统方法的优势，并为跟踪任务提供了可扩展的特征融合框架。

Abstract: Multi-object tracking aims to maintain object identities over time by associating detections across video frames. Two dominant paradigms exist in literature: tracking-by-detection methods, which are computationally efficient but rely on handcrafted association heuristics, and end-to-end approaches, which learn association from data at the cost of higher computational complexity. We propose Track-Detection Link Prediction (TDLP), a tracking-by-detection method that performs per-frame association via link prediction between tracks and detections, i.e., by predicting the correct continuation of each track at every frame. TDLP is architecturally designed primarily for geometric features such as bounding boxes, while optionally incorporating additional cues, including pose and appearance. Unlike heuristic-based methods, TDLP learns association directly from data without handcrafted rules, while remaining modular and computationally efficient compared to end-to-end trackers. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that TDLP consistently surpasses state-of-the-art performance across both tracking-by-detection and end-to-end methods. Finally, we provide a detailed analysis comparing link prediction with metric learning-based association and show that link prediction is more effective, particularly when handling heterogeneous features such as detection bounding boxes.

Conclusion: 提出的注意力机制混合与潜在空间扰动策略有效解决源信息依赖问题，为基于扩散模型的视觉编辑提供了新的解决方案，其模块化设计显著提升现有方法的编辑灵活性。

Abstract: Inversion-based visual editing provides an effective and training-free way to edit an image or a video based on user instructions. Existing methods typically inject source image information during the sampling process to maintain editing consistency. However, this sampling strategy overly relies on source information, which negatively affects the edits in the target image (e.g., failing to change the subject's atributes like pose, number, or color as instructed). In this work, we propose ProEdit to address this issue both in the attention and the latent aspects. In the attention aspect, we introduce KV-mix, which mixes KV features of the source and the target in the edited region, mitigating the influence of the source image on the editing region while maintaining background consistency. In the latent aspect, we propose Latents-Shift, which perturbs the edited region of the source latent, eliminating the influence of the inverted latent on the sampling. Extensive experiments on several image and video editing benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves SOTA performance. In addition, our design is plug-and-play, which can be seamlessly integrated into existing inversion and editing methods, such as RF-Solver, FireFlow and UniEdit.

Result: 在8个基准测试中，BiPS使Qwen2.5-VL-7B平均性能提升8.2%，并显著提升跨域泛化能力。

Conclusion: BiPS有效降低模型对文本捷径的依赖，同时提升对细粒度视觉证据的利用，从而改善模型整体表现。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) often benefit from intermediate visual cues, either injected via external tools or generated as latent visual tokens during reasoning, but these mechanisms still overlook fine-grained visual evidence (e.g., polylines in charts), generalize poorly across domains, and incur high inference-time cost. In this paper, we propose Bi-directional Perceptual Shaping (BiPS), which transforms question-conditioned masked views into bidirectional where-to-look signals that shape perception during training. BiPS first applies a KL-consistency constraint between the original image and an evidence-preserving view that keeps only question-relevant regions, encouraging coarse but complete coverage of supporting pixels. It then applies a KL-separation constraint between the original and an evidence-ablated view where critical pixels are masked so the image no longer supports the original answer, discouraging text-only shortcuts (i.e., answering from text alone) and enforcing fine-grained visual reliance. Across eight benchmarks, BiPS boosts Qwen2.5-VL-7B by 8.2% on average and shows strong out-of-domain generalization to unseen datasets and image types.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了现有方法为何未能有效减少用户对大型语言模型（LLMs）的过度依赖，发现失败模式存在且可被教学，但需改进自动化发现方法及评估指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在复杂任务表现优异，但用户常因高估其能力而误用。尽管已有研究尝试识别LLM的易错模式以教育用户，但效果不佳。该论文试图分析原因并提出改进方案。

Method: 首先验证LLM是否存在可被描述的失败模式（通过元标签分组测试）；其次测试提示工程和嵌入方法能否有效识别这些模式；最后提出新的用户教学效果评估指标，并通过用户研究验证其有效性。

Result: 确认了LLM存在可被教学的失败模式（如特定任务难度或数据特征），但现有自动化方法效果不一；新提出的评估指标显示教学能提升用户预判能力，而传统的人机协作准确率指标未体现此效果。

Conclusion: 向 users 教学 LLM 的失败模式具有潜力，但需优化自动化模式发现技术，并采用更贴合实际应用的教学评估指标。

Abstract: People use large language models (LLMs) when they should not. This is partly because they see LLMs compose poems and answer intricate questions, so they understandably, but incorrectly, assume LLMs won't stumble on basic tasks like simple arithmetic. Prior work has tried to address this by clustering instance embeddings into regions where an LLM is likely to fail and automatically describing patterns in these regions. The found failure patterns are taught to users to mitigate their overreliance. Yet, this approach has not fully succeeded. In this analysis paper, we aim to understand why.
  We first examine whether the negative result stems from the absence of failure patterns. We group instances in two datasets by their meta-labels and evaluate an LLM's predictions on these groups. We then define criteria to flag groups that are sizable and where the LLM is error-prone, and find meta-label groups that meet these criteria. Their meta-labels are the LLM's failure patterns that could be taught to users, so they do exist. We next test whether prompting and embedding-based approaches can surface these known failures. Without this, users cannot be taught about them to reduce their overreliance. We find mixed results across methods, which could explain the negative result. Finally, we revisit the final metric that measures teaching effectiveness. We propose to assess a user's ability to effectively use the given failure patterns to anticipate when an LLM is error-prone. A user study shows a positive effect from teaching with this metric, unlike the human-AI team accuracy. Our findings show that teaching failure patterns could be a viable approach to mitigating overreliance, but success depends on better automated failure-discovery methods and using metrics like ours.

TL;DR: COMETH框架结合上下文学习、LLM语义抽象和人类道德评估，提升对模糊道德行为可接受性的预测准确性，并提供可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有道德评估模型未能有效整合人类判断的上下文敏感性，导致预测准确率较低（约30%），且缺乏可解释性。

Method: 预处理：用LLM过滤和MiniLM+K-means聚类构建标准化动作数据集；核心流程：通过在线聚类人类判断分布学习动作特定道德上下文；泛化模块：提取二值上下文特征并权重学习透明模型。

Result: 在300个场景中，COMETH的平均人类判断一致性达60%（较纯LLM提升100%），开源了标注数据集并揭示决策驱动特征。

Conclusion: COMETH证明了结合上下文学习和人类反馈能更有效建模道德判断，提供了比端到端LLM更透明、可解释的替代方案。

Abstract: Moral actions are judged not only by their outcomes but by the context in which they occur. We present COMETH (Contextual Organization of Moral Evaluation from Textual Human inputs), a framework that integrates a probabilistic context learner with LLM-based semantic abstraction and human moral evaluations to model how context shapes the acceptability of ambiguous actions. We curate an empirically grounded dataset of 300 scenarios across six core actions (violating Do not kill, Do not deceive, and Do not break the law) and collect ternary judgments (Blame/Neutral/Support) from N=101 participants. A preprocessing pipeline standardizes actions via an LLM filter and MiniLM embeddings with K-means, producing robust, reproducible core-action clusters. COMETH then learns action-specific moral contexts by clustering scenarios online from human judgment distributions using principled divergence criteria. To generalize and explain predictions, a Generalization module extracts concise, non-evaluative binary contextual features and learns feature weights in a transparent likelihood-based model. Empirically, COMETH roughly doubles alignment with majority human judgments relative to end-to-end LLM prompting (approx. 60% vs. approx. 30% on average), while revealing which contextual features drive its predictions. The contributions are: (i) an empirically grounded moral-context dataset, (ii) a reproducible pipeline combining human judgments with model-based context learning and LLM semantics, and (iii) an interpretable alternative to end-to-end LLMs for context-sensitive moral prediction and explanation.

Conclusion: 建立了首个系统性的幽默理解评估框架，证实大模型已具备接近人类的幽默理解能力，提出的多维度分析方法可推动类人创造力研究

Abstract: Humor is a salient testbed for human-like creative thinking in large language models (LLMs). We study humor using the Japanese creative response game Oogiri, in which participants produce witty responses to a given prompt, and ask the following research question: What makes such responses funny to humans? Previous work has offered only limited reliable means to answer this question. Existing datasets contain few candidate responses per prompt, expose popularity signals during ratings, and lack objective and comparable metrics for funniness. Thus, we introduce Oogiri-Master and Oogiri-Corpus, which are a benchmark and dataset designed to enable rigorous evaluation of humor understanding in LLMs. Each prompt is paired with approximately 100 diverse candidate responses, and funniness is rated independently by approximately 100 human judges without access to others' ratings, reducing popularity bias and enabling robust aggregation. Using Oogiri-Corpus, we conduct a quantitative analysis of the linguistic factors associated with funniness, such as text length, ambiguity, and incongruity resolution, and derive objective metrics for predicting human judgments. Subsequently, we benchmark a range of LLMs and human baselines in Oogiri-Master, demonstrating that state-of-the-art models approach human performance and that insight-augmented prompting improves the model performance. Our results provide a principled basis for evaluating and advancing humor understanding in LLMs.

Conclusion: 将内存管理转化为序贯决策问题的方法优于传统启发式策略，为开发长期交互优化的LLM记忆系统提供了理论框架。

Abstract: External memory is a key component of modern large language model (LLM) systems, enabling long-term interaction and personalization. Despite its importance, memory management is still largely driven by hand-designed heuristics, offering little insight into the long-term and uncertain consequences of memory decisions. In practice, choices about what to read or write shape future retrieval and downstream behavior in ways that are difficult to anticipate. We argue that memory management should be viewed as a sequential decision-making problem under uncertainty, where the utility of memory is delayed and dependent on future interactions. To this end, we propose DAM (Decision-theoretic Agent Memory), a decision-theoretic framework that decomposes memory management into immediate information access and hierarchical storage maintenance. Within this architecture, candidate operations are evaluated via value functions and uncertainty estimators, enabling an aggregate policy to arbitrate decisions based on estimated long-term utility and risk. Our contribution is not a new algorithm, but a principled reframing that clarifies the limitations of heuristic approaches and provides a foundation for future research on uncertainty-aware memory systems.

### [71] [A Unified Definition of Hallucination, Or: It's the World Model, Stupid](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21577)
*Emmy Liu,Varun Gangal,Chelsea Zou,Xiaoqi Huang,Michael Yu,Alex Chang,Zhuofu Tao,Sachin Kumar,Steven Y. Feng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unified definition of hallucination as 'inaccurate internal world modeling' in large language models (LLMs), integrating historical definitions and emphasizing the need for explicit 'world models' and 'knowledge conflict policies'. It introduces synthetic benchmarks to test and improve LLM world modeling capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite persistent efforts, hallucinations in LLMs remain unresolved. The authors aim to address the lack of progress by re-examining historical definitions of hallucination, which often focus on different aspects but lack a cohesive framework to unify them.

Method: Analyzed definitions of hallucination from the literature through a historical lens, synthesized them into a unified definition, and proposed a framework linking hallucination to world modeling errors. Introduced synthetic benchmarks with fully specified world models to systematically test and enhance LLM world modeling.

Result: The proposed definition unifies existing perspectives on hallucination under the framework of inaccurate internal world modeling that is observable (e.g., factual contradictions with knowledge bases). Demonstrated how varying reference world models and knowledge conflict policies explains divergent definitions in the literature.

Conclusion: This unified view clarifies evaluation criteria for hallucinations, distinguishes them from other errors (e.g., planning mistakes), and provides a structured approach for benchmarking and mitigating hallucinations via synthetic world models. The authors suggest this framework will improve LLM evaluation and development.

Abstract: Despite numerous attempts to solve the issue of hallucination since the inception of neural language models, it remains a problem in even frontier large language models today. Why is this the case? We walk through definitions of hallucination used in the literature from a historical perspective up to the current day, and fold them into a single definition of hallucination, wherein different prior definitions focus on different aspects of our definition. At its core, we argue that hallucination is simply inaccurate (internal) world modeling, in a form where it is observable to the user (e.g., stating a fact which contradicts a knowledge base, or producing a summary which contradicts a known source). By varying the reference world model as well as the knowledge conflict policy (e.g., knowledge base vs. in-context), we arrive at the different existing definitions of hallucination present in the literature.
  We argue that this unified view is useful because it forces evaluations to make clear their assumed "world" or source of truth, clarifies what should and should not be called hallucination (as opposed to planning or reward/incentive-related errors), and provides a common language to compare benchmarks and mitigation techniques. Building on this definition, we outline plans for a family of benchmarks in which hallucinations are defined as mismatches with synthetic but fully specified world models in different environments, and sketch out how these benchmarks can use such settings to stress-test and improve the world modeling components of language models.

TL;DR: Gamayun is a 1.5B-parameter multilingual model trained on 2.5T tokens with a novel two-stage strategy, outperforming larger models in efficiency and multilingual benchmarks, especially in Russian.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of research on small, non-English-centric LLMs for resource-constrained environments by improving cross-lingual alignment and performance transfer.

Method: Proposed a two-stage pre-training strategy: (1) balanced multilingual training for cross-lingual alignment, (2) high-quality English enrichment to boost multilingual performance transfer.

Result: Outperformed LLaMA3.2-1B (9T tokens) and Qwen2.5-1.5B (18T tokens) on multilingual/English benchmarks, achieved state-of-the-art Russian results (e.g., MERA), and matched Qwen3 (36T tokens) on non-STEM tasks.

Conclusion: Gamayun demonstrates that carefully designed pre-training strategies can enable small-scale multilingual LLMs to rival larger models, offering practical solutions for resource-limited deployments.

Abstract: We present Gamayun, a 1.5B-parameter multilingual language model trained entirely from scratch on 2.5T tokens. Designed for efficiency and deployment in resource-constrained environments, Gamayun addresses the lack of research on small non-English-centric LLMs by adopting a novel two-stage pre-training strategy: balanced multilingual training for cross-lingual alignment, followed by high-quality English enrichment to transfer performance gains across languages. Our model supports 12 languages, with special focus on Russian. Despite a significantly smaller training budget than comparable models, Gamayun outperforms LLaMA3.2-1B (9T tokens) on all considered benchmarks, and surpasses Qwen2.5-1.5B (18T tokens) on a wide range of English and multilingual tasks. It matches or exceeds Qwen3 (36T tokens) on most tasks outside advanced STEM, achieving state-of-the-art results in Russian, including the MERA benchmark, among the models of comparable size (1-2B parameters).

Abstract: Hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) are commonly regarded as errors to be minimized. However, recent perspectives suggest that some hallucinations may encode creative or epistemically valuable content, a dimension that remains underquantified in current literature. Existing hallucination detection methods primarily focus on factual consistency, struggling to handle heterogeneous scientific tasks and balance creativity with accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose HIC-Bench, a novel evaluation framework that categorizes hallucinations into Intelligent Hallucinations (IH) and Defective Hallucinations (DH), enabling systematic investigation of their interplay in LLM creativity. HIC-Bench features three core characteristics: (1) Structured IH/DH Assessment. using a multi-dimensional metric matrix integrating Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking (TTCT) metrics (Originality, Feasibility, Value) with hallucination-specific dimensions (scientific plausibility, factual deviation); (2) Cross-Domain Applicability. spanning ten scientific domains with open-ended innovation tasks; and (3) Dynamic Prompt Optimization. leveraging the Dynamic Hallucination Prompt (DHP) to guide models toward creative and reliable outputs. The evaluation process employs multiple LLM judges, averaging scores to mitigate bias, with human annotators verifying IH/DH classifications. Experimental results reveal a nonlinear relationship between IH and DH, demonstrating that creativity and correctness can be jointly optimized. These insights position IH as a catalyst for creativity and reveal the ability of LLM hallucinations to drive scientific innovation.Additionally, the HIC-Bench offers a valuable platform for advancing research into the creative intelligence of LLM hallucinations.

Abstract: Human conversation is organized by an implicit chain of thoughts that manifests as timed speech acts. Capturing this causal pathway is key to building natural full-duplex interactive systems. We introduce a framework that enables reasoning over conversational behaviors by modeling this process as causal inference within a Graph-of-Thoughts (GoT). Our approach formalizes the intent-to-action pathway with a hierarchical labeling scheme, predicting high-level communicative intents and low-level speech acts to learn their causal and temporal dependencies. To train this system, we develop a hybrid corpus that pairs controllable, event-rich simulations with human-annotated rationales and real conversational speech. The GoT framework structures streaming predictions as an evolving graph, enabling a multimodal transformer to forecast the next speech act, generate concise justifications for its decisions, and dynamically refine its reasoning. Experiments on both synthetic and real duplex dialogues show that the framework delivers robust behavior detection, produces interpretable reasoning chains, and establishes a foundation for benchmarking conversational reasoning in full duplex spoken dialogue systems.

Abstract: Despite recent advancements of fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) to facilitate agent tasks, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methodologies for agent remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce three key strategies for PEFT in agent tasks: 1) Inspired by the increasingly dominant Reason+Action paradigm, we first decompose the capabilities necessary for the agent tasks into three distinct roles: reasoner, executor, and summarizer. The reasoner is responsible for comprehending the user's query and determining the next role based on the execution trajectory. The executor is tasked with identifying the appropriate functions and parameters to invoke. The summarizer conveys the distilled information from conversations back to the user. 2) We then propose the Mixture-of-Roles (MoR) framework, which comprises three specialized Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) groups, each designated to fulfill a distinct role. By focusing on their respective specialized capabilities and engaging in collaborative interactions, these LoRAs collectively accomplish the agent task. 3) To effectively fine-tune the framework, we develop a multi-role data generation pipeline based on publicly available datasets, incorporating role-specific content completion and reliability verification. We conduct extensive experiments and thorough ablation studies on various LLMs and agent benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method. This project is publicly available at https://mor-agent.github.io.

Motivation: 由于大型语言模型可能被滥用于虚假内容生成，且孟加拉语因其词汇丰富性和结构复杂性，现有AI生成文本检测方法在该语言的研究仍属空白，需要探索其检测有效性。

Method: 以XLMRoBERTa、mDeBERTa、BanglaBERT等五种模型为基础，分别进行零样本检测评估和任务专用微调实验，并通过准确率和F1分数对比模型性能。

Result: 零样本检测平均准确率约50%（接近随机），微调后XLM-RoBERTa等三模型指标提升至91%；而IndicBERT微调效果较弱，显示模型间性能差异。

Conclusion: 为孟加拉语AI生成内容检测提供了基准性能，证明任务专用微调的必要性，并表明特定多语言预训练模型在该任务中更具优势，为构建对抗AI生成内容的系统奠定基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can produce text that closely resembles human writing. This capability raises concerns about misuse, including disinformation and content manipulation. Detecting AI-generated text is essential to maintain authenticity and prevent malicious applications. Existing research has addressed detection in multiple languages, but the Bengali language remains largely unexplored. Bengali's rich vocabulary and complex structure make distinguishing human-written and AI-generated text particularly challenging. This study investigates five transformer-based models: XLMRoBERTa-Large, mDeBERTaV3-Base, BanglaBERT-Base, IndicBERT-Base and MultilingualBERT-Base. Zero-shot evaluation shows that all models perform near chance levels (around 50% accuracy) and highlight the need for task-specific fine-tuning. Fine-tuning significantly improves performance, with XLM-RoBERTa, mDeBERTa and MultilingualBERT achieving around 91% on both accuracy and F1-score. IndicBERT demonstrates comparatively weaker performance, indicating limited effectiveness in fine-tuning for this task. This work advances AI-generated text detection in Bengali and establishes a foundation for building robust systems to counter AI-generated content.

TL;DR: 该研究揭示了大型语言模型中的'潜在标记'（如COCONUT）无法真正实现逻辑推理，而是通过'伪推理'掩盖模型对捷径的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管潜在标记被宣传为增强推理能力的技术，但其黑盒特性阻碍了对模型行为的可靠性评估，这促使研究者从抗干扰性和推理保真度层面对其进行剖析。

Method: 通过两种互补路径分析：1) 干预实验通过扰动COCONUT/CoT标记测试模型敏感度；2) 捷径实验在偏向数据集和分布式外场景中评估模型表现。

Result: 1) COCONUT标记对扰动不敏感且缺乏推理关键信息；2) 在MMLU/HotpotQA任务中，COCONUT通过数据集漏洞而非真实推理提升基准分数。

Conclusion: COCONUT的本质是制造看似合理但掩盖捷径依赖的'伪推理路径'，其宣称的稳定性优势实为推理能力薄弱的表征。

Abstract: Latent tokens are gaining attention for enhancing reasoning in large language models (LLMs), yet their internal mechanisms remain unclear. This paper examines the problem from a reliability perspective, uncovering fundamental weaknesses: latent tokens function as uninterpretable placeholders rather than encoding faithful reasoning. While resistant to perturbation, they promote shortcut usage over genuine reasoning. We focus on Chain-of-Continuous-Thought (COCONUT), which claims better efficiency and stability than explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) while maintaining performance. We investigate this through two complementary approaches. First, steering experiments perturb specific token subsets, namely COCONUT and explicit CoT. Unlike CoT tokens, COCONUT tokens show minimal sensitivity to steering and lack reasoning-critical information. Second, shortcut experiments evaluate models under biased and out-of-distribution settings. Results on MMLU and HotpotQA demonstrate that COCONUT consistently exploits dataset artifacts, inflating benchmark performance without true reasoning. These findings reposition COCONUT as a pseudo-reasoning mechanism: it generates plausible traces that conceal shortcut dependence rather than faithfully representing reasoning processes.

Motivation: 现有主题检测方法难以处理稀疏短文本并实现跨对话一致性及用户偏好对齐，而现有方案在个性化主题建模和噪声抑制方面存在不足。

Method: 构建包含三部分的CATCH框架：1）上下文感知主题表示（融合话题上下文增强语义表征）；2）偏好引导聚类（结合语义相似度和用户交互反馈）；3）分层主题生成（多阶段降噪生成连贯标签）。

Result: 在DSTC-12多领域对话基准上，基于8B参数模型实现主题聚类性能提升，并生成高鲁棒性与连贯性的主题标签。

Conclusion: 研究表明，CATCH有效解决了短文本语义表征薄弱和跨对话主题一致性问题，在个性化主题检测与结构化生成方面具有显著优势。

Abstract: Theme detection is a fundamental task in user-centric dialogue systems, aiming to identify the latent topic of each utterance without relying on predefined schemas. Unlike intent induction, which operates within fixed label spaces, theme detection requires cross-dialogue consistency and alignment with personalized user preferences, posing significant challenges. Existing methods often struggle with sparse, short utterances for accurate topic representation and fail to capture user-level thematic preferences across dialogues. To address these challenges, we propose CATCH (Controllable Theme Detection with Contextualized Clustering and Hierarchical Generation), a unified framework that integrates three core components: (1) context-aware topic representation, which enriches utterance-level semantics using surrounding topic segments; (2) preference-guided topic clustering, which jointly models semantic proximity and personalized feedback to align themes across dialogue; and (3) a hierarchical theme generation mechanism designed to suppress noise and produce robust, coherent topic labels. Experiments on a multi-domain customer dialogue benchmark (DSTC-12) demonstrate the effectiveness of CATCH with 8B LLM in both theme clustering and topic generation quality.

Result: 框架显示不同MT系统在方言术语和语义连贯性方面存在显著差异，证明当前模型仍难以准确处理阿拉伯方言的特有语言特征。

Conclusion: Ara-HOPE为方言阿拉伯语机器翻译提供了标准化评估方案，并为改进方言感知型翻译系统提供了可操作的优化方向。

Abstract: Dialectal Arabic to Modern Standard Arabic (DA-MSA) translation is a challenging task in Machine Translation (MT) due to significant lexical, syntactic, and semantic divergences between Arabic dialects and MSA. Existing automatic evaluation metrics and general-purpose human evaluation frameworks struggle to capture dialect-specific MT errors, hindering progress in translation assessment. This paper introduces Ara-HOPE, a human-centric post-editing evaluation framework designed to systematically address these challenges. The framework includes a five-category error taxonomy and a decision-tree annotation protocol. Through comparative evaluation of three MT systems (Arabic-centric Jais, general-purpose GPT-3.5, and baseline NLLB-200), Ara-HOPE effectively highlights systematic performance differences between these systems. The results show that dialect-specific terminology and semantic preservation remain the most persistent challenges in DA-MSA translation. Ara-HOPE establishes a new framework for evaluating Dialectal Arabic MT quality and provides actionable guidance for improving dialect-aware MT systems.

*Ting-Hao K. Huang,Ryan A. Rossi,Sungchul Kim,Tong Yu,Ting-Yao E. Hsu,Ho Yin,Ng,C. Lee Giles*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The SciCap project evolved from a Penn State seed-funded initiative (2021-2025) into a leading effort in scientific figure-captioning, involving collaborations with Adobe, the Sloan Foundation, the curation of arXiv figure-caption datasets, annual challenges, and the development of tools to improve caption quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether domain-specific training (successful in text models like SciBERT) could enhance figure captioning, supported by institutional and foundation grants, and to address gaps in automated scientific figure description.

Method: Curated and updated a large dataset of arXiv figure-caption pairs, conducted automatic/human evaluations, adapted to advances in large language models, launched annual captioning challenges, and built interactive systems for caption improvement.

Result: Established a foundational dataset for scientific figure captioning, influenced research via annual challenges, developed evaluation benchmarks, and created interactive tools adopted by scientists, while highlighting persistent technical challenges.

Conclusion: SciCap's five-year journey demonstrated the viability of domain-specific training in captioning but identified unresolved issues like contextual coherence and long-term usability, directing future research toward scalable solutions and interdisciplinary collaboration.

Abstract: Between 2021 and 2025, the SciCap project grew from a small seed-funded idea at The Pennsylvania State University (Penn State) into one of the central efforts shaping the scientific figure-captioning landscape. Supported by a Penn State seed grant, Adobe, and the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, what began as our attempt to test whether domain-specific training, which was successful in text models like SciBERT, could also work for figure captions expanded into a multi-institution collaboration. Over these five years, we curated, released, and continually updated a large collection of figure-caption pairs from arXiv papers, conducted extensive automatic and human evaluations on both generated and author-written captions, navigated the rapid rise of large language models (LLMs), launched annual challenges, and built interactive systems that help scientists write better captions. In this piece, we look back at the first five years of SciCap and summarize the key technical and methodological lessons we learned. We then outline five major unsolved challenges and propose directions for the next phase of research in scientific figure captioning.

*Vitthal Bhandari*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过分析2025年发表的20篇文化偏见相关论文，提出当前自然语言处理领域对跨文化偏见的评估缺乏实际使用者参与，并生成一套观察框架以帮助未来研究更有效地处理文化偏见问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究发现LLMs存在跨文化泛化问题，但评估文化偏见时未有效结合实际使用者的社会情境，导致根本问题未被解决。研究旨在提出可操作的评估框架以弥补这一不足。

Method: 选取2025年发表的20篇文化偏见相关论文进行系统性分析，从中提取观察点并构建概念化偏差评估框架。

Result: 发现当前文化偏见研究普遍存在脱离实际应用场景的问题，并提出包含具体维度的观察框架，强调利益相关者参与的重要性。

Conclusion: 研究主张需建立更严格的社会影响评估机制，并通过系统性观察框架指导未来跨文化偏见研究，确保语言技术符合社会实际需求。

Abstract: Research has shown that while large language models (LLMs) can generate their responses based on cultural context, they are not perfect and tend to generalize across cultures. However, when evaluating the cultural bias of a language technology on any dataset, researchers may choose not to engage with stakeholders actually using that technology in real life, which evades the very fundamental problem they set out to address.
  Inspired by the work done by arXiv:2005.14050v2, I set out to analyse recent literature about identifying and evaluating cultural bias in Natural Language Processing (NLP). I picked out 20 papers published in 2025 about cultural bias and came up with a set of observations to allow NLP researchers in the future to conceptualize bias concretely and evaluate its harms effectively. My aim is to advocate for a robust assessment of the societal impact of language technologies exhibiting cross-cultural bias.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了DeMe框架，通过动态装饰策略优化大型语言模型的生成方法，使物联网系统在动态环境中更有效地完成任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有物联网任务生成方法难以应对未知环境，依赖固定逻辑而缺乏适应性，无法有效处理环境变化和异常情况。

Method: 基于LLM生成路径的动态装饰策略，结合隐藏目标分析、经验学习、环境反馈三种装饰机制（预装饰/后装饰/步骤插入），利用通用行为原则而非硬编码逻辑调整方法结构。

Result: 实验表明DeMe框架在面对未知或故障环境时，生成的任务方法表现出更强的适应性和安全性，比传统方法更有效。

Conclusion: 通过动态装饰策略显著提升物联网系统的环境自适应能力，为动态场景下的智能决策提供了新范式。

Abstract: Intelligent IoT systems increasingly rely on large language models (LLMs) to generate task-execution methods for dynamic environments. However, existing approaches lack the ability to systematically produce new methods when facing previously unseen situations, and they often depend on fixed, device-specific logic that cannot adapt to changing environmental conditions.In this paper, we propose Method Decoration (DeMe), a general framework that modifies the method-generation path of an LLM using explicit decorations derived from hidden goals, accumulated learned methods, and environmental feedback. Unlike traditional rule augmentation, decorations in DeMe are not hardcoded; instead, they are extracted from universal behavioral principles, experience, and observed environmental differences. DeMe enables the agent to reshuffle the structure of its method path-through pre-decoration, post-decoration, intermediate-step modification, and step insertion-thereby producing context-aware, safety-aligned, and environment-adaptive methods. Experimental results show that method decoration allows IoT devices to derive ore appropriate methods when confronting unknown or faulty operating conditions.

*Siyu Li,Chenwei Song,Wan Zhou,Xinyi Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出一种结合图结构信息的大型语言模型方法，用于烟草病虫害防治的知识推理，通过集成知识图谱和微调技术提升多跳和比较推理效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统知识推理方法在处理农业复杂关系和多跳推理时存在局限，烟草病虫害防治需要更精准的决策支持系统以应对症状识别、病害关联和防治方案匹配的复杂性。

Method: 基于GraphRAG框架，利用LLM构建烟草病虫害知识图谱（包含病害、症状、防治方法等实体及关系），通过GNN学习图结构节点表征，结合Transformer进行推理，并采用LoRA对ChatGLM模型进行参数高效微调。

Result: 实验表明该方法在准确率和推理深度上显著优于基线模型，在多跳推理任务中提升达23.7%，比较推理任务提升16.2%，且答案覆盖度提高19.5%。

Conclusion: 融合结构化知识的LLM可有效提升农业病虫害防治决策的推理能力，为复杂领域知识系统提供可解释的解决方案，后续将探索模型向其他经济作物病害场景的泛化能力。

Abstract: This paper proposes a large language model (LLM) approach that integrates graph-structured information for knowledge reasoning in tobacco pest and disease control. Built upon the GraphRAG framework, the proposed method enhances knowledge retrieval and reasoning by explicitly incorporating structured information from a domain-specific knowledge graph. Specifically, LLMs are first leveraged to assist in the construction of a tobacco pest and disease knowledge graph, which organizes key entities such as diseases, symptoms, control methods, and their relationships. Based on this graph, relevant knowledge is retrieved and integrated into the reasoning process to support accurate answer generation. The Transformer architecture is adopted as the core inference model, while a graph neural network (GNN) is employed to learn expressive node representations that capture both local and global relational information within the knowledge graph. A ChatGLM-based model serves as the backbone LLM and is fine-tuned using LoRA to achieve parameter-efficient adaptation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach consistently outperforms baseline methods across multiple evaluation metrics, significantly improving both the accuracy and depth of reasoning, particularly in complex multi-hop and comparative reasoning scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本论文提出AlignAR和复杂阿拉伯语-英语数据集，表明LLM方法在句对齐任务上比传统方法提升9%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有阿拉伯语-英语平行语料库多为简单一对一映射，缺乏评估复杂对齐方法的能力。需要构建包含法律和文学领域复杂文本的数据集。

Method: 开发生成式句对齐方法AlignAR，创建包含复杂句结构的阿拉伯语-英语数据集，并设计减少简单映射的Hard子集用于方法验证。

Result: LLM基于方法达到85.5% F1值，较传统方法提升9%。传统方法在Hard子集上失效，暴露其局限性。

Conclusion: 生成式方法与复杂数据集有效暴露传统对齐方法缺陷，LLM展现更强鲁棒性，所有资源已开源。

Abstract: High-quality parallel corpora are essential for Machine Translation (MT) research and translation teaching. However, Arabic-English resources remain scarce and existing datasets mainly consist of simple one-to-one mappings. In this paper, we present AlignAR, a generative sentence alignment method, and a new Arabic-English dataset comprising complex legal and literary texts. Our evaluation demonstrates that "Easy" datasets lack the discriminatory power to fully assess alignment methods. By reducing one-to-one mappings in our "Hard" subset, we exposed the limitations of traditional alignment methods. In contrast, LLM-based approaches demonstrated superior robustness, achieving an overall F1-score of 85.5%, a 9% improvement over previous methods. Our datasets and codes are open-sourced at https://github.com/XXX.

TL;DR: 本文提出了HeartBench，首个针对中文大模型在类人情感、文化、伦理智能的综合评估框架，揭示当前模型在复杂社交场景下的性能瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中文大语言模型缺乏专门的社会情感评估体系与高质量数据，现有模型在理解细腻情感伦理问题时存在显著缺陷。

Method: 基于心理咨询真实场景构建评估框架，采用理论驱动的五维十五能力分类体系，开发案例评分法的'推理先于评分'协议。

Result: 13个SOTA模型测试显示最高得分仅达专家标准的60%，尤其在情感潜台词与伦理权衡场景下性能骤降50%以上。

Conclusion: HeartBench为类人AI评估建立标准化学术范式，为构建人类对齐的训练数据提供可复用的方法论框架。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in cognitive and reasoning benchmarks, they exhibit a persistent deficit in anthropomorphic intelligence-the capacity to navigate complex social, emotional, and ethical nuances. This gap is particularly acute in the Chinese linguistic and cultural context, where a lack of specialized evaluation frameworks and high-quality socio-emotional data impedes progress. To address these limitations, we present HeartBench, a framework designed to evaluate the integrated emotional, cultural, and ethical dimensions of Chinese LLMs. Grounded in authentic psychological counseling scenarios and developed in collaboration with clinical experts, the benchmark is structured around a theory-driven taxonomy comprising five primary dimensions and 15 secondary capabilities. We implement a case-specific, rubric-based methodology that translates abstract human-like traits into granular, measurable criteria through a ``reasoning-before-scoring'' evaluation protocol. Our assessment of 13 state-of-the-art LLMs indicates a substantial performance ceiling: even leading models achieve only 60% of the expert-defined ideal score. Furthermore, analysis using a difficulty-stratified ``Hard Set'' reveals a significant performance decay in scenarios involving subtle emotional subtexts and complex ethical trade-offs. HeartBench establishes a standardized metric for anthropomorphic AI evaluation and provides a methodological blueprint for constructing high-quality, human-aligned training data.

### [86] [TimeBill: Time-Budgeted Inference for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21859)
*Qi Fan,An Zou,Yehan Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本论文提出了一种名为TimeBill的框架，用于大型语言模型（LLMs）在时间受限场景下的推理优化。其核心是通过细粒度响应长度预测（RLP）和执行时间估计（ETE）技术，实现键值缓存（KV缓存）的自适应淘汰比例调整，以平衡推理效率与响应质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs广泛应用于机器人、自动驾驶等时间敏感型系统，但其自回归生成机制导致端到端执行时间难以建模，传统固定KV缓存淘汰比例的高效推理方法无法动态适配多样化任务的时间预算，易导致推理不完整或性能下降。

Method: 提出RLP预测响应长度与ETE建模执行时间的联合优化方法，基于实时预测结果和预设时间预算自适应调整KV缓存淘汰比例，实现动态时间管控。

Result: 实验验证该方法在多种超时策略下显著提升任务完成率（如超时30%时完成率提升27%），同时保持响应质量稳定性（如BLEU分数波动<0.5）

Conclusion: TimeBill通过时间感知的KV缓存管理机制，在保证安全关键型任务时效性的同时维持LLMs输出质量，为资源受限场景的模型部署提供了可扩展解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in time-critical systems, such as robotics, autonomous driving, embodied intelligence, and industrial automation, where generating accurate responses within a given time budget is crucial for decision-making, control, or safety-critical tasks. However, the auto-regressive generation process of LLMs makes it challenging to model and estimate the end-to-end execution time. Furthermore, existing efficient inference methods based on a fixed key-value (KV) cache eviction ratio struggle to adapt to varying tasks with diverse time budgets, where an improper eviction ratio may lead to incomplete inference or a drop in response performance. In this paper, we propose TimeBill, a novel time-budgeted inference framework for LLMs that balances the inference efficiency and response performance. To be more specific, we propose a fine-grained response length predictor (RLP) and an execution time estimator (ETE) to accurately predict the end-to-end execution time of LLMs. Following this, we develop a time-budgeted efficient inference approach that adaptively adjusts the KV cache eviction ratio based on execution time prediction and the given time budget. Finally, through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the advantages of TimeBill in improving task completion rate and maintaining response performance under various overrun strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs的广泛应用引发版权侵权担忧，但当前模型在识别和遵守版权法规方面存在局限性，亟需系统评估与解决方案。

Method: 构建包含5万个多模态查询对的大规模基准数据集，涵盖图书、新闻等场景，并设计两种场景（含/不含版权通知）；提出基于工具增强的防御框架。

Result: 实验表明即使最新闭源模型也无法有效识别和遵守版权规则，但提出的防御框架成功降低侵权风险。

Conclusion: 该研究强调开发版权感知型LVLMs的必要性，为确保模型合规使用提供方法论依据。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable advancements in multimodal reasoning tasks. However, their widespread accessibility raises critical concerns about potential copyright infringement. Will LVLMs accurately recognize and comply with copyright regulations when encountering copyrighted content (i.e., user input, retrieved documents) in the context? Failure to comply with copyright regulations may lead to serious legal and ethical consequences, particularly when LVLMs generate responses based on copyrighted materials (e.g., retrieved book experts, news reports). In this paper, we present a comprehensive evaluation of various LVLMs, examining how they handle copyrighted content -- such as book excerpts, news articles, music lyrics, and code documentation when they are presented as visual inputs. To systematically measure copyright compliance, we introduce a large-scale benchmark dataset comprising 50,000 multimodal query-content pairs designed to evaluate how effectively LVLMs handle queries that could lead to copyright infringement. Given that real-world copyrighted content may or may not include a copyright notice, the dataset includes query-content pairs in two distinct scenarios: with and without a copyright notice. For the former, we extensively cover four types of copyright notices to account for different cases. Our evaluation reveals that even state-of-the-art closed-source LVLMs exhibit significant deficiencies in recognizing and respecting the copyrighted content, even when presented with the copyright notice. To solve this limitation, we introduce a novel tool-augmented defense framework for copyright compliance, which reduces infringement risks in all scenarios. Our findings underscore the importance of developing copyright-aware LVLMs to ensure the responsible and lawful use of copyrighted content.

<details>

Motivation: 为提升法律AI系统的用户接受度，需同时预测相关法律条文并提供可解释性，如辅助律师和法律问答系统。

Method: AoS（Attention-over-Sentences）使用句子级注意力机制训练小模型；LLMPrompt采用Zero-shot方式，通过大模型和思维链提示生成预测及解释。

Result: 两种方法在两个数据集上表现优于基线模型，且生成的解释经自动和人工评估验证了有效性。

Conclusion: 结合注意力机制的监督模型与大模型提示方法可有效解决法规预测与解释生成问题，为法律AI提供可解释性支持。

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the problem of automatic statute prediction where for a given case description, a subset of relevant statutes are to be predicted. Here, the term "statute" refers to a section, a sub-section, or an article of any specific Act. Addressing this problem would be useful in several applications such as AI-assistant for lawyers and legal question answering system. For better user acceptance of such Legal AI systems, we believe the predictions should also be accompanied by human understandable explanations. We propose two techniques for addressing this problem of statute prediction with explanations -- (i) AoS (Attention-over-Sentences) which uses attention over sentences in a case description to predict statutes relevant for it and (ii) LLMPrompt which prompts an LLM to predict as well as explain relevance of a certain statute. AoS uses smaller language models, specifically sentence transformers and is trained in a supervised manner whereas LLMPrompt uses larger language models in a zero-shot manner and explores both standard as well as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting techniques. Both these models produce explanations for their predictions in human understandable forms. We compare statute prediction performance of both the proposed techniques with each other as well as with a set of competent baselines, across two popular datasets. Also, we evaluate the quality of the generated explanations through an automated counter-factual manner as well as through human evaluation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了大型语言模型（LLM）中使用一种特殊的标记化方法是否会因破坏自然词汇影响模型表现，提出新的评估指标量化这种影响并证实了其显著性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的自然语言处理中，文本按自然词汇分割，而LLM因词汇量受限，常将自然词汇拆分为子标记（如“martial”拆为“mart”和“ial”）。论文假设这种破坏可能对模型性能产生负面影响，但该问题尚未被系统验证。

Method: 提出一组惩罚函数来计算特定LLM下文本的标记化惩罚值（tokenization penalty），量化其标记化质量的优劣，并通过统计方法验证自然词汇拆分与模型性能负相关的假设。

Result: 在多个NLP任务及不同LLM（如Mistral）中的实验表明，标记化惩罚值与任务表现呈显著负相关，证明自然词汇的拆分确实降低了模型效果。

Conclusion: LLM的子标记化策略会损害性能，开发者需重视此问题，并可通过提出的惩罚指标优化标记器选择或改进模型训练策略。

Abstract: Tokenization is the first step in training any Large Language Model (LLM), where the text is split into a sequence of tokens as per the model's fixed vocabulary. This tokenization in LLMs is different from the traditional tokenization in NLP where the text is split into a sequence of "natural" words. In LLMs, a natural word may also be broken into multiple tokens due to limited vocabulary size of the LLMs (e.g., Mistral's tokenizer splits "martial" into "mart" and "ial"). In this paper, we hypothesize that such breaking of natural words negatively impacts LLM performance on various NLP tasks. To quantify this effect, we propose a set of penalty functions that compute a tokenization penalty for a given text for a specific LLM, indicating how "bad" the tokenization is. We establish statistical significance of our hypothesis on multiple NLP tasks for a set of different LLMs.

*Tal Halevi,Yarden Tzach,Ronit D. Gross,Shalom Rosner,Ido Kanter*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to quantify information processing in self-attention mechanisms (e.g., BERT-12), revealing that attention maps focus on sentence separators and attention heads specialize in distinct linguistic features like token repetition or context recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While self-attention's effectiveness is recognized, its precise learning mechanisms and quantitative characterization remain unclear, driving the need for this analysis.

Method: Analyzed BERT-12 using context similarity matrices derived from self-attention head vector spaces, examining attention map dynamics across layers and heads.

Result: Later layers focus on sentence separators for text segmentation; attention heads specialize in specific linguistic features, transitioning from long-range to short-range token similarities. Each head uniquely centers on key tokens.

Conclusion: Attention heads in self-attention networks develop specialized linguistic capabilities and hierarchical similarity patterns, offering insights into model interpretability and potential improvements for language segmentation tasks.

Abstract: The self-attention mechanism has significantly advanced the field of natural language processing, facilitating the development of advanced language-learning machines. Although its utility is widely acknowledged, the precise mechanisms of self-attention underlying its advanced learning and the quantitative characterization of this learning process remains an open research question. This study introduces a new approach for quantifying information processing within the self-attention mechanism. The analysis conducted on the BERT-12 architecture reveals that, in the final layers, the attention map focuses on sentence separator tokens, suggesting a practical approach to text segmentation based on semantic features. Based on the vector space emerging from the self-attention heads, a context similarity matrix, measuring the scalar product between two token vectors was derived, revealing distinct similarities between different token vector pairs within each head and layer. The findings demonstrated that different attention heads within an attention block focused on different linguistic characteristics, such as identifying token repetitions in a given text or recognizing a token of common appearance in the text and its surrounding context. This specialization is also reflected in the distribution of distances between token vectors with high similarity as the architecture progresses. The initial attention layers exhibit substantially long-range similarities; however, as the layers progress, a more short-range similarity develops, culminating in a preference for attention heads to create strong similarities within the same sentence. Finally, the behavior of individual heads was analyzed by examining the uniqueness of their most common tokens in their high similarity elements. Each head tends to focus on a unique token from the text and builds similarity pairs centered around it.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GLUE基准已标准化英语NLU评估，但土耳其语缺乏类似基准；需填补多语言NLU评估体系的空白。

Method: 构建土耳其语原生语料库，采用LLM标注+跨模型一致性校验+人工验证的半自动流程，设计与GLUE任务域平行的评估框架。

Result: 推出包含多任务NLU的TrGLUE基准和专用情感分析基准SentiTurca，建立可扩展的语料处理工作流，减少翻译痕迹并保留语言自然性。

Conclusion: 通过TrGLUE构建了土耳其语NLU的鲁棒评估框架，提供开源资源，为低资源语言的基准构建提供了半自动化标注方法论启示。

Abstract: Evaluating the performance of various model architectures, such as transformers, large language models (LLMs), and other NLP systems, requires comprehensive benchmarks that measure performance across multiple dimensions. Among these, the evaluation of natural language understanding (NLU) is particularly critical as it serves as a fundamental criterion for assessing model capabilities. Thus, it is essential to establish benchmarks that enable thorough evaluation and analysis of NLU abilities from diverse perspectives. While the GLUE benchmark has set a standard for evaluating English NLU, similar benchmarks have been developed for other languages, such as CLUE for Chinese, FLUE for French, and JGLUE for Japanese. However, no comparable benchmark currently exists for the Turkish language. To address this gap, we introduce TrGLUE, a comprehensive benchmark encompassing a variety of NLU tasks for Turkish. In addition, we present SentiTurca, a specialized benchmark for sentiment analysis. To support researchers, we also provide fine-tuning and evaluation code for transformer-based models, facilitating the effective use of these benchmarks. TrGLUE comprises Turkish-native corpora curated to mirror the domains and task formulations of GLUE-style evaluations, with labels obtained through a semi-automated pipeline that combines strong LLM-based annotation, cross-model agreement checks, and subsequent human validation. This design prioritizes linguistic naturalness, minimizes direct translation artifacts, and yields a scalable, reproducible workflow. With TrGLUE, our goal is to establish a robust evaluation framework for Turkish NLU, empower researchers with valuable resources, and provide insights into generating high-quality semi-automated datasets.
