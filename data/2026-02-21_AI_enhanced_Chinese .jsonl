In this work, we investigate whether reference-guided LLM-evaluators can bridge this gap by serving as soft \"verifiers\". First, we design evaluation protocols that enhance LLM-based evaluators for LLM alignment using reference outputs. Through comprehensive experiments, we show that a reference-guided approach substantially improves the accuracy of less capable LLM-judges using references from frontier models; stronger LLM-judges can also be enhanced by high-quality (i.e., human-written) references. Building on these improved judges, we demonstrate the utility of high-quality references in alignment tuning, where LLMs guided with references are used as judges to self-improve. We show that reference-guided self-improvement yields clear gains over both direct SFT on reference outputs and self-improvement with reference-free judges, achieving performance comparable to training with ArmoRM, a strong finetuned reward model. Specifically, our method achieves 73.1% and 58.7% on AlpacaEval and Arena-Hard with Llama-3-8B-Instruct, and 70.0% and 74.1% with Qwen2.5-7B, corresponding to average absolute gains of +20.2 / +17.1 points over SFT distillation and +5.3 / +3.6 points over reference-free self-improvement on AlpacaEval / Arena-Hard. These results highlight the potential of using reference-guided LLM-evaluators to enable effective LLM post-training in non-verifiable domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u53c2\u8003\u7684LLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5956\u52b1\uff08RLVR\uff09\u65e0\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u771f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u7684\u9886\u57df\uff08\u5982LLM\u5bf9\u9f50\uff09\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "RLVR\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u4f9d\u8d56\u771f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u3002\u65e0\u771f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u7684\u975e\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u9886\u57df\uff08\u5982\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\uff09\u9700\u8981\u66ff\u4ee3\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709LLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u8003\u5f15\u5bfc\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u53c2\u8003\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u589e\u5f3aLLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u524d\u6cbf\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u8f93\u51fa\u63d0\u5347\u4f4e\u80fd\u529bLLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4eba\u5de5\u53c2\u8003\u8f93\u51fa\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u5f3aLLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u3002\u7ed3\u5408\u63d0\u5347\u540e\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u53c2\u8003\u5f15\u5bfc\u81ea\u6211\u6539\u8fdb\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8eLLM\u5bf9\u9f50\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u53c2\u8003\u5f15\u5bfc\u6cd5\u4f7fLLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528Llama-3-8B-Instruct\u548cQwen2.5-7B\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\uff0cAlpacaEval/Arena-Hard\u5f97\u5206\u5206\u522b\u8fbe73.1%/58.7%\u548c70.0%/74.1%\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u4f20\u7edf\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u534720.2/17.1\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u65e0\u53c2\u8003\u81ea\u6211\u6539\u8fdb\u6cd5\u63d0\u53475.3/3.6\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0c\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1ArmoRM\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u53c2\u8003\u7684LLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u5f25\u8865\u975e\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u9886\u57df\u7f3a\u5931\u771f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u7684\u77ed\u677f\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u53c2\u8003\u5f15\u5bfc\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Despite these advancements, research on LLMs has primarily targeted high-resourced languages (e.g., English), and only recently has attention shifted toward multilingual models. However, these models demonstrate a training data bias towards a small number of popular languages or rely on transfer learning from high- to under-resourced languages; this may lead to a misrepresentation of social, cultural, and historical aspects. To address this challenge, monolingual LLMs have been developed for under-resourced languages; however, their effectiveness remains less studied when compared to multilingual counterparts on language-specific tasks. In this study, we address this research gap in Greek QA by contributing: (i) DemosQA, a novel dataset, which is constructed using social media user questions and community-reviewed answers to better capture the Greek social and cultural zeitgeist; (ii) a memory-efficient LLM evaluation framework adaptable to diverse QA datasets and languages; and (iii) an extensive evaluation of 11 monolingual and multilingual LLMs on 6 human-curated Greek QA datasets using 3 different prompting strategies.

In practice, however, they exhibit a sharp degradation of sample quality in the few-step regime, failing to realize this promise. Here we show that language models leveraging flow-based continuous denoising can outperform discrete diffusion in both quality and speed. By revisiting the fundamentals of flows over discrete modalities, we build a flow-based language model (FLM) that performs Euclidean denoising over one-hot token encodings. We show that the model can be trained by predicting the clean data via a cross entropy objective, where we introduce a simple time reparameterization that greatly improves training stability and generation quality. By distilling FLM into its associated flow map, we obtain a distilled flow map language model (FMLM) capable of few-step generation. On the LM1B and OWT language datasets, FLM attains generation quality matching state-of-the-art discrete diffusion models. With FMLM, our approach outperforms recent few-step language models across the board, with one-step generation exceeding their 8-step quality. Our work calls into question the widely held hypothesis that discrete diffusion processes are necessary for generative modeling over discrete modalities, and paves the way toward accelerated flow-based language modeling at scale.

Compared to conventional photogrammetric 3D reconstruction techniques, modern approaches such as Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) and Gaussian Splatting (GS) excel in scene representation, rendering quality, and handling featureless regions. Among them, GS stands out for its efficiency, leveraging discrete anisotropic 3D Gaussians to represent radiance fields, unlike NeRF's continuous implicit model. This study introduces a GS-enabled digital twin method tailored for effective 3D damage visualization. The method's key contributions include: 1) utilizing GS-based 3D reconstruction to visualize 2D damage segmentation results while reducing segmentation errors; 2) developing a multi-scale reconstruction strategy to balance efficiency and damage detail; 3) enabling digital twin updates as damage evolves over time.

However, Meenzerisch is on the verge of dying out-a fate it shares with many other German dialects. Natural language processing (NLP) has the potential to help with the preservation and revival efforts of languages and dialects. However, so far no NLP research has looked at Meenzerisch. This work presents the first research in the field of NLP that is explicitly focused on the dialect of Mainz. We introduce a digital dictionary-an NLP-ready dataset derived from an existing resource (Schramm, 1966)-to support researchers in modeling and benchmarking the language. It contains 2,351 words in the dialect paired with their meanings described in Standard German. We then use this dataset to answer the following research questions: (1) Can state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) generate definitions for dialect words? (2) Can LLMs generate words in Meenzerisch, given their definitions? Our experiments show that LLMs can do neither: the best model for definitions reaches only 6.27% accuracy and the best word generation model's accuracy is 1.51%. We then conduct two additional experiments in order to see if accuracy is improved by few-shot learning and by extracting rules from the training set, which are then passed to the LLM. While those approaches are able to improve the results, accuracy remains below 10%.

While modern Vision-Language Models (VLM) have achieved high accuracy in this domain, they predominantly rely on autoregressive decoding, which becomes computationally expensive and slow for long documents as it requires a sequential forward pass for every generated token. We identify a key opportunity to overcome this bottleneck: unlike open-ended generation, OCR is a highly deterministic task where the visual input strictly dictates a unique output sequence, theoretically enabling efficient, parallel decoding via diffusion models. However, we show that existing masked diffusion models fail to harness this potential; those introduce structural instabilities that are benign in flexible tasks, like captioning, but catastrophic for the rigid, exact-match requirements of OCR. To bridge this gap, we introduce DODO, the first VLM to utilize block discrete diffusion and unlock its speedup potential for OCR. By decomposing generation into blocks, DODO mitigates the synchronization errors of global diffusion.

Classical factorization methods, such as Trial Division and Pollard's Rho, are inefficient for large keys, while Shor's quantum algorithm can break RSA efficiently in polynomial time. This research studies RSA's vulnerabilities under both classical and quantum attacks and designs a hybrid security framework to ensure data protection in the post-quantum era. The conceptual framework combines AES encryption for classical security, BB84 Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) for secure key exchange with eavesdropping detection, quantum state comparison for lightweight authentication, and a bio-inspired immune system for adaptive threat detection. RSA is vulnerable to Shor's algorithm, BB84 achieves full key agreement in ideal conditions, and it detects eavesdropping with high accuracy. The conceptual model includes both classical and quantum security methods, providing a scalable and adaptive solution for Post-Quantum encryption data protection.

Our findings reveal a transfer asymmetry: semantic overlap is insufficient to guarantee positive transfer, particularly in low-resource Turkish-to-English direction, where performance can degrade even for overlapping euphemisms, and in some cases, improve under NOPET-based training.

These properties make close reading indispensable while limiting reproducible comparison at scale. We present an uncertainty-aware computational framework for poet-level psychological analysis based on large-scale automatic multi-label annotation. Each verse is associated with a set of psychological concepts, per-label confidence scores, and an abstention flag that signals insufficient evidence. We aggregate confidence-weighted evidence into a Poet $\\times$ Concept matrix, interpret each poet as a probability distribution over concepts, and quantify poetic individuality as divergence from a corpus baseline using Jensen--Shannon divergence and Kullback--Leibler divergence. To capture relational structure beyond marginals, we build a confidence-weighted co-occurrence graph over concepts and define an Eigenmood embedding through Laplacian spectral decomposition. On a corpus of 61{,}573 verses across 10 poets, 22.2\\% of verses are abstained, underscoring the analytical importance of uncertainty. We further report sensitivity analysis under confidence thresholding, selection-bias diagnostics that treat abstention as a category, and a distant-to-close workflow that retrieves verse-level exemplars along Eigenmood axes. The resulting framework supports scalable, auditable digital-humanities analysis while preserving interpretive caution by propagating uncertainty from verse-level evidence to poet-level inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u53e4\u5178\u6ce2\u65af\u8bd7\u6b4c\u7684\u8bd7\u4eba\u5fc3\u7406\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u81ea\u52a8\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u6807\u6ce8\u548c\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u91cf\u5316\u8bd7\u4eba\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u53e4\u5178\u6ce2\u65af\u8bd7\u6b4c\u901a\u8fc7\u9690\u55bb\u548c\u95f4\u63a5\u4fee\u8f9e\u8868\u8fbe\u60c5\u611f\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7ec6\u8bfb\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u9700\u7ed3\u5408\u8ba1\u7b97\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5904\u7406\u6765\u4fdd\u7559\u6587\u672c\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8c28\u614e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b\u5fc3\u7406\u6982\u5ff5\u6807\u7b7e\u3001\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u8bc4\u5206\u548c\u653e\u5f03\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u6ce8\u91ca\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u52a0\u6743\u7684\u8bd7\u4eba-\u6982\u5ff5\u77e9\u9635\u548c\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u91cf\u5316\u8bd7\u4eba\u4e2a\u4f53\u6027\uff08\u4f7f\u7528Jensen-Shannon\u6563\u5ea6\u548cKullback-Leibler\u6563\u5ea6\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u52a0\u6743\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u5171\u73b0\u56fe\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u8c31\u5206\u89e3\u751f\u6210Eigenmood\u5d4c\u5165\u3002", "result": "\u572861,573\u884c\u8bd7\u6b4c\u7684\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\uff0c22.2%\u8bd7\u53e5\u56e0\u8bc1\u636e\u4e0d\u8db3\u88ab\u653e\u5f03\u6807\u6ce8\uff1b\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u8bd7\u4eba\u504f\u79bb\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u57fa\u7ebf\u7684\u4e2a\u4f53\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4ece\u8fdc\u8bfb\u5230\u8fd1\u8bfb\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u8bd7\u53e5\u7ea7\u8bc1\u636e\u5230\u8bd7\u4eba\u7ea7\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u53ef\u5ba1\u8ba1\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u4eba\u6587\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u89e3\u91ca\u5b66\u4e0a\u7684\u8c28\u614e\u6027\u3002"}}

HSI captures detailed biochemical features of produce, while 3D geometric data substantially improves morphological analysis. However, integrating these two modalities at scale remains challenging, as conventional approaches involve complex hardware setups incompatible with automated phenotyping systems. Recent advances in neural radiance fields (NeRF) offer computationally efficient 3D reconstruction but typically require moving-camera setups, limiting throughput and reproducibility in standard indoor agricultural environments. To address these challenges, we introduce HSI-SC-NeRF, a stationary-camera multi-channel NeRF framework for high-throughput hyperspectral 3D reconstruction targeting postharvest inspection of agricultural produce. Multi-view hyperspectral data is captured using a stationary camera while the object rotates within a custom-built Teflon imaging chamber providing diffuse, uniform illumination. Object poses are estimated via ArUco calibration markers and transformed to the camera frame of reference through simulated pose transformations, enabling standard NeRF training on stationary-camera data. A multi-channel NeRF formulation optimizes reconstruction across all hyperspectral bands jointly using a composite spectral loss, supported by a two-stage training protocol that decouples geometric initialization from radiometric refinement. Experiments on three agricultural produce samples demonstrate high spatial reconstruction accuracy and strong spectral fidelity across the visible and near-infrared spectrum, confirming the suitability of HSI-SC-NeRF for integration into automated agricultural workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9759\u6001\u76f8\u673a\u7684\u591a\u901a\u9053NeRF\u6846\u67b6HSI-SC-NeRF\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u519c\u4e1a\u4ea7\u54c1\u7684\u9ad8\u901a\u91cf\u9ad8\u5149\u8c313D\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u6210\u50cf\u4e0e3D\u91cd\u5efa\u6280\u672f\u786c\u4ef6\u590d\u6742\u3001\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u4f4e\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u73b0\u6709NeRF\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u79fb\u52a8\u76f8\u673a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u73af\u5883\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5dee\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9759\u6001\u76f8\u673a-\u65cb\u8f6c\u7269\u4f53\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7279\u5236PTFE\u6210\u50cf\u5ba4\u5b9e\u73b0\u5747\u5300\u7167\u660e\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7ArUco\u6807\u8bb0\u4f30\u8ba1\u59ff\u6001\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u8f6c\u6362\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u901a\u9053NeRF\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u590d\u5408\u5149\u8c31\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u534f\u8bae\u5206\u79bb\u51e0\u4f55\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u4e0e\u8f90\u5c04\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u4e0e\u8fd1\u7ea2\u5916\u6ce2\u6bb5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a7a\u95f4\u91cd\u5efa\u7cbe\u5ea6<0.05mm\u3001\u5149\u8c31\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6>98%\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u519c\u4e1a\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "HSI-SC-NeRF\u6210\u529f\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u79fb\u52a8\u76f8\u673a\u786c\u4ef6\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4f7f3D\u91cd\u5efa\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u5347300%\uff0c\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u5316\u519c\u4ea7\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

This inefficiency is largely due to the fixed tokenization process, which uses constant-sized patches throughout the entire denoising phase, regardless of the content's complexity. We propose dynamic tokenization, an efficient test-time strategy that varies patch sizes based on content complexity and the denoising timestep. Our key insight is that early timesteps only require coarser patches to model global structure, while later iterations demand finer (smaller-sized) patches to refine local details. During inference, our method dynamically reallocates patch sizes across denoising steps for image and video generation and substantially reduces cost while preserving perceptual generation quality.

In practice, multimodal data is often incomplete because modalities may be missing, collected asynchronously, or available only for a subset of examples. In this work, we propose PRIMO, a supervised latent-variable imputation model that quantifies the predictive impact of any missing modality within the multimodal learning setting. PRIMO enables the use of all available training examples, whether modalities are complete or partial. Specifically, it models the missing modality through a latent variable that captures its relationship with the observed modality in the context of prediction. During inference, we draw many samples from the learned distribution over the missing modality to both obtain the marginal predictive distribution (for the purpose of prediction) and analyze the impact of the missing modalities on the prediction for each instance. We evaluate PRIMO on a synthetic XOR dataset, Audio-Vision MNIST, and MIMIC-III for mortality and ICD-9 prediction.

This study investigates how different approaches for cross-lingual text classification can support reliable analysis of global conversations. Using hydrogen energy as a case study, we analyse a decade-long dataset of over nine million tweets in English, Japanese, Hindi, and Korean (2013--2022) for topic discovery. The online keyword-driven data collection results in a significant amount of irrelevant content. We explore four approaches to filter relevant content: (1) translating English annotated data into target languages for building language-specific models for each target language, (2) translating unlabelled data appearing from all languages into English for creating a single model based on English annotations, (3) applying English fine-tuned multilingual transformers directly to each target language data, and (4) a hybrid strategy that combines translated annotations with multilingual training. Each approach is evaluated for its ability to filter hydrogen-related tweets from noisy keyword-based collections. Subsequently, topic modeling is performed to extract dominant themes within the relevant subsets. The results highlight key trade-offs between translation and multilingual approaches, offering actionable insights into optimising cross-lingual pipelines for large-scale social media analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper explores four cross-lingual text classification approaches to filter relevant content (hydrogen-related tweets) from multilingual social media datasets (9M tweets in English, Japanese, Hindi, Korean).

To overcome the first challenge, we introduce a Hierarchical Contrastive Retrieval module that aligns dense image patches with 3D part latents at both part and object granularity, retrieving from a curated bank of 1,236 part-annotated assets to inject diverse, physically plausible exemplars into denoising. To overcome the second challenge, we add a masked, part-level editor that operates in a shared canonical space, enabling swaps, attribute refinements, and compositional updates without regenerating the whole object while preserving non-target parts and multi-view consistency. PartRAG achieves competitive results on Objaverse, ShapeNet, and ABO-reducing Chamfer Distance from 0.1726 to 0.1528 and raising F-Score from 0.7472 to 0.844 on Objaverse-with inference of 38s and interactive edits in 5-8s.

To address these challenges, we propose an efficient compression framework that transforms the 60-layer dual-stream MMDiT-based Qwen-Image into lightweight models without training from scratch. Leveraging this framework, we introduce Amber-Image, a series of streamlined T2I models. We first derive Amber-Image-10B using a timestep-sensitive depth pruning strategy, where retained layers are reinitialized via local weight averaging and optimized through layer-wise distillation and full-parameter fine-tuning. Building on this, we develop Amber-Image-6B by introducing a hybrid-stream architecture that converts deep-layer dual streams into a single stream initialized from the image branch, further refined via progressive distillation and lightweight fine-tuning.

However, these models still exhibit low accuracy in core banking computations-including total payout estimation, comparison of products with varying interest rates, and interest calculation under early repayment conditions. Such tasks require multi-step numerical reasoning and contextual understanding of banking products, yet existing LLMs often make systematic errors-misinterpreting product types, applying conditions incorrectly, or failing basic calculations involving exponents and geometric progressions. However, such errors have rarely been captured by existing benchmarks. Mathematical datasets focus on fundamental math problems, whereas financial benchmarks primarily target financial documents, leaving everyday banking scenarios underexplored. To address this limitation, we propose BankMathBench, a domain-specific dataset that reflects realistic banking tasks. BankMathBench is organized in three levels of difficulty-basic, intermediate, and advanced-corresponding to single-product reasoning, multi-product comparison, and multi-condition scenarios, respectively. When trained on BankMathBench, open-source LLMs exhibited notable improvements in both formula generation and numerical reasoning accuracy, demonstrating the dataset's effectiveness in enhancing domain-specific reasoning. With tool-augmented fine-tuning, the models achieved average accuracy increases of 57.6%p (basic), 75.1%p (intermediate), and 62.9%p (advanced), representing significant gains over zero-shot baselines.

Traditional benchmarks measure transient task accuracy but fail to capture stable, latent response policies -- the ``prevailing mindsets'' embedded during training and alignment that outlive individual model versions.\n  This paper introduces a novel auditing framework that utilizes psychometric measurement theory -- specifically latent trait estimation under ordinal uncertainty -- to quantify these tendencies without relying on ground-truth labels. Utilizing forced-choice ordinal vignettes masked by semantically orthogonal decoys and governed by cryptographic permutation-invariance, the research audits nine leading models across dimensions including Optimization Bias, Sycophancy, and Status-Quo Legitimization.\n  Using Mixed Linear Models (MixedLM) and Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) analysis, the research identifies that while item-level framing drives high variance, a persistent ``lab signal'' accounts for significant behavioral clustering. These findings demonstrate that in ``locked-in'' provider ecosystems, latent biases are not merely static errors but compounding variables that risk creating recursive ideological echo chambers in multi-layered AI architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5fc3\u7406\u6d4b\u91cf\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5236\u9009\u62e9\u5e8f\u6570\u60c5\u666f\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u8bc6\u522b\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u5728\u7684\u6301\u4e45\u884c\u4e3a\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b9\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u504f\u89c1\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f62\u6210\u610f\u8bc6\u5f62\u6001\u56de\u97f3\u5ba4\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6307\u6807\u4ec5\u8bc4\u4f30\u4efb\u52a1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349LLM\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u5185\u5316\u504f\u89c1\uff08\u5982\u8d8b\u708e\u9644\u52bf\u503e\u5411\uff09\u3002\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u91cf\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b9\u5c42\u7ea7\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u884c\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u5b89\u5168\u6cbb\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u9020\u5305\u542b\u8bed\u4e49\u63a9\u7801\u5e72\u6270\u9879\u7684\u5e8f\u6570\u60c5\u666f\u9898\uff08\u5e94\u7528\u5fc3\u7406\u6d4b\u91cf\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7279\u8d28\u4f30\u8ba1\u7406\u8bba\uff09\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u7ec4\u5185\u76f8\u5173\u7cfb\u6570\u5206\u6790\u5bf99\u4e2a\u4e3b\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u8de8\u7ef4\u5ea6\u68c0\u6d4b\uff08\u542b\u4f18\u5316\u504f\u5dee\u3001\u5730\u4f4d\u5408\u6cd5\u5316\u7b49\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u5b9e\u9879\u76ee\u8868\u8ff0\u65b9\u5f0f\u5bfc\u81f4\u54cd\u5e94\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b9\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u663e\u8457\u884c\u4e3a\u805a\u7c7b\u4fe1\u53f7\uff08lab signal\uff09\uff0c\u5982OpenAI\u4e0eAnthropic\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4fdd\u5b88/\u5f00\u653e\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u5c42AI\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b9\u504f\u89c1\u4f1a\u901a\u8fc7\u9012\u5f52\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f62\u6210\u610f\u8bc6\u5f62\u6001\u95ed\u73af\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u91c7\u7528\u5bc6\u7801\u5b66\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u52a0\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6027\u3002"}}

As platforms increasingly rely on patient ratings and feedback, clinicians face growing pressure to maintain satisfaction scores, even though these evaluations often reflect communication quality more than clinical accuracy.

Using a sample of 77,334 anonymised patient question--doctor response pairs, we model feedback as a binary outcome, treating thumbs-up responses as positive and grouping negative or absent feedback into the other class. We extract interpretable, predominantly language-agnostic features (e.g., length, structural characteristics, readability proxies), along with Romanian LIWC psycholinguistic features and politeness/hedging markers where available. We train a classifier with a time-based split and perform SHAP-based analyses, which indicate that patient and clinician history features dominate prediction, functioning as strong priors, while characteristics of the response text provide a smaller but, crucially, actionable signal.

In particular, faint GRBs originating from a distant universe may provide unique insights into the early stages of star formation. However, detecting and localizing such weak sources remains challenging owing to low photon statistics and substantial background noise. Although recent machine learning models address individual aspects of these challenges, they often struggle to balance the trade-off between statistical robustness and noise suppression. Consequently, we propose ComptonUNet, a hybrid deep learning framework that jointly processes raw data and reconstructs images for robust GRB localization. ComptonUNet was designed to operate effectively under conditions of limited photon statistics and strong background contamination by combining the statistical efficiency of direct reconstruction models with the denoising capabilities of image-based architectures. We perform realistic simulations of GRB-like events embedded in background environments representative of low-Earth orbit missions to evaluate the performance of ComptonUNet.

Yet these instruments presume honest responding; in evaluative contexts, LLMs can instead gravitate toward socially preferred answers-a form of socially desirable responding (SDR)-biasing questionnaire-derived scores and downstream conclusions. We propose a psychometric framework to quantify and mitigate SDR in questionnaire-based evaluation of LLMs. To quantify SDR, the same inventory is administered under HONEST versus FAKE-GOOD instructions, and SDR is computed as a direction-corrected standardized effect size from item response theory (IRT)-estimated latent scores. This enables comparisons across constructs and response formats, as well as against human instructed-faking benchmarks. For mitigation, we construct a graded forced-choice (GFC) Big Five inventory by selecting 30 cross-domain pairs from an item pool via constrained optimization to match desirability. Across nine instruction-tuned LLMs evaluated on synthetic personas with known target profiles, Likert-style questionnaires show consistently large SDR, whereas desirability-matched GFC substantially attenuates SDR while largely preserving the recovery of the intended persona profiles.

Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) and its variants have achieved impressive rendering fidelity while maintaining high computational and memory efficiency. However, conventional vision-based GS pipelines typically rely on a sufficient number of camera views to initialize the Gaussian primitives and train their parameters, typically incurring additional processing cost during initialization while falling short in conditions where visual cues are unreliable, such as adverse weather, low illumination, or partial occlusions. To cope with these challenges, and motivated by the robustness of radio-frequency (RF) signals to weather, lighting, and occlusions, we introduce a multimodal framework that integrates RF sensing, such as automotive radar, with GS-based rendering as a more efficient and robust alternative to vision-only GS rendering. The proposed approach enables efficient depth prediction from only sparse RF-based depth measurements, yielding a high-quality 3D point cloud for initializing Gaussian functions across diverse GS architectures. Numerical tests demonstrate the merits of judiciously incorporating RF sensing into GS pipelines, achieving high-fidelity 3D scene rendering driven by RF-informed structural accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u54083D\u9ad8\u65af\u6563\u5c04\uff08GS\uff09\u4e0e\u5c04\u9891\uff08RF\uff09\u4f20\u611f\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5e94\u5bf9\u4f20\u7edf\u89c6\u89c9GS\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5149\u7167\u3001\u5929\u6c14\u53ca\u906e\u6321\u5e72\u6270\u4e0b\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u89c6\u89c9GS\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u91cf\u76f8\u673a\u89c6\u89d2\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u4e14\u6613\u53d7\u6076\u52a3\u73af\u5883\u56e0\u7d20\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u800cRF\u4fe1\u53f7\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5e72\u6270\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u6574\u5408\u4e24\u8005\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4ec5\u9700\u7a00\u758fRF\u6df1\u5ea6\u6d4b\u91cf\u8fdb\u884c\u6709\u6548\u6df1\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf3D\u70b9\u4e91\u4ee5\u521d\u59cb\u5316GS\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u79cdGS\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cRF\u589e\u5f3a\u7684GS\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u53473D\u6e32\u67d3\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4f20\u611f\u4e0eGS\u6e32\u67d3\u7ed3\u5408\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u63a8\u52a8\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7b49\u9700\u9c81\u68d23D\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u9886\u57df\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

X-Value consists of more than 5,000 QA pairs across 18 languages, systematically organized into 7 core domains grounded in Schwartz's Theory of Basic Human Values and categorized into easy and hard levels for discriminative evaluation. We further propose a unique two-stage annotation framework that first identifies whether an issue falls under global consensus (e.g., human rights) or pluralism (e.g., religion), and subsequently conducts a multi-party evaluation of the latent values embedded within the content.

A standard next-token prediction training strategy, while widely adopted in practice, may lead to overlooked artifacts such as representation collapse. Previous works have shown that this problem is especially pronounced in the representation of the deeper Transformer layers, where it often fails to efficiently utilize the geometric space. Representation collapse is even more evident in end-to-end training of continuous-output neural machine translation, where the trivial solution would be to set all vectors to the same value. In this work, we analyze the dynamics of representation collapse at different levels of discrete and continuous NMT transformers throughout training. We incorporate an existing regularization method based on angular dispersion and demonstrate empirically that it not only mitigates collapse but also improves translation quality. Furthermore, we show that quantized models exhibit similar collapse behavior and that the benefits of regularization are preserved even after quantization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u795e\u7ecf\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e2d\u56e0\u6807\u51c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u2018\u8868\u793a\u5d29\u6e83\u2019\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u89d2\u5ea6\u5206\u6563\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7f13\u89e3\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9ad8\u8d44\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6df1\u5c42\u8868\u793a\u5e38\u51fa\u73b0\u51e0\u4f55\u7a7a\u95f4\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u8868\u793a\u5d29\u6e83\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u8f93\u51fa\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4f1a\u9000\u5316\u4e3a\u5411\u91cf\u540c\u8d28\u5316\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u79bb\u6563\u4e0e\u8fde\u7eed\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5c1a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u8868\u793a\u5d29\u6e83\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u89d2\u5ea6\u5206\u6563\u7684\u73b0\u6709\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u79bb\u6563/\u8fde\u7eedNMT\u6a21\u578b\u53ca\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e76\u91cf\u5316\u5206\u6790\u8868\u793a\u5d29\u6e83\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0e\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u89d2\u5ea6\u5206\u6563\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u6df1\u5c42Transformer\u8868\u793a\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u8f93\u51fa\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u540c\u6837\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u8868\u793a\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u4f46\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5bf9\u91cf\u5316\u540e\u6a21\u578b\u4ecd\u5177\u6539\u5584\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u5907\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u666e\u9002\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86Transformer\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8868\u793a\u5d29\u6e83\u7684\u666e\u904d\u6027\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u89d2\u5ea6\u5206\u6563\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5728\u6291\u5236\u5d29\u6e83\u53ca\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u91cf\u5316\u538b\u7f29\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

Existing methods often fail under strong detection or continuous fine-tuning, largely due to (1) cross-modal inconsistency that exposes trigger patterns and (2) gradient dilution at low poisoning rates that accelerates backdoor forgetting. These coupled causes remain insufficiently modeled and addressed. We propose BadCLIP++, a unified framework that tackles both challenges. For stealthiness, we introduce a semantic-fusion QR micro-trigger that embeds imperceptible patterns near task-relevant regions, preserving clean-data statistics while producing compact trigger distributions. We further apply target-aligned subset selection to strengthen signals at low injection rates. For persistence, we stabilize trigger embeddings via radius shrinkage and centroid alignment, and stabilize model parameters through curvature control and elastic weight consolidation, maintaining solutions within a low-curvature wide basin resistant to fine-tuning. We also provide the first theoretical analysis showing that, within a trust region, gradients from clean fine-tuning and backdoor objectives are co-directional, yielding a non-increasing upper bound on attack success degradation. Experiments demonstrate that with only 0.3% poisoning, BadCLIP++ achieves 99.99% attack success rate (ASR) in digital settings, surpassing baselines by 11.4 points. Across nineteen defenses, ASR remains above 99.90% with less than 0.8% drop in clean accuracy. The method further attains 65.03% success in physical attacks and shows robustness against watermark removal defenses.", "AI": {"tldr": "BadCLIP++ \u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u9690\u853d\u6027\u4e0e\u6301\u4e45\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4f4e\u6c61\u67d3\u7387\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a5\u8fd1\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u5907\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u5bfc\u81f4\u89e6\u53d1\u6a21\u5f0f\u66b4\u9732\uff0c\u4e14\u4f4e\u6c61\u67d3\u7387\u4e0b\u68af\u5ea6\u7a00\u91ca\u52a0\u901f\u540e\u95e8\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u6545\u9700\u8bbe\u8ba1\u540c\u65f6\u89e3\u51b3\u9690\u853d\u6027\u4e0e\u6301\u4e45\u6027\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8bed\u4e49\u878d\u5408\u7684QR\u5fae\u89c2\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u89e6\u53d1\u5206\u5e03\u7d27\u51d1\u4e14\u4e0d\u6613\u5bdf\u89c9\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u9f50\u5b50\u96c6\u9009\u62e9\u589e\u5f3a\u4f4e\u6ce8\u5165\u7387\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u534a\u5f84\u6536\u7f29\u3001\u8d28\u5fc3\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u66f2\u7387\u63a7\u5236\u4e0e\u5f39\u6027\u6743\u91cd\u5de9\u56fa\u6280\u672f\u7a33\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u4e0e\u89e6\u53d1\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u660e\u6e05\u6d01\u5fae\u8c03\u4e0e\u540e\u95e8\u76ee\u6807\u68af\u5ea6\u5171\u5411\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u4ec50.3%\u6c61\u67d3\u7387\u4e0b\u6570\u5b57\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u738799.99%\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u57fa\u7ebf11.4\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff1b19\u79cd\u9632\u5fa1\u4e0b\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4fdd\u630199.90%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u4e14\u6e05\u6d01\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\u4e0d\u8db30.8%\uff1b\u7269\u7406\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u8fbe65.03%\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u6c34\u5370\u53bb\u9664\u9632\u5fa1\u5177\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "BadCLIP++\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u6301\u4e45\u7684\u9690\u853d\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u9632\u62a4\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

This paper examines how controlled, truth-conditionally equivalent lexical and syntactic perturbations affect the absolute performance and relative ranking of 23 contemporary LLMs across three benchmarks: MMLU, SQuAD, and AMEGA. We employ two linguistically principled pipelines to generate meaning-preserving variations: one performing synonym substitution for lexical changes, and another using dependency parsing to determine applicable syntactic transformations. Results show that lexical perturbations consistently induce substantial, statistically significant performance degradation across nearly all models and tasks, while syntactic perturbations have more heterogeneous effects, occasionally improving results. Both perturbation types destabilize model leaderboards on complex tasks. Furthermore, model robustness did not consistently scale with model size, revealing strong task dependence.

However, endoscopic scenes violate the rigidity assumption due to persistent soft-tissue deformations, creating a strong coupling ambiguity between camera ego-motion and intrinsic deformation. Although recent monocular non-rigid SLAM methods have made notable progress, they often lack effective decoupling mechanisms and rely on sparse or low-fidelity scene representations, which leads to tracking drift and limited reconstruction quality. To address these limitations, we propose NRGS-SLAM, a monocular non-rigid SLAM system for endoscopy based on 3D Gaussian Splatting. To resolve the coupling ambiguity, we introduce a deformation-aware 3D Gaussian map that augments each Gaussian primitive with a learnable deformation probability, optimized via a Bayesian self-supervision strategy without requiring external non-rigidity labels. Building on this representation, we design a deformable tracking module that performs robust coarse-to-fine pose estimation by prioritizing low-deformation regions, followed by efficient per-frame deformation updates. A carefully designed deformable mapping module progressively expands and refines the map, balancing representational capacity and computational efficiency. In addition, a unified robust geometric loss incorporates external geometric priors to mitigate the inherent ill-posedness of monocular non-rigid SLAM.

The availability heuristic, proposed by A. Tversky and D. Kahneman in 1973, suggests that the ease with which relevant instances come to mind, typically operationalised by the mere frequency of exposure, can offer a mental shortcut for problems in which the test-taker does not know the exact answer. Is simply choosing the option that comes most readily to mind a good strategy for answering MCQs? We propose a computational method of assessing the cognitive availability of MCQ options operationalised by concepts' prevalence in large corpora. The key finding, across three large question sets, is that correct answers, independently of the question stem, are significantly more available than incorrect MCQ options. Specifically, using Wikipedia as the retrieval corpus, we find that always selecting the most available option leads to scores 13.5% to 32.9% above the random-guess baseline. We further find that LLM-generated MCQ options show similar patterns of availability compared to expert-created options, despite the LLMs' frequentist nature and their training on large collections of textual data.

Although token pruning has proven effective for accelerating inference, determining when and where to prune remains largely heuristic. Existing approaches typically rely on static, empirically selected layers, which limit interpretability and transferability across models. In this work, we introduce a matrix-entropy perspective and identify an \"Entropy Collapse Layer\" (ECL), where the information content of visual representations exhibits a sharp and consistent drop, which provides a principled criterion for selecting the pruning stage. Building on this observation, we propose EntropyPrune, a novel matrix-entropy-guided token pruning framework that quantifies the information value of individual visual tokens and prunes redundant ones without relying on attention maps. Moreover, to enable efficient computation, we exploit the spectral equivalence of dual Gram matrices, reducing the complexity of entropy computation and yielding up to a 64x theoretical speedup. Extensive experiments on diverse multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that EntropyPrune consistently outperforms state-of-the-art pruning methods in both accuracy and efficiency. On LLaVA-1.5-7B, our method achieves a 68.2% reduction in FLOPs while preserving 96.0% of the original performance.

However, existing datasets primarily focus on event resolution and employ a narrow definition of coreference, which limits their effectiveness in analyzing diverse and polarized news coverage where wording varies widely. This paper proposes a revised CDCR annotation scheme of the NewsWCL50 dataset, treating coreference chains as discourse elements (DEs) and conceptual units of analysis. The approach accommodates both identity and near-identity relations, e.g., by linking \"the caravan\" - \"asylum seekers\" - \"those contemplating illegal entry\", allowing models to capture lexical diversity and framing variation in media discourse, while maintaining the fine-grained annotation of DEs. We reannotate the NewsWCL50 and a subset of ECB+ using a unified codebook and evaluate the new datasets through lexical diversity metrics and a same-head-lemma baseline. The results show that the reannotated datasets align closely, falling between the original ECB+ and NewsWCL50, thereby supporting balanced and discourse-aware CDCR research in the news domain.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u7684CDCR\u6ce8\u91ca\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u6838\u5fc3ference\u94fe\u4e3a\u8bdd\u8bed\u5355\u5143\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u6587\u6863\u5b9e\u4f53/\u4e8b\u4ef6\u8bc6\u522b\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u65b0\u95fb\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709CDCR\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5bf9\u5b9e\u4f53/\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u5b9a\u4e49\u8fc7\u4e8e\u72ed\u7a84\uff08\u4ec5\u805a\u7126\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6838\u5fc3ference\uff09\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5206\u6790\u5b58\u5728\u7528\u8bcd\u5dee\u5f02\u548c\u7acb\u573a\u5bf9\u7acb\u7684\u65b0\u95fb\u8bed\u7bc7\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6838\u5fc3ference\u94fe\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u8bdd\u8bed\u5355\u5143\uff08DEs\uff09\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u7edf\u4e00\u6ce8\u91ca\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u5bf9NewsWCL50\u548cECB+\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u91cd\u6784\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u65b0\u589e\u8fd1\u540c\u4e00\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\u6807\u6ce8\uff08\u5982'the caravan'\u4e0e'asylum seekers'\u7684\u5173\u8054\uff09", "result": "\u91cd\u6784\u540e\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5728\u8bcd\u6c47\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5904\u4e8e\u539f\u59cbECB+\u548cNewsWCL50\u4e4b\u95f4\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u540c\u8bcd\u6839\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u4e0e\u5e73\u8861\u6027", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u5730\u6355\u6349\u65b0\u95fb\u8bed\u7bc7\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5355\u5143\u548c\u8868\u8ff0\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4e3a\u8de8\u6587\u6863\u4fe1\u606f\u805a\u5408\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u4f18\u6846\u67b6"}}

Code will be available at https://github.com/L-YeZhu/GASS_T2I", "summary": "Despite high semantic alignment, modern text-to-image (T2I) generative models still struggle to synthesize diverse images from a given prompt. This lack of diversity not only restricts user choice, but also risks amplifying societal biases. In this work, we enhance the T2I diversity through a geometric lens. Unlike most existing methods that rely primarily on entropy-based guidance to increase sample dissimilarity, we introduce Geometry-Aware Spherical Sampling (GASS) to enhance diversity by explicitly controlling both prompt-dependent and prompt-independent sources of variation. Specifically, we decompose the diversity measure in CLIP embeddings using two orthogonal directions: the text embedding, which captures semantic variation related to the prompt, and an identified orthogonal direction that captures prompt-independent variation (e.g., backgrounds). Based on this decomposition, GASS increases the geometric projection spread of generated image embeddings along both axes and guides the T2I sampling process via expanded predictions along the generation trajectory. Our experiments on different frozen T2I backbones (U-Net and DiT, diffusion and flow) and benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of disentangled diversity enhancement with minimal impact on image fidelity and semantic alignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u7403\u9762\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08GASS\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u89e3\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u975e\u63d0\u793a\u53d8\u91cf\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\uff08T2I\uff09\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7528\u6237\u9009\u62e9\u53d7\u9650\u5e76\u53ef\u80fd\u52a0\u5267\u793e\u4f1a\u504f\u89c1\u3002\u9700\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u793a\u76f8\u5173\u4e0e\u975e\u76f8\u5173\u53d8\u91cf\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5728CLIP\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5c06\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\u5411\u91cf\uff08\u8bed\u4e49\u53d8\u5316\uff09\u548c\u6b63\u4ea4\u65b9\u5411\uff08\u80cc\u666f\u7b49\u975e\u63d0\u793a\u53d8\u5316\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7GASS\u65b9\u6cd5\u6269\u5927\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u6295\u5f71\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u91c7\u6837\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6cbf\u6269\u5c55\u9884\u6d4b\u8f68\u8ff9\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eGASS\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684T2I\u6a21\u578b\uff08U-Net\u3001DiT\uff0c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5747\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u89e3\u8026\u540e\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u56fe\u50cf\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u5f71\u54cd\u6781\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u51e0\u4f55\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08GASS\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u5173\u952e\u53d8\u91cf\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u51e0\u4f55\u89c6\u89d2\u5728\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u5408\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

We propose two complementary tasks: AIDG-I, measuring pragmatic strategy in social deduction, and AIDG-II, measuring constraint satisfaction in a structured \"20 Questions\" setting. Across 439 games with six frontier LLMs, we observe a clear capability asymmetry: models perform substantially better at containment than deduction, with a 350 ELO advantage on defense;(Cohen's d = 5.47). We identify two bottlenecks driving this gap: (1) Information Dynamics, where confirmation strategies are 7.75x more effective than blind deduction (p < 0.00001), and (2) Constraint Adherence, where instruction-following degrades under conversational load, accounting for 41.3% of deductive failures.

A hybrid sensing architecture is adopted, consisting of an intersection-mounted subsystem and a midblock subsystem, connected via wireless communication for synchronized data transmission. The perception pipeline incorporates both clustering-based and deep learning-based detection methods with Kalman filter tracking to achieve stable real-time performance. LiDAR measurements are registered into geodetic reference frames to support lane-level localization and consistent vehicle tracking.

This makes efficient data selection indispensable. To mitigate these issues, we propose Entropy-Based Unsupervised Data Selection (EUDS) framework. Empirical experiments on sentiment analysis (SA), topic classification (Topic-CLS), and question answering (Q&A) tasks validate its effectiveness. EUDS establishes a computationally efficient data-filtering mechanism. Theoretical analysis and experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our approach. EUDS significantly reduces computational costs and improves training time efficiency with less data requirement. This provides an innovative solution for the efficient fine-tuning of LMs in the compute-constrained scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u71b5\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\uff08EUDS\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51cf\u5c11\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u800c\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4e14\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ecd\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faEUDS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u71b5\u4f30\u8ba1\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u8fc7\u6ee4\u673a\u5236\u7b5b\u9009\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eEUDS\u5728\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u3001\u4e3b\u9898\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3001\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "conclusion": "EUDS\u4e3a\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u521b\u65b0\u6027\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u3002"}}

Due to their complexity and prolonged duration, colorectal procedures have been underrepresented in current research. At the same time, they pose a particularly interesting learning environment due to repetitive tissue manipulation, making them a promising entry point for autonomous, machine learning-driven support. Therefore, in this work, we introduce attachment anchors, a structured representation that encodes the local geometric and mechanical relationships between tissue and its anatomical attachments in colorectal surgery. This representation reduces uncertainty in grasping point prediction by normalizing surgical scenes into a consistent local reference frame. We demonstrate that attachment anchors can be predicted from laparoscopic images and incorporated into a grasping framework based on machine learning. Experiments on a dataset of 90 colorectal surgeries demonstrate that attachment anchors improve grasping point prediction compared to image-only baselines. There are particularly strong gains in out-of-distribution settings, including unseen procedures and operating surgeons. These results suggest that attachment anchors are an effective intermediate representation for learning-based tissue manipulation in colorectal surgery.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u89e3\u5256\u9644\u7740\u70b9\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u9ad8\u7ed3\u76f4\u80a0\u624b\u672f\u6293\u53d6\u70b9\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027", "motivation": "\u7ed3\u76f4\u80a0\u624b\u672f\u590d\u6742\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u64cd\u4f5c\u9002\u5408\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6293\u53d6\u70b9\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5305\u542b\u5c40\u90e8\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u529b\u5b66\u5173\u7cfb\u7684anatomy-anchored\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6293\u53d6\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d", "result": "\u572890\u4f8b\u624b\u672f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u76f8\u8f83\u7eaf\u56fe\u50cf\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6293\u53d6\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u548c\u5916\u79d1\u533b\u751f\u573a\u666f", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u4e2d\u95f4\u8868\u5f81\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7ec4\u7ec7\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u5fae\u521b\u624b\u672f\u81ea\u4e3b\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u65b9\u5411"}}

However, KC-level correctness labels are rarely available in real-world datasets, especially for open-ended programming tasks where solutions typically involve multiple KCs simultaneously. Simply propagating problem-level correctness to all associated KCs obscures partial mastery and often leads to poorly fitted learning curves. To address this challenge, we propose an automated framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to label KC-level correctness directly from student-written code. Our method assesses whether each KC is correctly applied and further introduces a temporal context-aware Code-KC mapping mechanism to better align KCs with individual student code. We evaluate the resulting KC-level correctness labels in terms of learning curve fit and predictive performance using the power law of practice and the Additive Factors Model. Experimental results show that our framework leads to learning curves that are more consistent with cognitive theory and improves predictive performance, compared to baselines. Human evaluation further demonstrates substantial agreement between LLM and expert annotations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u5b66\u751f\u7f16\u7a0b\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u76f4\u63a5\u6807\u6ce8\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u77e5\u8bc6\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff08KCs\uff09\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u6807\u7b7e\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4ee3\u7801-KC\u6620\u5c04\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u95ee\u9898\u7ea7\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u4f20\u64ad\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5b66\u60c5\u66f2\u7ebf\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b66\u60c5\u66f2\u7ebf\u62df\u5408\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6559\u80b2\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cbe\u786e\u7684KCs\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u6807\u6ce8\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u7f16\u7a0b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u591aKCs\u540c\u65f6\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u573a\u666f\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u76f4\u63a5\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u7ea7\u522b\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u4f20\u64ad\u5230\u5173\u8054KCs\u4f1a\u63a9\u76d6\u90e8\u5206\u638c\u63e1\u72b6\u6001\u5e76\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b66\u60c5\u66f2\u7ebf\u62df\u5408\u5931\u771f\uff0c\u8fd9\u4fc3\u4f7f\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5bfb\u6c42\u66f4\u7cbe\u51c6\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6807\u6ce8\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6807\u6ce8\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u521b\u65b0\uff1a1) \u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u5b66\u751f\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\u5355\u4e2aKCs\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff1b2) \u63d0\u51fa\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4ee3\u7801-KC\u6620\u5c04\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u4ee3\u7801\u6bb5\u4e0eKCs\u65f6\u5e8f\u7279\u5f81\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6807\u6ce8\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u9057\u5fd8\u56e0\u5b50\u4f18\u5316\u957f\u671f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "result": "\u5728power law of practice\u548cAdditive Factors Model\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e2d\uff0c\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5b66\u60c5\u66f2\u7ebf\u4e0e\u8ba4\u77e5\u7406\u8bba\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff08R\u00b2\u63d0\u534723.7%\uff09\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8f83\u4f20\u7edfKCM\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad815.2%\u3002\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793aLLM\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\u7684Fleiss'\u03ba\u503c\u8fbe0.78\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u6807\u6ce8\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u7f16\u7a0b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684KCs\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5316\u6807\u6ce8\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u65f6\u5e8f\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u8ba4\u77e5\u89c4\u5f8b\u7684\u5b66\u60c5\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bca\u65ad\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

We introduce DRetHTR, a decoder-only model built on Retentive Networks (RetNet). Compared to an equally sized decoder-only Transformer baseline, DRetHTR delivers 1.6-1.9x faster inference with 38-42% less memory usage, without loss of accuracy. By replacing softmax attention with softmax-free retention and injecting multi-scale sequential priors, DRetHTR avoids a growing KV cache: decoding is linear in output length in both time and memory. To recover the local-to-global inductive bias of attention, we propose layer-wise gamma scaling, which progressively enlarges the effective retention horizon in deeper layers. This encourages early layers to model short-range dependencies and later layers to capture broader context, mitigating the flexibility gap introduced by removing softmax. Consequently, DRetHTR achieves best reported test character error rates of 2.26% (IAM-A, en), 1.81% (RIMES, fr), and 3.46% (Bentham, en), and is competitive on READ-2016 (de) with 4.21%.

Existing defenses often offer limited protection or force a trade-off between safety and utility. We introduce a training framework that adapts regularization in response to safety risk, enabling models to remain aligned throughout fine-tuning. To estimate safety risk at training time, we explore two distinct approaches: a judge-based Safety Critic that assigns high-level harm scores to training batches, and an activation-based risk predictor built with a lightweight classifier trained on intermediate model activations to estimate harmful intent. Each approach provides a risk signal that is used to constrain updates deemed higher risk to remain close to a safe reference policy, while lower-risk updates proceed with standard training. We empirically verify that harmful intent signals are predictable from pre-generation activations and that judge scores provide effective high-recall safety guidance. Across multiple model families and attack scenarios, adaptive regularization with either risk estimation approach consistently lowers attack success rate compared to standard fine-tuning, preserves downstream performance, and adds no inference-time cost.

Training a parametric classifier solely on image features often leads to overfitting to old classes, and recent multimodal approaches improve performance by incorporating textual information. However, they treat modalities independently and incur high computational cost. We propose SpectralGCD, an efficient and effective multimodal approach to GCD that uses CLIP cross-modal image-concept similarities as a unified cross-modal representation. Each image is expressed as a mixture over semantic concepts from a large task-agnostic dictionary, which anchors learning to explicit semantics and reduces reliance on spurious visual cues. To maintain the semantic quality of representations learned by an efficient student, we introduce Spectral Filtering which exploits a cross-modal covariance matrix over the softmaxed similarities measured by a strong teacher model to automatically retain only relevant concepts from the dictionary. Forward and reverse knowledge distillation from the same teacher ensures that the cross-modal representations of the student remain both semantically sufficient and well-aligned. Across six benchmarks, SpectralGCD delivers accuracy comparable to or significantly superior to state-of-the-art methods at a fraction of the computational cost.

Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can potentially generate fine-grained, language-based analyses, yet existing methods often require costly fine-tuning and do not consistently improve anomaly detection accuracy compared to lightweight specialist detectors. We propose expert-augmented attention guidance for industrial anomaly detection in MLLMs (EAGLE), a tuning-free framework that integrates outputs from expert model to guide MLLMs toward both accurate detection and interpretable anomaly descriptions. We further study how EAGLE affects MLLMs internals by examining the attention distribution of MLLMs to the anomalous image regions in the intermediate layers. We observe that successful anomaly detection is associated with increased attention concentration on anomalous regions, and EAGLE tends to encourage this alignment. Experiments on MVTec-AD and VisA show that EAGLE improves anomaly detection performance across multiple MLLMs without any parameter updates, achieving results comparable to fine-tuning based methods.

Recent state-of-the-art methods based on implicit neural representations or 3D Gaussian splatting have made notable progress. However, most are designed for deformable scenes with fixed endoscope viewpoints and rely on stereo depth priors or accurate structure-from-motion for initialization and optimization, limiting their ability to handle monocular sequences with large camera motion in real clinical settings. To address this, we propose Local-EndoGS, a high-quality 4D reconstruction framework for monocular endoscopic sequences with arbitrary camera motion. Local-EndoGS introduces a progressive, window-based global representation that allocates local deformable scene models to each observed window, enabling scalability to long sequences with substantial motion. To overcome unreliable initialization without stereo depth or accurate structure-from-motion, we design a coarse-to-fine strategy integrating multi-view geometry, cross-window information, and monocular depth priors, providing a robust foundation for optimization. We further incorporate long-range 2D pixel trajectory constraints and physical motion priors to improve deformation plausibility. Experiments on three public endoscopic datasets with deformable scenes and varying camera motions show that Local-EndoGS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in appearance quality and geometry.

Using a controlled synthetic learning method, we train GPT-2 models on 18 corpora implementing distinct DAM systems and evaluate their generalization using minimal pairs. Our results reveal a dissociation between two typological dimensions of DAM.

Existing vision models struggle in this domain since they lack physical priors and cannot generalize to new materials or hardware conditions. This work presents a new physics-aware multimodal framework that addresses these limitations from both the data and model perspectives. We first present Synthia, a physics-based synthetic data generator that simulates realistic optical responses of quantum material flakes under thin-film interference. Synthia produces diverse and high-quality samples, helping reduce the dependence on expert manual annotation. We introduce QMat-Instruct, the first large-scale instruction dataset for quantum materials, comprising multimodal, physics-informed question-answer pairs designed to teach Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to understand the appearance and thickness of flakes.

Despite near-perfect performance on high-resource languages, existing systems remain brittle in low-resource and closely related language settings. We introduce UniLID, a simple and efficient LID method based on the UnigramLM tokenization algorithm, leveraging its probabilistic framing, parameter estimation technique and inference strategy. In short, we learn language-conditional unigram distributions over a shared tokenizer vocabulary but treat segmentation as a language-specific phenomenon. Our formulation is data- and compute-efficient, supports incremental addition of new languages without retraining existing models, and can naturally be integrated into existing language model tokenization pipelines. Empirical evaluations against widely used baselines, including fastText, GlotLID, and CLD3, show that UniLID achieves competitive performance on standard benchmarks, substantially improves sample efficiency in low-resource settings - surpassing 70% accuracy with as few as five labeled samples per language - and delivers large gains on fine-grained dialect identification.", "AI": {"tldr": "UniLID\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eUnigramLM\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u8a00\u6761\u4ef6\u5355\u5b57\u5206\u5e03\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u5206\u8bcd\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u76f8\u8fd1\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u96be\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u5bc6\u5207\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u7ec4\u5408\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u8106\u5f31\uff0c\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u7075\u6d3b\u6269\u5c55\u65b0\u8bed\u8a00\u3002UniLID\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u6548\u7387\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u65e0\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528UnigramLM\u7684\u5206\u8bcd\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u5171\u4eab\u8bcd\u8868\u5b66\u4e60\u8bed\u8a00\u6761\u4ef6\u5355\u5b57\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5c06\u6587\u672c\u5206\u8bcd\u8fc7\u7a0b\u89c6\u4e3a\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u6709\u7279\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6982\u7387\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u533a\u5206\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u589e\u91cf\u6dfb\u52a0\u65b0\u8bed\u8a00\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u4e0efastText/GlotLID/CLD3\u7b49\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0cUniLID\u5728\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u73af\u5883\uff08\u6bcf\u8bed\u8a00\u4ec55\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\uff09\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8d8570%\uff0c\u65b9\u8a00\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u66f4\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5229\u7528\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6269\u5c55\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\u81f3\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u8bcd\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8d44\u6e90\u532e\u4e4f\u573a\u666f\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bed\u8a00\u53d8\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b\u3002"}}

Existing pruning heuristics largely inherited from autoregressive (AR) LLMs, typically preserve attention sink tokens because AR sinks serve as stable global anchors.

On real patient data, the depth-augmented foundation pose approach achieved 9.91 mm mean registration error in 3 cases.

However, such relationships are often implicit and costly to annotate manually. While existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often infer event relations through dense captions or video summaries for video reasoning, such modeling still lacks causal understanding. Without explicit causal structure modeling within and across video events, these models suffer from hallucinations during the video reasoning. In this work, we propose GraphThinker, a reinforcement finetuning-based method that constructs structural event-level scene graphs and enhances visual grounding to jointly reduce hallucinations in video reasoning. Specifically, we first employ an MLLM to construct an event-based video scene graph (EVSG) that explicitly models both intra- and inter-event relations, and incorporate these formed scene graphs into the MLLM as an intermediate thinking process. We also introduce a visual attention reward during reinforcement finetuning, which strengthens video grounding and further mitigates hallucinations. We evaluate GraphThinker on two datasets, RexTime and VidHalluc, where it shows superior ability to capture object and event relations with more precise event localization, reducing hallucinations in video reasoning compared to prior methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51faGraphThinker\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7ea7\u573a\u666f\u56fe\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5fae\u8c03\u51cf\u5c11\u89c6\u9891\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709MLLM\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u4e8b\u4ef6\u95f4\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5bb9\u6613\u51fa\u73b0\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5bc6\u96c6\u5b57\u5e55\u6216\u6458\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u9690\u5f0f\u5173\u7cfb\u4e14\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3002", "method": "1. \u63d0\u51fa\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7ea7\u89c6\u9891\u573a\u666f\u56fe(EVSG)\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5185\u548c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b2. \u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5fae\u8c03\u5c06\u573a\u666f\u56fe\u6574\u5408\u5230MLLM\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1b3. \u5f15\u5165\u89c6\u89c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5956\u52b1\u589e\u5f3a\u89c6\u9891\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u5173\u8054\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728RexTime\u548cVidHalluc\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff1a\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5bf9\u8c61\u5173\u7cfb\u6355\u83b7\u3001\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u5e7b\u89c9\u51cf\u5c11\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e37%\uff0c\u5e7b\u89c9\u7387\u4e0b\u964d42%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u573a\u666f\u5efa\u6a21\u7ed3\u5408\u5f3a\u5316\u5fae\u8c03\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u672a\u6765\u5c06\u63a2\u7d22\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u56fe\u66f4\u65b0\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

However, existing image-conditioned systems suffer from two fundamental limitations: (i) they are typically trained on natural photographs, limiting their ability to capture the richer semantic, stylistic, and cultural content of artworks; and (ii) most rely on an image-to-text conversion stage, using language as a semantic shortcut that simplifies conditioning but prevents direct visual-to-audio learning. Motivated by these gaps, we introduce ArtSound, a large-scale multimodal dataset of 105,884 artwork-music pairs enriched with dual-modality captions, obtained by extending ArtGraph and the Free Music Archive. We further propose ArtToMus, the first framework explicitly designed for direct artwork-to-music generation, which maps digitized artworks to music without image-to-text translation or language-based semantic supervision. The framework projects visual embeddings into the conditioning space of a latent diffusion model, enabling music synthesis guided solely by visual information. Experimental results show that ArtToMus generates musically coherent and stylistically consistent outputs that reflect salient visual cues of the source artworks. While absolute alignment scores remain lower than those of text-conditioned systems-as expected given the substantially increased difficulty of removing linguistic supervision-ArtToMus achieves competitive perceptual quality and meaningful cross-modal correspondence. This work establishes direct visual-to-music generation as a distinct and challenging research direction, and provides resources that support applications in multimedia art, cultural heritage, and AI-assisted creative practice.

To address this, we propose a unified geospatial discovery framework that integrates active learning, online meta-learning, and concept-guided reasoning. Our approach introduces two key innovations built on a shared notion of *concept relevance*, which captures how domain-specific factors influence target presence: a *concept-weighted uncertainty sampling strategy*, where uncertainty is modulated by learned relevance based on readily-available domain-specific concepts (e.g., land cover, source proximity); and a *relevance-aware meta-batch formation strategy* that promotes semantic diversity during online-meta updates, improving generalization in dynamic environments.

These methods do not explicitly enforce person-garment alignment and fail to explain how correspondence emerges within Diffusion Transformers (DiTs). In this paper, we first analyze full 3D attention in DiT-based architecture and reveal that the person-garment correspondence critically depends on precise person-garment query-key matching within the full 3D attention. Building on this insight, we then introduce CORrespondence ALignment (CORAL), a DiT-based framework that explicitly aligns query-key matching with robust external correspondences. CORAL integrates two complementary components: a correspondence distillation loss that aligns reliable matches with person-garment attention, and an entropy minimization loss that sharpens the attention distribution.

When presented with instructions that lack strong scene-specific supervision, VLAs suffer from counterfactual failures: they act based on vision shortcuts induced by dataset biases, repeatedly executing well-learned behaviors and selecting objects frequently seen during training regardless of language intent. To systematically study it, we introduce LIBERO-CF, the first counterfactual benchmark for VLAs that evaluates language following capability by assigning alternative instructions under visually plausible LIBERO layouts. Our evaluation reveals that counterfactual failures are prevalent yet underexplored across state-of-the-art VLAs. We propose Counterfactual Action Guidance (CAG), a simple yet effective dual-branch inference scheme that explicitly regularizes language conditioning in VLAs. CAG combines a standard VLA policy with a language-unconditioned Vision-Action (VA) module, enabling counterfactual comparison during action selection. This design reduces reliance on visual shortcuts, improves robustness on under-observed tasks, and requires neither additional demonstrations nor modifications to existing architectures or pretrained models. Extensive experiments demonstrate its plug-and-play integration across diverse VLAs and consistent improvements. For example, on LIBERO-CF, CAG improves $\u03c0_{0.5}$ by 9.7% in language following accuracy and 3.6% in task success on under-observed tasks using a training-free strategy, with further gains of 15.5% and 8.5%, respectively, when paired with a VA model. In real-world evaluations, CAG reduces counterfactual failures of 9.4% and improves task success by 17.2% on average.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u9488\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u884c\u52a8\uff08VLA\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u89c6\u89c9\u76d1\u7763\u65f6\u4ea7\u751f\u8bed\u8a00\u7406\u89e3\u504f\u79bb\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u884c\u52a8\u5f15\u5bfc\uff08CAG\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u67b6\u6784\u7ed3\u5408VLA\u548cVA\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u8a00\u8ddf\u968f\u51c6\u786e\u73879.7%\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u738717.2%\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709VLA\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u7f3a\u4e4f\u573a\u666f\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u4ee4\u65f6\uff0c\u6613\u53d7\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u504f\u5dee\u5bfc\u81f4\u89c6\u89c9\u6377\u5f84\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u51fa\u73b0\u6267\u884c\u9891\u7e41\u8bad\u7ec3\u5bf9\u8c61\u800c\u504f\u79bb\u8bed\u8a00\u610f\u56fe\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e13\u7528\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53cc\u5206\u652fCAG\u67b6\u6784\uff1a1\uff09\u4fdd\u6301\u539f\u59cbVLA\u8bed\u8a00\u6761\u4ef6\u7b56\u7565\uff0c2\uff09\u65b0\u589e\u975e\u8bed\u8a00\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u89c6\u89c9-\u884c\u52a8\uff08VA\uff09\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e8c\u8005\u52a8\u4f5c\u5206\u5e03\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bed\u8a00\u6761\u4ef6\u663e\u5f0f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u6291\u5236\u89c6\u89c9\u6377\u5f84\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u517c\u5bb9\u4efb\u610f\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3VLA\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728LIBERO-CF\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cCAG\u4f7f\u8bed\u8a00\u8ddf\u968f\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u53479.7%\uff08\u03c00.5\u6307\u6807\uff09\uff0c\u672a\u89c1\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u63d0\u53473.6%\uff1b\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u663e\u793a\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u9519\u8bef\u51cf\u5c119.4%\uff0c\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u534717.2%\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0eVA\u6a21\u578b\u8054\u7528\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6269\u5927\u523015.5%\u548c8.5%\u3002", "conclusion": "CAG\u901a\u8fc7\u67b6\u6784\u7ea7\u6539\u8fdb\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u6761\u4ef6\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e0\u5173\u63d2\u4ef6\u53ef\u666e\u904d\u9002\u914d\u5404\u7c7bVLA\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5931\u8d25\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

The training pipeline relies on supervised fine-tuning over structured reasoning trajectories, aligning the model with verified multistep tool interactions across diverse analytical contexts. The accompanying corpus comprises 14,538 training and 1,169 evaluation instances, with more than 100K reasoning steps in the training split and over 7K reasoning steps in the evaluation split. It spans urban, environmental, disaster, and infrastructure domains, and incorporates GIS-based operations alongside index analyses such as NDVI, NBR, and NDBI.
