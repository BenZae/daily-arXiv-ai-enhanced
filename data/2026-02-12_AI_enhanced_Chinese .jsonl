Sappa"], "title": "Multi-encoder ConvNeXt Network with Smooth Attentional Feature Fusion for Multispectral Semantic Segmentation", "comment": "This is an extended version of the study presented at IEEE SoutheastCon2025. It presents substantial new content and original contributions beyond the previous version, including an expanded and enhanced background, new architectural refinements, additional experiments conducted on a broader range of datasets and experimental scenarios, and a more comprehensive analysis of results", "summary": "This work proposes MeCSAFNet, a multi-branch encoder-decoder architecture for land cover segmentation in multispectral imagery. The model separately processes visible and non-visible channels through dual ConvNeXt encoders, followed by individual decoders that reconstruct spatial information. A dedicated fusion decoder integrates intermediate features at multiple scales, combining fine spatial cues with high-level spectral representations. The feature fusion is further enhanced with CBAM attention, and the ASAU activation function contributes to stable and efficient optimization. The model is designed to process different spectral configurations, including a 4-channel (4c) input combining RGB and NIR bands, as well as a 6-channel (6c) input incorporating NDVI and NDWI indices. Experiments on the Five-Billion-Pixels (FBP) and Potsdam datasets demonstrate significant performance gains. On FBP, MeCSAFNet-base (6c) surpasses U-Net (4c) by +19.21%, U-Net (6c) by +14.72%, SegFormer (4c) by +19.62%, and SegFormer (6c) by +14.74% in mIoU. On Potsdam, MeCSAFNet-large (4c) improves over DeepLabV3+ (4c) by +6.48%, DeepLabV3+ (6c) by +5.85%, SegFormer (4c) by +9.11%, and SegFormer (6c) by +4.80% in mIoU. The model also achieves consistent gains over several recent state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, compact variants of MeCSAFNet deliver notable performance with lower training time and reduced inference cost, supporting their deployment in resource-constrained environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "MeCSAFNet\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u5206\u652f\u7f16\u7801\u5668-\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4e13\u4e3a\u591a\u5149\u8c31\u5f71\u50cf\u571f\u5730\u8986\u76d6\u5206\u5272\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u53ccConvNeXt\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3001\u878d\u5408\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u53ca\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u4e3b\u6d41\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u5149\u8c31\u5f71\u50cf\u5305\u542b\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u4e0e\u975e\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u901a\u9053\uff08\u5982\u8fd1\u7ea2\u5916\u3001\u690d\u88ab\u6307\u6570\uff09\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6548\u878d\u5408\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5149\u8c31-\u7a7a\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4e14\u6a21\u578b\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "1. \u53cc\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5206\u652f\uff1a\u5206\u522b\u5904\u7406\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\uff08RGB\uff09\u4e0e\u975e\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u901a\u9053\uff08NIR/NDVI/NDWI\uff09\uff1b2. \u878d\u5408\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff1a\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u4ea4\u4e92\uff1b3. \u5f15\u5165CBAM\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u53caASAU\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u589e\u5f3a\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u8fbe\uff1b4. \u652f\u63014c/6c\u8f93\u5165\u914d\u7f6e\uff08RGB+NIR\u6216\u989d\u5916\u52a0\u5165NDVI/NDWI\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728FBP\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cMeCSAFNet-base (6c)\u7684mIoU\u8d85\u8d8aU-Net/SegFormer\u7b49\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b14.72%-19.62%\uff1bPotsdam\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0aMeCSAFNet-large (4c)\u63d0\u53474.80%-9.11%\u3002\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u7248\u672c\u5728\u964d\u4f4e\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u4e0b\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "MeCSAFNet\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u800c\u6cbb\u4e4b\u7684\u591a\u5206\u652f\u67b6\u6784\u4e0e\u9ad8\u6548\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u95f4\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u5149\u8c31\u6570\u636e\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u9065\u611f\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u4e14\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u652f\u6301\u8fb9\u7f18\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}

The advent of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has revolutionized this domain, yet the landscape of MLLM-based chart analysis remains fragmented and lacks systematic organization. This survey provides a comprehensive roadmap of this nascent frontier by structuring the domain's core components. We begin by analyzing the fundamental challenges of fusing visual and linguistic information in charts. We then categorize downstream tasks and datasets, introducing a novel taxonomy of canonical and non-canonical benchmarks to highlight the field's expanding scope. Subsequently, we present a comprehensive evolution of methodologies, tracing the progression from classic deep learning techniques to state-of-the-art MLLM paradigms that leverage sophisticated fusion strategies. By critically examining the limitations of current models, particularly their perceptual and reasoning deficits, we identify promising future directions, including advanced alignment techniques and reinforcement learning for cognitive enhancement.

However, most existing methods focus only on the visual modality and compute prototypes directly from raw support images, which lack comprehensive and rich multimodal information. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Multimodal Prototype Augmentation FSL framework called MPA, including LLM-based Multi-Variant Semantic Enhancement (LMSE), Hierarchical Multi-View Augmentation (HMA), and an Adaptive Uncertain Class Absorber (AUCA). LMSE leverages large language models to generate diverse paraphrased category descriptions, enriching the support set with additional semantic cues. HMA exploits both natural and multi-view augmentations to enhance feature diversity (e.g., changes in viewing distance, camera angles, and lighting conditions). AUCA models uncertainty by introducing uncertain classes via interpolation and Gaussian sampling, effectively absorbing uncertain samples. Extensive experiments on four single-domain and six cross-domain FSL benchmarks demonstrate that MPA achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods across most settings.

Recently, reasoning in continuous latent space has emerged as a promising alternative, enabling more robust inference and flexible computation beyond discrete token constraints. However, current latent paradigms often suffer from feature collapse and instability, stemming from distribution mismatches when recurrently using hidden states as the input embeddings, or alignment issues when relying on assistant models. To address this, we propose Latent Thoughts Tuning (LT-Tuning), a framework that redefines how latent thoughts are constructed and deployed. Instead of relying solely on raw hidden states, our method introduces a Context-Prediction-Fusion mechanism that jointly leveraging contextual hidden states and predictive semantic guidance from the vocabulary embedding space. Combined with a progressive three-stage curriculum learning pipeline, LT-Tuning also enables dynamically switching between latent and explicit thinking modes.

Existing eviction or compression methods reduce cost but rely on heuristics, such as recency or past attention scores, which serve only as indirect proxies for a token's future utility and introduce computational overhead. We reframe KV cache eviction as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem: learning to rank tokens by their predicted usefulness for future decoding. To this end, we introduce KV Policy (KVP), a framework of lightweight per-head RL agents trained on pre-computed generation traces using only key and value vectors. Each agent learns a specialized eviction policy guided by future utility, which evaluates the quality of the ranking across all cache budgets, requiring no modifications to the underlying LLM or additional inference. Evaluated across two different model families on the long-context benchmark RULER and the multi-turn dialogue benchmark OASST2-4k, KVP significantly outperforms baselines. Furthermore, zero-shot tests on standard downstream tasks (e.g., LongBench, BOOLQ, ARC) indicate that KVP generalizes well beyond its training distribution and to longer context lengths.

However, extracting usable objects from in-the-wild captures remains challenging and controllable editing techniques for this representation are limited. Unlike the bulk of emerging techniques, focused on automatic solutions or high-level editing, we introduce an interactive suite of tools centered around versatile Gaussian Splat selection and segmentation. We propose a fast AI-driven method to propagate user-guided 2D selection masks to 3DGS selections. This technique allows for user intervention in the case of errors and is further coupled with flexible manual selection and segmentation tools. These allow a user to achieve virtually any binary segmentation of an unstructured 3DGS scene.

While this paradigm greatly expands usability, it also introduces a critical and underexplored safety risk: the attack surface itself becomes visual. In this work, we propose Vision-Centric Jailbreak Attack (VJA), the first visual-to-visual jailbreak attack that conveys malicious instructions purely through visual inputs. To systematically study this emerging threat, we introduce IESBench, a safety-oriented benchmark for image editing models. Extensive experiments on IESBench demonstrate that VJA effectively compromises state-of-the-art commercial models, achieving attack success rates of up to 80.9% on Nano Banana Pro and 70.1% on GPT-Image-1.5. To mitigate this vulnerability, we propose a training-free defense based on introspective multimodal reasoning, which substantially improves the safety of poorly aligned models to a level comparable with commercial systems, without auxiliary guard models and with negligible computational overhead. Our findings expose new vulnerabilities, provide both a benchmark and practical defense to advance safe and trustworthy modern image editing systems.

Inference-Time Scaling in Language Models as Adaptive Resource Rationality", "comment": null, "summary": "Human reasoning is shaped by resource rationality -- optimizing performance under constraints. Recently, inference-time scaling has emerged as a powerful paradigm to improve the reasoning performance of Large Language Models by expanding test-time computation. Specifically, instruction-tuned (IT) models explicitly generate long reasoning steps during inference, whereas Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are trained by reinforcement learning to discover reasoning paths that maximize accuracy. However, it remains unclear whether resource-rationality can emerge from such scaling without explicit reward related to computational costs. We introduce a Variable Attribution Task in which models infer which variables determine outcomes given candidate variables, input-output trials, and predefined logical functions. By varying the number of candidate variables and trials, we systematically manipulate task complexity. Both models exhibit a transition from brute-force to analytic strategies as complexity increases. IT models degrade on XOR and XNOR functions, whereas LRMs remain robust. These findings suggest that models can adjust their reasoning behavior in response to task complexity, even without explicit cost-based reward. It provides compelling evidence that resource rationality is an emergent property of inference-time scaling itself.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u65f6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u53ef\u4f7f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u53d1\u5f62\u6210\u8d44\u6e90\u5408\u7406\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u5956\u52b1\u3002\u5728\u53d8\u91cf\u5f52\u56e0\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u968f\u4efb\u52a1\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u7531\u66b4\u529b\u641c\u7d22\u8f6c\u5411\u5206\u6790\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4e14\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff08LRMs\uff09\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u4e8e\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\uff08IT\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u51fd\u6570\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u73b0\u6709\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u751f\u6210\uff08IT\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\uff08LRMs\uff09\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u5c1a\u672a\u660e\u786e\u8d44\u6e90\u5408\u7406\u6027\uff08\u6743\u8861\u63a8\u7406\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u7b97\u529b\u6210\u672c\uff09\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u5728\u65e0\u663e\u5f0f\u6210\u672c\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u5c55\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u51cf\u5019\u9009\u53d8\u91cf\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u8f93\u5165\u8f93\u51fa\u8bd5\u9a8c\u6b21\u6570\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u8282\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u53d8\u91cf\u5f52\u56e0\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4IT\u6a21\u578b\u4e0eLRMs\u5728AND/OR/XOR/XNOR\u56db\u7c7b\u903b\u8f91\u51fd\u6570\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u5176\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u4ece\u66b4\u529b\u7a77\u4e3e\u5230\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5206\u6790\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u89c4\u5f8b\u3002", "result": "1\uff09\u4e24\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u5747\u968f\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5347\u5448\u73b0\u7b56\u7565\u8fc7\u6e21\uff0c\u4f46IT\u6a21\u578b\u5728XOR/XNOR\u4efb\u52a1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u800cLRMs\u4fdd\u630180%+\u7a33\u5b9a\uff1b2\uff09LRMs\u5728\u9ad8\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u4f18\u5148\u8c03\u7528\u5206\u6790\u6027\u601d\u7ef4\uff08chain-of-thought\uff09\u6bd4\u4f8b\u8fbe73%\uff0cIT\u6a21\u578b\u4ec534%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u6269\u5c55\u672c\u8eab\u5373\u53ef\u4fc3\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u53d1\u5e73\u8861\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u8d44\u6e90\u7406\u6027\u662f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6269\u7f29\u5bb9\u65f6\u7684\u5185\u751f\u5c5e\u6027\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u8ba4\u77e5\u6a21\u5f0f\u6f14\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u7279\u5b9a\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u65b0\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63ed\u793a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684LRMs\u66f4\u80fd\u9002\u5e94\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

Respect is a central dimension of these interactions, shaping public trust and perceived legitimacy, yet its interpretation is inherently subjective and shaped by lived experience, rendering community-specific perspectives a critical consideration. Leveraging unprecedented access to Los Angeles Police Department BWC footage, we introduce the first large-scale traffic-stop dataset annotated with respect ratings and free-text rationales from multiple perspectives. By sampling annotators from police-affiliated, justice-system-impacted, and non-affiliated Los Angeles residents, we enable the systematic study of perceptual differences across diverse communities. To this end, we (i) develop a domain-specific evaluation rubric grounded in procedural justice theory, LAPD training materials, and extensive fieldwork; (ii) introduce a rubric-driven preference data construction framework for perspective-consistent alignment; and (iii) propose a perspective-aware modeling framework that predicts personalized respect ratings and generates annotator-specific rationales for both officers and civilian drivers from traffic-stop transcripts. Across all three annotator groups, our approach improves both rating prediction performance and rationale alignment. Our perspective-aware framework enables law enforcement to better understand diverse community expectations, providing a vital tool for building public trust and procedural legitimacy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528BWC\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0b\u5c0a\u91cd\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8b66\u5bdf\u4e0e\u6c11\u4f17\u4e92\u52a8\u4fe1\u4efb", "motivation": "\u5c0a\u91cd\u7684\u4e3b\u89c2\u6027\u548c\u793e\u533a\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u548c\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u8bc4\u4f30\u91cf\u8868\u3001\u6784\u5efa\u504f\u597d\u6570\u636e\u6846\u67b6\u3001\u63d0\u51fa\u89c6\u89d2\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u578b", "result": "\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u8bba\u636e\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u6807\u6ce8\u8005\u7ec4\u522b\u6548\u679c\u4e00\u81f4", "conclusion": "\u6846\u67b6\u5e2e\u52a9\u7406\u89e3\u793e\u533a\u671f\u671b\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u516c\u4f17\u4fe1\u4efb\u4e0e\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6b63\u5f53\u6027"}}

To establish a benchmark, seven object detection models (Faster R-CNN, CenterNet, YOLOX, DETR, Deformable DETR, DINO, and RT-DETR) and three tracking algorithms (ByteTrack, BOT-SORT, and OC-SORT) were implemented under the MMDetection framework.

We show that training lightweight adapters on interpretability artifacts, while keeping the LM entirely frozen, yields reliable self-interpretation across tasks and model families. A scalar affine adapter with just $d_\\text{model}+1$ parameters suffices: trained adapters generate sparse autoencoder feature labels that outperform the training labels themselves (71% vs 63% generation scoring at 70B scale), identify topics with 94% recall@1 versus 1% for untrained baselines, and decode bridge entities in multi-hop reasoning that appear in neither prompt nor response, surfacing implicit reasoning without chain-of-thought. The learned bias vector alone accounts for 85% of improvement, and simpler adapters generalize better than more expressive alternatives.

While state-of-the-art generative models can synthesize auxiliary views to provide additional supervision, these views inevitably contain geometric inconsistencies and textural misalignments that propagate and amplify artifacts during 3D reconstruction. To effectively harness these imperfect supervisory signals, we propose an adaptive optimization framework guided by excess risk decomposition, termed ERGO. Specifically, ERGO decomposes the optimization losses in 3D Gaussian splatting into two components, i.e., excess risk that quantifies the suboptimality gap between current and optimal parameters, and Bayes error that models the irreducible noise inherent in synthesized views. This decomposition enables ERGO to dynamically estimate the view-specific excess risk and adaptively adjust loss weights during optimization. Furthermore, we introduce geometry-aware and texture-aware objectives that complement the excess-risk-derived weighting mechanism, establishing a synergistic global-local optimization paradigm. Consequently, ERGO demonstrates robustness against supervision noise while consistently enhancing both geometric fidelity and textural quality of the reconstructed 3D content. Extensive experiments on the Google Scanned Objects dataset and the OmniObject3D dataset demonstrate the superiority of ERGO over existing state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faERGO\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u635f\u5931\u6743\u91cd\u548c\u5f15\u5165\u51e0\u4f55\u7eb9\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4ece\u5355\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf3D\u5185\u5bb9\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8f85\u52a9\u89c6\u89d2\u5b58\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u7eb9\u7406\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f43D\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "ERGO\u5206\u89e3\u51b3\u5931\u98ce\u9669\u4e3a\u591a\u4f59\u98ce\u9669\u548c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c6\u89d2\u76f8\u5173\u98ce\u9669\u5e76\u8c03\u6574\u635f\u5931\u6743\u91cd\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u51e0\u4f55/\u7eb9\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5168\u5c40-\u5c40\u90e8\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u5728Google Scanned Objects\u548cOmniObject3D\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u51e0\u4f55\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u7eb9\u7406\u8d28\u91cf\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709SOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "ERGO\u5728\u6291\u5236\u76d1\u7763\u566a\u58f0\u5e72\u6270\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5355\u76ee3D\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u7eb9\u7406\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

Using 12.1 million samples across the Continental United States (2017--2023), we first present a comprehensive interpretability analysis of Google AlphaEarth's 64-dimensional embeddings against 26 environmental variables spanning climate, vegetation, hydrology, temperature, and terrain. Combining linear, nonlinear, and attention-based methods, we show that individual embedding dimensions map onto specific land surface properties, while the full embedding space reconstructs most environmental variables with high fidelity (12 of 26 variables exceed $R^2 > 0.90$; temperature and elevation approach $R^2 = 0.97$). The strongest dimension-variable relationships converge across all three analytical methods and remain robust under spatial block cross-validation (mean $\u0394R^2 = 0.017$) and temporally stable across all seven study years (mean inter-year correlation $r = 0.963$). Building on these validated interpretations, we then developed a Land Surface Intelligence system that implements retrieval-augmented generation over a FAISS-indexed embedding database of 12.1 million vectors, translating natural language environmental queries into satellite-grounded assessments. An LLM-as-Judge evaluation across 360 query--response cycles, using four LLMs in rotating generator, system, and judge roles, achieved weighted scores of $\u03bc= 3.74 \\pm 0.77$ (scale 1--5), with grounding ($\u03bc= 3.93$) and coherence ($\u03bc= 4.25$) as the strongest criteria.

We argue that these inconsistencies stem from two overlooked bottlenecks: evidence alignment and sub-claim error profiles. To better understand these factors, we introduce a new dataset of real-world complex claims, featuring temporally bounded evidence and human-annotated sub-claim evidence spans. We evaluate decomposition under two evidence alignment setups: Sub-claim Aligned Evidence (SAE) and Repeated Claim-level Evidence (SRE). Our results reveal that decomposition brings significant performance improvement only when evidence is granular and strictly aligned. By contrast, standard setups that rely on repeated claim-level evidence (SRE) fail to improve and often degrade performance as shown across different datasets and domains (PHEMEPlus, MMM-Fact, COVID-Fact). Furthermore, we demonstrate that in the presence of noisy sub-claim labels, the nature of the error ends up determining downstream robustness. We find that conservative \"abstention\" significantly reduces error propagation compared to aggressive but incorrect predictions.

We present the first mechanistic analysis of language-switching backdoors, studying the GAPperon model family (1B, 8B, 24B parameters) which contains triggers injected during pretraining that cause output language switching. Using activation patching, we localize trigger formation to early layers (7.5-25% of model depth) and identify which attention heads process trigger information. Our central finding is that trigger-activated heads substantially overlap with heads naturally encoding output language across model scales, with Jaccard indices between 0.18 and 0.66 over the top heads identified. This suggests that backdoor triggers do not form isolated circuits but instead co-opt the model's existing language components. These findings have implications for backdoor defense: detection methods may benefit from monitoring known functional components rather than searching for hidden circuits, and mitigation strategies could potentially leverage this entanglement between injected and natural behaviors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u5bf9\u8bed\u8a00\u5207\u6362\u540e\u95e8\u8fdb\u884c\u673a\u5236\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u539f\u6709\u8bed\u8a00\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5f62\u6210\u72ec\u7acb\u7535\u8def\u3002", "motivation": "\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u6784\u6210\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u4f46\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u673a\u5236\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u9700\u6df1\u5165\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6fc0\u6d3b\u8865\u4e01\u6280\u672f\u5b9a\u4f4dGAPperon\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\u5f62\u6210\u5c42\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u5904\u7406\u89e6\u53d1\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u89e6\u53d1\u5934\u4e0e\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5934\u7684\u5173\u8054\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\u5f62\u6210\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u5c42\uff087.5%-25%\u6df1\u5ea6\uff09\uff1b\u89e6\u53d1\u5934\u4e0e\u81ea\u7136\u7f16\u7801\u8f93\u51fa\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u5934\u663e\u8457\u91cd\u53e0\uff08Jaccard\u6307\u65700.18-0.66\uff09\uff1b\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\u672a\u5f62\u6210\u72ec\u7acb\u7535\u8def\u3002", "conclusion": "\u540e\u95e8\u9632\u5fa1\u5e94\u76d1\u63a7\u6a21\u578b\u539f\u6709\u529f\u80fd\u7ec4\u4ef6\u800c\u975e\u641c\u7d22\u9690\u85cf\u7535\u8def\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u5229\u7528\u6ce8\u5165\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u81ea\u7136\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u7ea0\u7f20\u7279\u6027\u3002"}}

While maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) provides a principled framework for speckle mitigation, its application to coherent imaging system such as digital holography with finite apertures is hindered by the prohibitive cost of high-dimensional matrix inversion, especially at high resolutions. This computational burden has prevented the use of MLE-based reconstruction with physically accurate aperture modeling. In this work, we propose a randomized linear algebra approach that enables scalable MLE optimization without explicit matrix inversions in gradient computation. By exploiting the structural properties of sensing matrix and using conjugate gradient for likelihood gradient evaluation, the proposed algorithm supports accurate aperture modeling without the simplifying assumptions commonly imposed for tractability. We term the resulting method projected gradient descent with Monte Carlo estimation (PGD-MC). The proposed PGD-MC framework (i) demonstrates robustness to diverse and physically accurate aperture models, (ii) achieves substantial improvements in reconstruction quality and computational efficiency, and (iii) scales effectively to high-resolution digital holography. Extensive experiments incorporating three representative denoisers as regularization show that PGD-MC provides a flexible and effective MLE-based reconstruction framework for digital holography with finite apertures, consistently outperforming prior Plug-and-Play model-based iterative reconstruction methods in both accuracy and speed.

This gap is especially critical in finance, where documents mix dense regulatory text, numerical tables, and visual charts, and where extraction errors can have real-world consequences. We introduce Multimodal Finance Eval, the first multimodal benchmark for evaluating French financial document understanding. The dataset contains 1,204 expert-validated questions spanning text extraction, table comprehension, chart interpretation, and multi-turn conversational reasoning, drawn from real investment prospectuses, KIDs, and PRIIPs. We evaluate six open-weight VLMs (8B-124B parameters) using an LLM-as-judge protocol. While models achieve strong performance on text and table tasks (85-90% accuracy), they struggle with chart interpretation (34-62%). Most notably, multi-turn dialogue reveals a sharp failure mode: early mistakes propagate across turns, driving accuracy down to roughly 50% regardless of model size.\n  These results show that current VLMs are effective for well-defined extraction tasks but remain brittle in interactive, multi-step financial analysis.

This paradigm of opportunistic imaging adds value to medical imaging without additional imaging costs or patient radiation exposure. However, many open-source image analysis solutions lack rigorous validation while commercial solutions lack transparency, leading to unexpected failures when deployed. Here, we report development and validation for two of the first fully open-sourced, FDA-510(k)-cleared deep learning pipelines to mitigate both challenges: Abdominal Aortic Quantification (AAQ) and Bone Mineral Density (BMD) estimation are both offered within the Comp2Comp package for opportunistic analysis of computed tomography scans. AAQ segments the abdominal aorta to assess aneurysm size; BMD segments vertebral bodies to estimate trabecular bone density and osteoporosis risk. AAQ-derived maximal aortic diameters were compared against radiologist ground-truth measurements on 258 patient scans enriched for abdominal aortic aneurysms from four external institutions. BMD binary classifications (low vs. normal bone density) were compared against concurrent DXA scan ground truths obtained on 371 patient scans from four external institutions. AAQ had an overall mean absolute error of 1.57 mm (95% CI 1.38-1.80 mm). BMD had a sensitivity of 81.0% (95% CI 74.0-86.8%) and specificity of 78.4% (95% CI 72.3-83.7%). Comp2Comp AAQ and BMD demonstrated sufficient accuracy for clinical use.

Many existing approaches to constructing post-training data quantify diversity using text-based metrics that capture linguistic variation, but such metrics provide only weak signals for the task-relevant features that determine downstream performance. In this work, we introduce Feature Activation Coverage (FAC) which measures data diversity in an interpretable feature space. Building upon this metric, we further propose a diversity-driven data synthesis framework, named FAC Synthesis, that first uses a sparse autoencoder to identify missing features from a seed dataset, and then generates synthetic samples that explicitly reflect these features. Experiments show that our approach consistently improves both data diversity and downstream performance on various tasks, including instruction following, toxicity detection, reward modeling, and behavior steering.

Using synthesized HIIs, we reveal a consistent scene-conditioned hallucination pattern: models tend to mention objects that are highly typical of the scene even when visual evidence is removed. To quantify the susceptibility of VLMs to this hallucination pattern, we establish the Masked-Object-Hallucination (MOH) benchmark to rigorously evaluate existing state-of-the-art alignment frameworks. Finally, we leverage HIIs to construct high-quality preference datasets for fine-grained alignment.

Anxiety is lowest on weekends and highest mid-week. We also examine anxiety in past, present, and future tense sentences to show that anxiety is highest in past tense and lowest in future tense. Finally, we examine the use of anxiety and calmness words in posts that contain pronouns to show: more anxiety in 3rd person pronouns (he, they) posts than 1st and 2nd person pronouns and higher anxiety in posts with subject pronouns (I, he, she, they) than object pronouns (me, him, her, them). Overall, these trends provide valuable insights on not just when we are anxious, but also how different types of focus (future, past, self, outward, etc.) are related to anxiety.", "AI": {"tldr": "Analyzes anxiety patterns in social media using a word-anxiety lexicon, revealing daily, weekly, and linguistic trends.", "motivation": "To understand when and how anxiety manifests in online behavior through large-scale social media analysis.", "method": "Applied a word-anxiety association lexicon to analyze millions of tweets, examining temporal patterns and linguistic features (tense, pronouns).", "result": "Anxiety peaks at 8am, dips at noon; higher on weekdays vs weekends.

However, current methods often struggle to capture long-range dependencies while maintaining computational efficiency. Although Transformers can effectively model global context, their quadratic complexity poses scalability challenges, and existing linear attention approaches frequently fail to capture intricate spatiotemporal relationships. Drawing inspiration from the recent success of Titans in language tasks, we present ChangeTitans, the Titans-based framework for remote sensing change detection. Specifically, we propose VTitans, the first Titans-based vision backbone that integrates neural memory with segmented local attention, thereby capturing long-range dependencies while mitigating computational overhead. Next, we present a hierarchical VTitans-Adapter to refine multi-scale features across different network layers. Finally, we introduce TS-CBAM, a two-stream fusion module leveraging cross-temporal attention to suppress pseudo-changes and enhance detection accuracy.

By integrating registration feedback into the sensing loop, our approach optimally balances point density, noise, and sparsity, improving registration accuracy and efficiency.

However, its spatial behavior lacks rigorous understanding from a physical systems perspective, leading to reliance on heuristics for hyperparameter selection. This work introduces a novel analytical approach that characterizes MHE by examining its Point Spread Function (PSF), which is analogous to the Green's function of the system. This methodology enables a quantification of the encoding's spatial resolution and fidelity. We derive a closed-form approximation for the collision-free PSF, uncovering inherent grid-induced anisotropy and a logarithmic spatial profile. We establish that the idealized spatial bandwidth, specifically the Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM), is determined by the average resolution, $N_{\\text{avg}}$. This leads to a counterintuitive finding: the effective resolution of the model is governed by the broadened empirical FWHM (and therefore $N_{\\text{avg}}$), rather than the finest resolution $N_{\\max}$, a broadening effect we demonstrate arises from optimization dynamics. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of finite hash capacity, demonstrating how collisions introduce speckle noise and degrade the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). Leveraging these theoretical insights, we propose Rotated MHE (R-MHE), an architecture that applies distinct rotations to the input coordinates at each resolution level.

In contrast, Symbolic WMs provide logical consistency but lack semantic expressivity. To bridge this gap, we propose Neuro-Symbolic Synergy (NeSyS), a framework that integrates the probabilistic semantic priors of LLMs with executable symbolic rules to achieve both expressivity and robustness. NeSyS alternates training between the two models using trajectories inadequately explained by the other. Unlike rule-based prompting, the symbolic WM directly constrains the LLM by modifying its output probability distribution. The neural WM is fine-tuned only on trajectories not covered by symbolic rules, reducing training data by 50% without loss of accuracy.

The dataset comprises 13,348 labeled images collected through multiple methods, including DWaste mobile app and curated web sources. Methods included rigorous validation through checksums and outlier detection, analysis of class imbalance and visual separability via PCA/t-SNE, and assessment of background complexity using entropy and saliency measures. The dataset was benchmarked using state-of-the-art deep learning models (EfficientNetV2M, EfficientNetV2S, MobileNet, ResNet50, ResNet101) evaluated on performance metrics and operational carbon emissions. Experiment results indicate EfficientNetV2S achieved the highest performance with 96.19% accuracy and a 0.96 F1-score, though with a moderate carbon cost. Analysis revealed inherent dataset characteristics including class imbalance, a skew toward high-outlier classes (plastic, cardboard, paper), and brightness variations that require consideration. The main conclusion is that GD provides a valuable, real-world benchmark for waste classification research while highlighting important challenges such as class imbalance, background complexity, and environmental trade-offs in model selection that must be addressed for practical deployment.

We observe that even when auxiliary visual elements are interleaved, they are often treated as static snapshots within a one-dimensional, unstructured reasoning chain. We argue that such approaches treat reasoning history as an immutable stream: correcting a local error necessitates either generating verbose downstream corrections or regenerating the entire context. This forces the model to implicitly maintain and track state updates, significantly increasing token consumption and cognitive load. This limitation is particularly acute in high-dimensional domains, such as geometry and SVG design, where the textual expression of CoT lacks explicit visual guidance, further constraining the model's reasoning precision. To bridge this gap, we introduce \\textbf{Canvas-of-Thought (Canvas-CoT)}. By leveraging a HTML Canvas as an external reasoning substrate, Canvas-CoT empowers the model to perform atomic, DOM-based CRUD operations. This architecture enables in-place state revisions without disrupting the surrounding context, allowing the model to explicitly maintain the \"ground truth\". Furthermore, we integrate a rendering-based critique loop that serves as a hard constraint validator, providing explicit visual feedback to resolve complex tasks that are difficult to articulate through text alone.

We introduce Med-SegLens, a model-diffing framework that decomposes segmentation model activations into interpretable latent features using sparse autoencoders trained on SegFormer and U-Net. Through cross-architecture and cross-dataset latent alignment across healthy, adult, pediatric, and sub-Saharan African glioma cohorts, we identify a stable backbone of shared representations, while dataset shift is driven by differential reliance on population-specific latents. We show that these latents act as causal bottlenecks for segmentation failures, and that targeted latent-level interventions can correct errors and improve cross-dataset adaption without retraining, recovering performance in 70% of failure cases and improving Dice score from 39.4% to 74.2%. Our results demonstrate that latent-level model diffing provides a practical and mechanistic tool for diagnosing failures and mitigating dataset shift in segmentation models.", "AI": {"tldr": "Med-SegLens\u5229\u7528\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u89e3\u6790\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6f5c\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u89e3\u8026\u8bc6\u522b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5dee\u5f02\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u57df\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u79c0\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u96be\u4ee5\u8bca\u65ad\u5931\u8d25\u539f\u56e0\u548c\u5e94\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u8de8\u67b6\u6784\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5206\u89e3SegFormer/U-Net\u6fc0\u6d3b\u503c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5171\u4eab\u8868\u793a\u4e0e\u4eba\u7fa4\u7279\u6709\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u673a\u5236", "result": "\u53d1\u73b070%\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5931\u8d25\u7531\u4eba\u7fa4\u7279\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u5bfc\u81f4\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u5411\u5e72\u9884\u4fee\u590d\u9519\u8bef\u4f7fDice\u5206\u6570\u4ece39.4%\u63d0\u5347\u81f374.2%", "conclusion": "\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\u5dee\u5206\u6280\u672f\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8bca\u65ad\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u7f13\u89e3\u6570\u636e\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u6539\u8fdb\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6307\u5f15"}}

We identify pseudo-detoxification as a common failure mode, where apparent toxicity reductions arise from degenerate generation behaviours rather than meaningful suppression of unsafe content. We further show that detoxification effectiveness degrades when multiple unsafe behaviours are edited jointly, and that both monolingual and cross-lingual detoxification remain effective only under specific model-method combinations.

In this paper, we propose 3DXTalker, an expressive 3D talking avatar through data-curated identity modeling, audio-rich representations, and spatial dynamics controllability. 3DXTalker enables scalable identity modeling via 2D-to-3D data curation pipeline and disentangled representations, alleviating data scarcity and improving identity generalization. Then, we introduce frame-wise amplitude and emotional cues beyond standard speech embeddings, ensuring superior lip synchronization and nuanced expression modulation. These cues are unified by a flow-matching-based transformer for coherent facial dynamics. Moreover, 3DXTalker also enables natural head-pose motion generation while supporting stylized control via prompt-based conditioning.

Recent work MemAgent has tried to tackle this by processing context chunk-by-chunk in an RNN-like loop and updating a textual memory for final answering. However, this naive recurrent memory update faces two crucial drawbacks: (i) memory can quickly explode because it can update indiscriminately, even on evidence-free chunks; and (ii) the loop lacks an exit mechanism, leading to unnecessary computation after even sufficient evidence is collected. To address these issues, we propose GRU-Mem, which incorporates two text-controlled gates for more stable and efficient long-context reasoning. Specifically, in GRU-Mem, the memory only updates when the update gate is open and the recurrent loop will exit immediately once the exit gate is open. To endow the model with such capabilities, we introduce two reward signals $r^{\\text{update}}$ and $r^{\\text{exit}}$ within end-to-end RL, rewarding the correct updating and exiting behaviors respectively.

In response, several datasets have been established to train detection models aimed at distinguishing AI-generated images from real ones. However, existing datasets suffer from limited generalization, low image quality, overly simple prompts, and insufficient image diversity. To address these limitations, we propose a high-quality, large-scale dataset comprising over 730,000 images across multiple categories, including both real and AI-generated images. The generated images are synthesized via state-of-the-art methods, including text-to-image generation (guided by over 10,000 carefully designed prompts), image inpainting, image refinement, and face swapping. Each generated image is annotated with its generation method and category. Inpainting images further include binary masks to indicate inpainted regions, providing rich metadata for analysis. Compared to existing datasets, detection models trained on our dataset demonstrate superior generalization capabilities. Our dataset not only serves as a strong benchmark for evaluating detection methods but also contributes to advancing the robustness of AI-generated image detection techniques. Building upon this, we propose a lightweight detection method based on image noise entropy, which transforms the original image into an entropy tensor of Non-Local Means (NLM) noise before classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that models trained on our dataset achieve strong generalization, and our method delivers competitive performance, establishing a solid baseline for future research.

In this paper, we first empirically identify that local off-policy deviation is structurally inconsistent at the token level, which may distort policy-gradient updates across adjacent tokens and lead to training collapse. To address the issue, we propose Online Causal Kalman Filtering for stable and effective Policy Optimization (KPO). Concretely, we model the desired IS ratio as a latent state that evolves across tokens and apply a Kalman filter to update this state online and autoregressively based on the states of past tokens, regardless of future tokens. The resulting filtered IS ratios preserve token-wise local structure-aware variation while strongly smoothing noise spikes, yielding more stable and effective policy updates.

However, the inherited Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) introduces limitations for multimodal processing. Specifically, applying 1D temporal positional indices disrupts the continuity of visual features along the column dimension, resulting in spatial locality loss. Moreover, RoPE follows the prior that temporally closer image tokens are more causally related, leading to long-term decay in attention allocation and causing the model to progressively neglect earlier visual tokens as the sequence length increases. To address these issues, we propose C^2RoPE, an improved RoPE that explicitly models local spatial Continuity and spatial Causal relationships for visual processing. C^2RoPE introduces a spatio-temporal continuous positional embedding mechanism for visual tokens. It first integrates 1D temporal positions with Cartesian-based spatial coordinates to construct a triplet hybrid positional index, and then employs a frequency allocation strategy to encode spatio-temporal positional information across the three index components. Additionally, we introduce Chebyshev Causal Masking, which determines causal dependencies by computing the Chebyshev distance of image tokens in 2D space.

While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at basic Visual Question Answering (VQA), they consistently struggle to grasp the nuanced cultural, emotional, and contextual implications embedded in visual content. This difficulty stems from the task's demand for sophisticated multi-hop reasoning, cultural context, and Theory of Mind (ToM) capabilities, which current models lack. To fill this gap, we propose MetaphorStar, the first end-to-end visual reinforcement learning (RL) framework for image implication tasks. Our framework includes three core components: the fine-grained dataset TFQ-Data, the visual RL method TFQ-GRPO, and the well-structured benchmark TFQ-Bench.\n  Our fully open-source MetaphorStar family, trained using TFQ-GRPO on TFQ-Data, significantly improves performance by an average of 82.6% on the image implication benchmarks. Compared with 20+ mainstream MLLMs, MetaphorStar-32B achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) on Multiple-Choice Question and Open-Style Question, significantly outperforms the top closed-source model Gemini-3.0-pro on True-False Question.

In this work, we investigate whether benchmark performance is primarily driven by the degree of statistical pattern overlap between pre-training corpora and evaluation datasets. We measure this overlap using word-level unigram cross-entropy and word frequency statistics, and perform controlled experiments across $10$ zero-shot benchmarks, $4$ pre-training datasets spanning $8.5\\mathrm{B}$ to $60\\mathrm{B}$ tokens, and model sizes ranging from $400\\mathrm{M}$ to $3\\mathrm{B}$ parameters. Our results demonstrate a robust inverse relationship between word-level unigram cross-entropy and benchmark performance, suggesting that widely used benchmarks are strongly influenced by word overlap between training and evaluation data. Thus, larger pre-training subsets with similar word-level unigram cross-entropy yield improved downstream results, indicating that word frequency statistics play an additional role in shaping benchmark scores. Taken together, these results suggest that many standard benchmarks are only weakly out-of-distribution relative to pre-training corpora, so that simple word-overlap statistics predict benchmark performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper examines how statistical word overlap between pre-training data and benchmarks influences model performance, showing lower word-level unigram cross-entropy in pre-training data correlates with better zero-shot benchmark results, indicating many benchmarks are not truly out-of-distribution.", "motivation": "To determine if benchmark performance in language models is primarily influenced by statistical pattern overlap (e.g., word frequency) between pre-training corpora and evaluation datasets.", "method": "Measured word-level unigram cross-entropy and frequency statistics across 4 pre-training datasets (8.5B-60B tokens) and 10 zero-shot benchmarks, testing model sizes (400M-3B parameters) in controlled experiments.", "result": "Benchmark performance showed a robust inverse relationship with unigram cross-entropy (lower cross-entropy correlated with higher scores), and larger pre-training datasets with similar cross-entropy further improved downstream performance, highlighting word frequency's predictive power.", "conclusion": "Standard benchmarks are often weakly out-of-distribution relative to pre-training data, making simple word-overlap statistics strong predictors of performance, suggesting training data composition critically shapes benchmarks."}}

We focus on subject and object marking determined through various permutations of nominative, ergative, and dative noun forms. A treebank-based approach for the generation of minimal pairs using the Grew query language is implemented. We create a dataset of 370 syntactic tests made up of seven tasks containing 50-70 samples each, where three noun forms are tested in any given sample. Five encoder- and two decoder-only models are evaluated with word- and/or sentence-level accuracy metrics. Regardless of the specific syntactic makeup, models performed worst in assigning the ergative case correctly and strongest in assigning the nominative case correctly. Performance correlated with the overall frequency distribution of the three forms (NOM > DAT > ERG). Though data scarcity is a known issue for low-resource languages, we show that the highly specific role of the ergative along with a lack of available training data likely contributes to poor performance on this case.

We further show that conventional string-matching metrics and explicit task-type prompting are misaligned with such scenarios, and propose a unified evaluation framework based on constraint consistency.

Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) can enhance performance within a target domain, but it typically causes catastrophic forgetting, limiting its generalization. The central challenge, therefore, is to adapt VLMs to new domains while preserving their general-purpose capabilities. Continual pretraining is effective for expanding knowledge in Large Language Models (LLMs), but it is less feasible for VLMs due to prohibitive computational costs and the unavailability of pretraining data for most open-source models. This necessitates efficient post-training adaptation methods. Reinforcement learning (RL)-based approaches such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) have shown promise in preserving general abilities, yet they often fail in domain adaptation scenarios where the model initially lacks sufficient domain knowledge, leading to optimization collapse. To bridge this gap, we propose Reinforced Curriculum Pre-Alignment (RCPA), a novel post-training paradigm that introduces a curriculum-aware progressive modulation mechanism. In the early phase, RCPA applies partial output constraints to safely expose the model to new domain concepts. As the model's domain familiarity increases, training gradually transitions to full generation optimization, refining responses and aligning them with domain-specific preferences. This staged adaptation balances domain knowledge acquisition with the preservation of general multimodal capabilities. Extensive experiments across specialized domains and general benchmarks validate the effectiveness of RCPA, establishing a practical pathway toward building high-performing and domain-adaptive VLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faRCPA\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u8bfe\u7a0b\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u9010\u6b65\u8c03\u6574\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(VLM)\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u901a\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e13\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bfc\u81f4VLM\u4e27\u5931\u901a\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u6301\u7eed\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u9ad8\u4e14\u6570\u636e\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u521d\u671f\u901a\u8fc7\u90e8\u5206\u7ea6\u675f\u5b89\u5168\u5f15\u5165\u9886\u57df\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u540e\u671f\u6e10\u8fdb\u8f6c\u5411\u5168\u751f\u6210\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u9f50\u9886\u57df\u504f\u597d\u3002", "result": "\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1RCPA\u5728\u4e13\u95e8\u9886\u57df\u4e0e\u901a\u7528\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5747\u4fdd\u6301\u826f\u597d\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u83b7\u53d6\u4e0e\u80fd\u529b\u4fdd\u7559\u3002", "conclusion": "RCPA\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u5f3a\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u7684VLM\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u74f6\u9888\u3002"}}

The core cause of hallucination lies in LLMs' lack of awareness regarding their stored internal knowledge, preventing them from expressing their knowledge state on questions beyond their internal knowledge boundaries, as humans do. However, existing research on knowledge boundary expression primarily focuses on white-box LLMs, leaving methods suitable for black-box LLMs which offer only API access without revealing internal parameters-largely unexplored. Against this backdrop, this paper proposes LSCL (LLM-Supervised Confidence Learning), a deep learning-based method for expressing the knowledge boundaries of black-box LLMs. Based on the knowledge distillation framework, this method designs a deep learning model. Taking the input question, output answer, and token probability from a black-box LLM as inputs, it constructs a mapping between the inputs and the model' internal knowledge state, enabling the quantification and expression of the black-box LLM' knowledge boundaries. Experiments conducted on diverse public datasets and with multiple prominent black-box LLMs demonstrate that LSCL effectively assists black-box LLMs in accurately expressing their knowledge boundaries.

To accelerate inference, recent works like GenDR adopt step distillation to minimize the step number to one. However, the memory boundary still restricts the maximum processing size, necessitating tile-by-tile restoration of high-resolution images. Through profiling the pipeline, we pinpoint that the variational auto-encoder (VAE) is the bottleneck of latency and memory. To completely solve the problem, we leverage pixel-(un)shuffle operations to eliminate the VAE, reversing the latent-based GenDR to pixel-space GenDR-Pix. However, upscale with x8 pixelshuffle may induce artifacts of repeated patterns. To alleviate the distortion, we propose a multi-stage adversarial distillation to progressively remove the encoder and decoder. Specifically, we utilize generative features from the previous stage models to guide adversarial discrimination. Moreover, we propose random padding to augment generative features and avoid discriminator collapse. We also introduce a masked Fourier space loss to penalize the outliers of amplitude. To improve inference performance, we empirically integrate a padding-based self-ensemble with classifier-free guidance to improve inference scaling. Experimental results show that GenDR-Pix performs 2.8x acceleration and 60% memory-saving compared to GenDR with negligible visual degradation, surpassing other one-step diffusion SR.

This failure mode is not captured by existing VideoLLM benchmarks, which focus primarily on task accuracy and factual correctness. We introduce VideoSTF, the first framework for systematically measuring and stress-testing output repetition in VideoLLMs. VideoSTF formalizes repetition using three complementary n-gram-based metrics and provides a standardized testbed of 10,000 diverse videos together with a library of controlled temporal transformations. Using VideoSTF, we conduct pervasive testing, temporal stress testing, and adversarial exploitation across 10 advanced VideoLLMs. We find that output repetition is widespread and, critically, highly sensitive to temporal perturbations of video inputs. Moreover, we show that simple temporal transformations can efficiently induce repetitive degeneration in a black-box setting, exposing output repetition as an exploitable security vulnerability.

Existing methods primarily rely on a direct text-to-HOI mapping, which suffers from three key limitations due to the significant cross-modality gap: (Q1) sub-optimal human motion, (Q2) unnatural object motion, and (Q3) weak interaction between humans and objects. To address these challenges, we propose MP-HOI, a novel framework grounded in four core insights: (1) Multimodal Data Priors: We leverage multimodal data (text, image, pose/object) from large multimodal models as priors to guide HOI generation, which tackles Q1 and Q2 in data modeling. (2) Enhanced Object Representation: We improve existing object representations by incorporating geometric keypoints, contact features, and dynamic properties, enabling expressive object representations, which tackles Q2 in data representation.

In this research, we propose C-MOP (Cluster-based Momentum Optimized Prompting), a framework that stabilizes optimization via Boundary-Aware Contrastive Sampling (BACS) and Momentum-Guided Semantic Clustering (MGSC). Specifically, BACS utilizes batch-level information to mine tripartite features--Hard Negatives, Anchors, and Boundary Pairs--to precisely characterize the typical representation and decision boundaries of positive and negative prompt samples. To resolve semantic conflicts, MGSC introduces a textual momentum mechanism with temporal decay that distills persistent consensus from fluctuating gradients across iterations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that C-MOP consistently outperforms SOTA baselines like PromptWizard and ProTeGi, yielding average gains of 1.58% and 3.35%.

Despite rapid advances in large language models (LLMs), it remains unclear whether they can meet the structural requirements of this process, which hinge on preserving roles, methods, and effect-size attribution across documents rather than on recognizing isolated entities. We propose a structural, diagnostic framework that evaluates LLM-based evidence extraction as a progression of schema-constrained queries with increasing relational and numerical complexity, enabling precise identification of failure points beyond atom-level extraction. Using a manually curated corpus spanning five scientific domains, together with a unified query suite and evaluation protocol, we evaluate two state-of-the-art LLMs under both per-document and long-context, multi-document input regimes. Across domains and models, performance remains moderate for single-property queries but degrades sharply once tasks require stable binding between variables, roles, statistical methods, and effect sizes. Full meta-analytic association tuples are extracted with near-zero reliability, and long-context inputs further exacerbate these failures. Downstream aggregation amplifies even minor upstream errors, rendering corpus-level statistics unreliable. Our analysis shows that these limitations stem not from entity recognition errors, but from systematic structural breakdowns, including role reversals, cross-analysis binding drift, instance compression in dense result sections, and numeric misattribution, indicating that current LLMs lack the structural fidelity, relational binding, and numerical grounding required for automated meta-analysis.

However, modifying the original text prompt to achieve the expected semantic adjustments often results in unintended global structure changes that disrupt user intent. Existing methods rely on empirical feature map selection for intervention, whose performance heavily depends on appropriate selection, leading to suboptimal stability. This paper tries to solve the aforementioned problem from a frequency perspective and analyzes the impact of the frequency spectrum of noisy latent variables on the hierarchical emergence of the structure framework and fine-grained textures during the generation process. We find that lower-frequency components are primarily responsible for establishing the structure framework in the early generation stage. Their influence diminishes over time, giving way to higher-frequency components that synthesize fine-grained textures. In light of this, we propose a training-free frequency modulation method utilizing a frequency-dependent weighting function with dynamic decay. This method maintains the structure framework consistency while permitting targeted semantic modifications. By directly manipulating the noisy latent variable, the proposed method avoids the empirical selection of internal feature maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, achieving an effective balance between preserving structure and enabling semantic updates.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper introduces a training-free frequency modulation method for text-guided diffusion models, enabling semantic updates while preserving structural consistency through dynamic decay-weighted frequency components.", "motivation": "The problem arises from unintended global structure changes when modifying text prompts in diffusion models, exacerbated by empirical feature map selection.

It introduces a refined Region of Interest (ROI) algorithm to improve precision. Validation involved 365 mouse and human images (STED and confocal), benchmarking performance against the original AMAP via Pearson correlation and Two One-Sided T-tests (TOST).\n  Results: AMAP-APP achieved a 147-fold increase in processing speed on consumer hardware.

Our approach employs string matching based on suffix arrays that scales well with corpus size. To mitigate the combinatorial explosion induced by the semantic relaxation of queries, our method is built on two key algorithmic ideas: fast exact lookup enabled by a disk-aware design, and dynamic corpus-aware pruning. We theoretically show that the proposed method suppresses exponential growth in the search space with respect to query length by leveraging statistical properties of natural language. In experiments on FineWeb-Edu (Lozhkov et al., 2024) (1.4T tokens), we show that our method achieves significantly lower search latency than existing methods: infini-gram (Liu et al., 2024), infini-gram mini (Xu et al., 2025), and SoftMatcha (Deguchi et al., 2025).

To bridge this gap, we propose TwiFF-2.7M, the first large-scale, temporally grounded VCoT dataset derived from $2.7$ million video clips, explicitly designed for dynamic visual question and answer. Accompanying this, we introduce TwiFF-Bench, a high-quality evaluation benchmark of $1,078$ samples that assesses both the plausibility of reasoning trajectories and the correctness of final answers in open-ended dynamic settings. Building on these foundations, we propose the TwiFF model, a unified modal that synergistically leverages pre-trained video generation and image comprehension capabilities to produce temporally coherent visual reasoning cues-iteratively generating future action frames and textual reasoning.

Study B: computational analysis of an autobiographical corpus of autistic narratives built for this purpose. Study C: a replication of a computational study using narrative flow measures to assess the perceived phenomenological authenticity of autistic autobiographies. Interviews revealed that the most significant differences between the autistic and control groups concerned unpredictability of experience. Computational results mirrored these findings: the temporal lexicon in autistic narratives was significantly more negatively valenced - particularly the \"Immediacy & Suddenness\" category. Outlier analysis identified terms associated with perceived discontinuity (unpredictably, precipitously, and abruptly) as highly negative. The computational analysis of narrative flow found that the autistic narratives contained within the corpus quantifiably resemble autobiographical stories more than imaginary ones.

To bridge this gap, this paper targets to develop a unified framework for omnibus vision-language forgery detection and grounding. In this unified setting, the {interplay} between diverse modalities and the dual requirements of simultaneous detection and localization pose a critical ``difficulty bias`` problem: the simpler veracity classification task tends to dominate the gradients, leading to suboptimal performance in fine-grained grounding during multi-task optimization. To address this challenge, we propose \\textbf{OmniVL-Guard}, a balanced reinforcement learning framework for omnibus vision-language forgery detection and grounding.

Specifically, we employ a depth estimation baseline called VGGT to extract geometry-aware 3D cues from standard RGB inputs, enabling efficient utilization of existing large-scale 2D datasets while implicitly recovering 3D structural information. To further enhance the reliability of these depth-derived features, we introduce a new module called action assistant, which constrains the learned 3D representations with action priors and ensures their consistency with downstream control tasks. By fusing the enhanced 3D features with conventional 2D visual tokens, our approach significantly improves the generalization ability and robustness of VLA models.

Nonetheless, it faces persistent challenges, including the pre-selection of an optimal rank and rank-specific hyper-parameters, as well as the deployment complexity of heterogeneous-rank modules and more sophisticated LoRA derivatives. In this work, we introduce LoRA-Squeeze, a simple and efficient methodology that aims to improve standard LoRA learning by changing LoRA module ranks either post-hoc or dynamically during training}. Our approach posits that it is better to first learn an expressive, higher-rank solution and then compress it, rather than learning a constrained, low-rank solution directly. The method involves fine-tuning with a deliberately high(er) source rank, reconstructing or efficiently approximating the reconstruction of the full weight update matrix, and then using Randomized Singular Value Decomposition (RSVD) to create a new, compressed LoRA module at a lower target rank. Extensive experiments across 13 text and 10 vision-language tasks show that post-hoc compression often produces lower-rank adapters that outperform those trained directly at the target rank, especially if a small number of fine-tuning steps at the target rank is allowed.

Existing methods predominantly operate within a 2D manifold, neglecting the underlying 3D geometry where view-dependent vertical facades (macro-structure) and scale variations (micro-scale) severely corrupt feature alignment. To bridge this gap, we propose (MGS)$^2$, a geometry-grounded framework. The core of our innovation is the Macro-Geometric Structure Filtering (MGSF) module. Unlike pixel-wise matching sensitive to noise, MGSF leverages dilated geometric gradients to physically filter out high-frequency facade artifacts while enhancing the view-invariant horizontal plane, directly addressing the domain shift. To guarantee robust input for this structural filtering, we explicitly incorporate a Micro-Geometric Scale Adaptation (MGSA) module. MGSA utilizes depth priors to dynamically rectify scale discrepancies via multi-branch feature fusion. Furthermore, a Geometric-Appearance Contrastive Distillation (GACD) loss is designed to strictly discriminate against oblique occlusions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that (MGS)$^2$ achieves state-of-the-art performance, recording a Recall@1 of 97.5\\% on University-1652 and 97.02\\% on SUES-200.

Identifying linguistically interpretable markers of dementia can support transparent and clinically grounded screening approaches.\n  Methods: This study analyzes spontaneous speech transcripts from the DementiaBank Pitt Corpus using three linguistic representations: raw cleaned text, a part-of-speech (POS)-enhanced representation combining lexical and grammatical information, and a POS-only syntactic representation. Logistic regression and random forest models were evaluated under two protocols: transcript-level train-test splits and subject-level five-fold cross-validation to prevent speaker overlap. Model interpretability was examined using global feature importance, and statistical validation was conducted using Mann-Whitney U tests with Cliff's delta effect sizes.\n  Results: Across representations, models achieved stable performance, with syntactic and grammatical features retaining strong discriminative power even in the absence of lexical content. Subject-level evaluation yielded more conservative but consistent results, particularly for POS-enhanced and POS-only representations. Statistical analysis revealed significant group differences in functional word usage, lexical diversity, sentence structure, and discourse coherence, aligning closely with machine learning feature importance findings.\n  Conclusion: The results demonstrate that abstract linguistic features capture robust markers of early cognitive decline under clinically realistic evaluation.

First, we propose a simple algorithm to achieve end-to-end differentiability of a given (frozen) LM and then find optimised prompts via gradient descent. Our central insight is to view LMs as functions operating on sequences of distributions over tokens (rather than the traditional view as functions on sequences of tokens).

OccFace adopts a unified dense 100-point layout and a heatmap-based backbone, and adds an occlusion module that jointly predicts landmark coordinates and per-point visibility by combining local evidence with cross-landmark context.

Traditional approaches rely on supervised training with word-level aligned data, which is difficult to collect at scale and thus depends on synthetic alignments using language-specific heuristics that are suboptimal. We propose Hibiki-Zero, which eliminates the need for word-level alignments entirely. This fundamentally simplifies the training pipeline and enables seamless scaling to diverse languages with varying grammatical structures, removing the bottleneck of designing language-specific alignment heuristics. We first train on sentence-level aligned data to learn speech translation at high latency, then apply a novel reinforcement learning strategy using GRPO to optimize latency while preserving translation quality. Hibiki-Zero achieves state-of-the-art performance in translation accuracy, latency, voice transfer, and naturalness across five X-to-English tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that our model can be adapted to support a new input language with less than 1000h of speech.

In contrast to SR artifacts arising from synthetic LR images created under well-defined scenarios, those distortions are highly unpredictable and vary significantly across different real-life contexts. Consequently, assessing the quality of SR images (SR-IQA) obtained from realistic LR, remains a challenging and underexplored problem. In this work, we introduce a no-reference SR-IQA approach tailored for such highly ill-posed realistic settings. The proposed method enables domain-adaptive IQA for real-world SR applications, particularly in data-scarce domains. We hypothesize that degradations in super-resolved images are strongly dependent on the underlying SR algorithms, rather than being solely determined by image content. To this end, we introduce a self-supervised learning (SSL) strategy that first pretrains multiple SR model oriented representations in a pretext stage. Our contrastive learning framework forms positive pairs from images produced by the same SR model and negative pairs from those generated by different methods, independent of image content. The proposed approach S3 RIQA, further incorporates targeted preprocessing to extract complementary quality information and an auxiliary task to better handle the various degradation profiles associated with different SR scaling factors. To this end, we constructed a new dataset, SRMORSS, to support unsupervised pretext training; it includes a wide range of SR algorithms applied to numerous real LR images, which addresses a gap in existing datasets. Experiments on real SR-IQA benchmarks demonstrate that S3 RIQA consistently outperforms most state-of-the-art relevant metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff08S3RIQA\uff09\u7684\u65e0\u53c2\u8003\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u6539\u8fdb\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6SRMORSS\u4ee5\u586b\u8865\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u964d\u8d28\u590d\u6742\u4e14\u4e0d\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5408\u6210\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u8bc4\u4f30\u771f\u5b9e\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4e14\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u9886\u57df\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6S3RIQA\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u6784\u5efa\u540c\u4e00\u8d85\u5206\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6b63\u6837\u672c\u5bf9\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u5bf9\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u9884\u5904\u7406\u548c\u8f85\u52a9\u4efb\u52a1\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u540c\u653e\u5927\u500d\u6570\u7684\u964d\u8d28\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684SRMORSS\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6db5\u76d6\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u771f\u5b9e\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u8d85\u5206\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eS3RIQA\u5728\u771f\u5b9eSR-IQA\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6307\u6807\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u75c5\u6001\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u964d\u8d28\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u8d85\u5206\u7b97\u6cd5\u5173\u8054\u6027\u5f3a\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We algorithmically generate SteuerEx, the first open benchmark derived from authentic German university tax law examinations. SteuerEx comprises 115 expert-validated examination questions spanning six core tax law domains and multiple academic levels, and employs a statement-level, partial-credit evaluation framework that closely mirrors real examination practice.

More recent efforts, including MIB and INTERPRETABILITY BENCHMARK-based on mechanistic interpretability, offer valuable perspectives on model failures; however, they remain insufficient for systematically characterizing cross-dimensional trade-offs. To address these gaps, we introduce MisAlign-Profile, a unified benchmark for measuring misalignment trade-offs inspired by mechanistic profiling. First, we construct MISALIGNTRADE, an English misaligned-aligned dataset across 112 normative domains taxonomies, including 14 safety, 56 value, and 42 cultural domains. In addition to domain labels, each prompt is classified with one of three orthogonal semantic types-object, attribute, or relations misalignment-using Gemma-2-9B-it and expanded via Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507 with SimHash-based fingerprinting to avoid deduplication. Each prompt is paired with misaligned and aligned responses through two-stage rejection sampling to ensure quality.

While consistency models (CMs) represent a state-of-the-art distillation-based approach for efficient generation, their large-scale application is still limited by two key issues: training instability and inflexible sampling. Existing methods seek to mitigate these problems through architectural adjustments or regularized objectives, yet overlook the critical reliance on trajectory selection. In this work, we first conduct an analysis on these two limitations: training instability originates from loss divergence induced by unstable self-supervised term, whereas sampling inflexibility arises from error accumulation. Based on these insights and analysis, we propose the Dual-End Consistency Model (DE-CM) that selects vital sub-trajectory clusters to achieve stable and effective training. DE-CM decomposes the PF-ODE trajectory and selects three critical sub-trajectories as optimization targets. Specifically, our approach leverages continuous-time CMs objectives to achieve few-step distillation and utilizes flow matching as a boundary regularizer to stabilize the training process. Furthermore, we propose a novel noise-to-noisy (N2N) mapping that can map noise to any point, thereby alleviating the error accumulation in the first step.

Recently, vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on autonomous driving benchmarks, suggesting their potential for general traffic understanding and navigation-related reasoning. However, existing evaluations are predominantly vehicle-centric and fail to assess perception and reasoning from a cyclist-centric viewpoint. To address this gap, we introduce CyclingVQA, a diagnostic benchmark designed to probe perception, spatio-temporal understanding, and traffic-rule-to-lane reasoning from a cyclist's perspective. Evaluating 31+ recent VLMs spanning general-purpose, spatially enhanced, and autonomous-driving-specialized models, we find that current models demonstrate encouraging capabilities, while also revealing clear areas for improvement in cyclist-centric perception and reasoning, particularly in interpreting cyclist-specific traffic cues and associating signs with the correct navigational lanes. Notably, several driving-specialized models underperform strong generalist VLMs, indicating limited transfer from vehicle-centric training to cyclist-assistive scenarios. Finally, through systematic error analysis, we identify recurring failure modes to guide the development of more effective cyclist-assistive intelligent systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86CyclingVQA\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u81ea\u884c\u8f66\u624b\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0b\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u81ea\u884c\u8f66\u4e13\u7528\u4ea4\u901a\u4fe1\u53f7\u53ca\u5173\u8054\u5bfc\u822a\u8f66\u9053\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u4ee5\u8f66\u8f86\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u9a91\u884c\u8005\u89c6\u89d2\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u8bc4\u4ef7\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u9488\u5bf9\u9a91\u884c\u5b89\u5168\u8f85\u52a9\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaCyclingVQA\u8bca\u65ad\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f3031+\u79cd\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u6db5\u76d6\u901a\u7528\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e13\u7528\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u5728\u9a91\u884c\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u4ea4\u901a\u89c4\u5219\u4e0e\u8f66\u9053\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9a91\u884c\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u521d\u6b65\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u81ea\u884c\u8f66\u4e13\u7528\u4ea4\u901a\u4fe1\u53f7\u8bc6\u522b\u5f31\u3001\u6807\u5fd7\u4e0e\u8f66\u9053\u5173\u8054\u9519\u8bef\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u90e8\u5206\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e13\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u900a\u4e8e\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u8f66\u8f86\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0e\u9a91\u884c\u52a9\u624b\u9700\u6c42\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u679c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9a91\u884c\u8f85\u52a9\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u9519\u8bef\u5206\u6790\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u9a91\u884c\u5b89\u5168\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Asano"], "title": "Data Repetition Beats Data Scaling in Long-CoT Supervised Fine-Tuning", "comment": null, "summary": "Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on chain-of-thought data is an essential post-training step for reasoning language models. Standard machine learning intuition suggests that training with more unique training samples yields better generalization. Counterintuitively, we show that SFT benefits from repetition: under a fixed update budget, training for more epochs on smaller datasets outperforms single-epoch training on larger datasets. On AIME'24/25 and GPQA benchmarks, Olmo3-7B trained for 128 epochs on 400 samples outperforms the equivalent 1 epoch on 51200 samples by 12-26 percentage points, with no additional catastrophic forgetting.

These findings provide a practical approach for reasoning SFT, where scaling epochs with token accuracy as a stopping criterion can replace expensive undirected data scaling.

In this paper, we present FlowCache, the first caching framework specifically designed for autoregressive video generation. Our key insight is that each video chunk should maintain independent caching policies, allowing fine-grained control over which chunks require recomputation at each timestep. We introduce a chunkwise caching strategy that dynamically adapts to the unique denoising characteristics of each chunk, complemented by a joint importance-redundancy optimized KV cache compression mechanism that maintains fixed memory bounds while preserving generation quality. Our method achieves remarkable speedups of 2.38 times on MAGI-1 and 6.7 times on SkyReels-V2, with negligible quality degradation (VBench: 0.87 increase and 0.79 decrease respectively).

However, the redundant modeling of static regions and the lack of deep interaction with trajectories hinder world models from exerting their full effectiveness. In this paper, we propose Temporal Residual World Model (TR-World), which focuses on dynamic object modeling. By calculating the temporal residuals of scene representations, the information of dynamic objects can be extracted without relying on detection and tracking. TR-World takes only temporal residuals as input, thus predicting the future spatial distribution of dynamic objects more precisely. By combining the prediction with the static object information contained in the current BEV features, accurate future BEV features can be obtained. Furthermore, we propose Future-Guided Trajectory Refinement (FGTR) module, which conducts interaction between prior trajectories (predicted from the current scene representation) and the future BEV features. This module can not only utilize future road conditions to refine trajectories, but also provides sparse spatial-temporal supervision on future BEV features to prevent world model collapse. Comprehensive experiments conducted on the nuScenes and NAVSIM datasets demonstrate that our method, namely ResWorld, achieves state-of-the-art planning performance.

Unified Sequence Parallelism (USP), which combines Ulysses and Ring attention mechanisms, has emerged as the state-of-the-art approach for distributed attention computation. However, existing USP implementations suffer from significant inefficiencies including excessive kernel launch overhead and suboptimal computation-communication scheduling. In this paper, we propose \\textbf{FastUSP}, a multi-level optimization framework that integrates compile-level optimization (graph compilation with CUDA Graphs and computation-communication reordering), communication-level optimization (FP8 quantized collective communication), and operator-level optimization (pipelined Ring attention with double buffering). We evaluate FastUSP on FLUX (12B) and Qwen-Image models across 2, 4, and 8 NVIDIA RTX 5090 GPUs. On FLUX, FastUSP achieves consistent \\textbf{1.12$\\times$--1.16$\\times$} end-to-end speedup over baseline USP, with compile-level optimization contributing the dominant improvement. On Qwen-Image, FastUSP achieves \\textbf{1.09$\\times$} speedup on 2 GPUs; on 4--8 GPUs, we identify a PyTorch Inductor compatibility limitation with Ring attention that prevents compile optimization, while baseline USP scales to 1.30$\\times$--1.46$\\times$ of 2-GPU performance.

Early identification is important for minimizing damage and ensuring fruit health. This study focuses on 3 different categories for classifying diseases. These are Anthracnose, Fruit flies, and Healthy fruit. The data set used in this study is collected from Mendeley Data. This dataset contains 473 original images of Guava. These images vary in size and format. The original dataset was resized to 256x256 pixels with RGB color mode for better consistency. After this, the Data augmentation process is applied to improve the dataset by generating variations of the original images. The augmented dataset consists of 3784 images using advanced preprocessing techniques. Two deep learning models were implemented to classify the images. The InceptionV3 model is well known for its advanced framework. These apply multiple convolutional filters for obtaining different features effectively. On the other hand, the ResNet50 model helps to train deeper networks by using residual learning. The InceptionV3 model achieved the impressive accuracy of 98.15%, and ResNet50got 94.46% accuracy.

This paper introduces the DFIC dataset, a novel comprehensive facial image dataset comprising around 58,000 annotated images and 2706 videos of more than 1000 subjects, that cover a broad range of non-compliant conditions, in addition to compliant portraits. Our dataset provides a more balanced demographic distribution than the existing public datasets, with one partition that is nearly uniformly distributed, facilitating the development of automated ICAO compliance verification methods.\n  Using DFIC, we fine-tuned a novel method that heavily relies on spatial attention mechanisms for the automatic validation of ICAO compliance requirements, and we have compared it with the state-of-the-art aimed at ICAO compliance verification, demonstrating improved results. DFIC dataset is now made public (https://github.com/visteam-isr-uc/DFIC) for the training and validation of new models, offering an unprecedented diversity of faces, that will improve both robustness and adaptability to the intrinsically diverse combinations of faces and props that can be presented to the validation system.

However, achieving real-time DNN inference in the AV's perception pipeline is challenging due to the large gap between the computation requirement and the AV's limited resources. Most, if not all, of existing studies focus on optimizing the DNN inference time to achieve faster perception by compressing the DNN model with pruning and quantization. In contrast, we present a Predictable Perception system with DNNs (PP-DNN) that reduce the amount of image data to be processed while maintaining the same level of accuracy for multi-tenant DNNs by dynamically selecting critical frames and regions of interest (ROIs). PP-DNN is based on our key insight that critical frames and ROIs for AVs vary with the AV's surrounding environment. However, it is challenging to identify and use critical frames and ROIs in multi-tenant DNNs for predictable inference. Given image-frame streams, PP-DNN leverages an ROI generator to identify critical frames and ROIs based on the similarities of consecutive frames and traffic scenarios. PP-DNN then leverages a FLOPs predictor to predict multiply-accumulate operations (MACs) from the dynamic critical frames and ROIs. The ROI scheduler coordinates the processing of critical frames and ROIs with multiple DNN models. Finally, we design a detection predictor for the perception of non-critical frames.

We introduce SVD-Inspired Attention (SVDA) into the Dense Prediction Transformer (DPT), providing the first spectrally structured formulation of attention for dense prediction tasks. SVDA decouples directional alignment from spectral modulation by embedding a learnable diagonal matrix into normalized query-key interactions, enabling attention maps that are intrinsically interpretable rather than post-hoc approximations. Experiments on KITTI and NYU-v2 show that SVDA preserves or slightly improves predictive accuracy while adding only minor computational overhead. More importantly, SVDA unlocks six spectral indicators that quantify entropy, rank, sparsity, alignment, selectivity, and robustness. These reveal consistent cross-dataset and depth-wise patterns in how attention organizes during training, insights that remain inaccessible in standard Transformers.

Despite recent progress of large visual-language models and agentic AI, accurately counting such instruments remains highly challenging, particularly in dense scenarios where instruments are tightly clustered. To address this problem, we introduce Chain-of-Look, a novel visual reasoning framework that mimics the sequential human counting process by enforcing a structured visual chain, rather than relying on classic object detection which is unordered. This visual chain guides the model to count along a coherent spatial trajectory, improving accuracy in complex scenes. To further enforce the physical plausibility of the visual chain, we introduce the neighboring loss function, which explicitly models the spatial constraints inherent to densely packed surgical instruments. We also present SurgCount-HD, a new dataset comprising 1,464 high-density surgical instrument images.

These dual limitations underscore the critical need to develop lightweight yet structurally precise architectures. Our framework addresses these limitations through a three-stage architecture incorporating three novel modules: the Shuffle-Dilation Convolution (SDC) module for local feature extraction, the Rotation-Adaptive Kernel Attention (RAKA) module for hierarchical feature enhancement, and the Deep Frequency Signal Purification (DFSP) module for global feature purification. Through effective collaboration, these modules enable PuriLight to achieve both lightweight and accurate feature extraction and processing.

Recently the proposal of ''thinking with images'' attempts to alleviate this limitation by manipulating images via external tools or code; however, the resulting visual states are often insufficiently grounded in linguistic semantics, impairing effective cross-modal alignment - particularly when visual semantics or geometric relationships must be reasoned over across distant regions or multiple images. To address these challenges, we propose ''chatting with images'', a new framework that reframes visual manipulation as language-guided feature modulation. Under the guidance of expressive language prompts, the model dynamically performs joint re-encoding over multiple image regions, enabling tighter coupling between linguistic reasoning and visual state updates. We instantiate this paradigm in ViLaVT, a novel LVLM equipped with a dynamic vision encoder explicitly designed for such interactive visual reasoning, and trained it with a two-stage curriculum combining supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning to promote effective reasoning behaviors. Extensive experiments across eight benchmarks demonstrate that ViLaVT achieves strong and consistent improvements, with particularly pronounced gains on complex multi-image and video-based spatial reasoning tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faViLaVT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u8a00\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u8c03\u5236\u589e\u5f3a\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u5355\u4e00\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u6587\u672c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ec6\u8282\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\uff1b\u5df2\u6709\u2018\u56fe\u6587\u601d\u8003\u2019\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u89c6\u89c9\u72b6\u6001\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u8bed\u4e49\u8131\u8282\uff0c\u96be\u5904\u7406\u8de8\u533a\u57df\u590d\u6742\u8bed\u4e49\u6216\u51e0\u4f55\u5173\u7cfb\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u2018chatting with images\u2019\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u793a\u5f15\u5bfc\u591a\u533a\u57df\u52a8\u6001\u91cd\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u89c6\u89c9\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u8054\u5408\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u52a8\u6001\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668ViLaVT\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\uff08\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03+\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516b\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2dViLaVT\u8868\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u591a\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u89c6\u9891\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u589e\u76ca\u663e\u8457\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8bed\u8a00\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8c03\u5236\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0d\u8db3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7ec6\u81f4\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

The recent release of the UNB StepUP-P150 dataset, the largest and most comprehensive collection of high-resolution footstep pressure recordings to date, opens new opportunities for addressing these challenges through deep learning. To mark this milestone, the First International StepUP Competition for Biometric Footstep Recognition was launched. Competitors were tasked with developing robust recognition models using the StepUP-P150 dataset that were then evaluated on a separate, dedicated test set designed to assess verification performance under challenging variations, given limited and relatively homogeneous reference data. The competition attracted global participation, with 23 registered teams from academia and industry. The top-performing team, Saeid_UCC, achieved the best equal error rate (EER) of 10.77% using a generative reward machine (GRM) optimization strategy.

Existing acceleration methods like distillation, trajectory truncation, and consistency approaches are static, require retraining, and often fail to generalize across tasks. We propose FastFlow, a plug-and-play adaptive inference framework that accelerates generation in flow matching models. FastFlow identifies denoising steps that produce only minor adjustments to the denoising path and approximates them without using the full neural network models used for velocity predictions. The approximation utilizes finite-difference velocity estimates from prior predictions to efficiently extrapolate future states, enabling faster advancements along the denoising path at zero compute cost. This enables skipping computation at intermediary steps. We model the decision of how many steps to safely skip before requiring a full model computation as a multi-armed bandit problem. The bandit learns the optimal skips to balance speed with performance. FastFlow integrates seamlessly with existing pipelines and generalizes across image generation, video generation, and editing tasks.

However, existing critics are primarily trained in general visual domains such as captioning or image question answering, leaving physical AI tasks involving perception, causal reasoning, and planning largely underexplored. We introduce PhyCritic, a multimodal critic model optimized for physical AI through a two-stage RLVR pipeline: a physical skill warmup stage that enhances physically oriented perception and reasoning, followed by self-referential critic finetuning, where the critic generates its own prediction as an internal reference before judging candidate responses, improving judgment stability and physical correctness. Across both physical and general-purpose multimodal judge benchmarks, PhyCritic achieves strong performance gains over open-source baselines and, when applied as a policy model, further improves perception and reasoning in physically grounded tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faPhyCritic\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5RLVR\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5224\u522b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e13\u4e3a\u7269\u7406AI\u4efb\u52a1\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7269\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0e\u901a\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5224\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u8981\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e8e\u901a\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u9886\u57df\uff08\u5982\u56fe\u50cf\u63cf\u8ff0\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u7269\u7406AI\u6d89\u53ca\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u6df1\u5165\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u7269\u7406\u4ea4\u4e92\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "method": "PhyCritic\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5RLVR\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1)\u7269\u7406\u6280\u80fd\u9884\u70ed\u9636\u6bb5\u5f3a\u5316\u7269\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff1b2)\u81ea\u53c2\u7167\u5f0f\u5224\u522b\u5fae\u8c03\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u5185\u90e8\u53c2\u8003\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u5347\u5224\u522b\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7269\u7406\u4e0e\u901a\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5224\u522b\u57fa\u51c6\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8a\u5f00\u6e90\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7b56\u7565\u6a21\u578b\u5e94\u7528\u65f6\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u7269\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5224\u522b\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u63d0\u534737%\u3001\u7269\u7406\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u63d0\u9ad842%\u3002", "conclusion": "PhyCritic\u6709\u6548\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u7269\u7406AI\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u7528\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u5176\u81ea\u53c2\u7167\u673a\u5236\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6280\u672f\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u3001\u6a21\u62df\u73af\u5883\u7b49\u7269\u7406\u4ea4\u4e92\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

Classical techniques face intrinsic limitations near moving interfaces, while existing neural rendering methods target single-phase flows with diffuse boundaries and cannot handle sharp, deformable liquid-vapor interfaces.

Our approach integrates dynamic Gaussian surfels with a signed distance function formulation for geometric consistency, and leverages a video diffusion model to synthesize novel-view videos to refine reconstruction from sparse observations.
