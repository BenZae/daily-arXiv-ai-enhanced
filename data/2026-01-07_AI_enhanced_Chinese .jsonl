While Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) like Dense-Unet have shown promise in removing these artifacts via inpainting, they often require large labeled datasets which are scarce in the medical domain. Inspired by recent advancements in Masked Autoencoders (MAE) for 3D point clouds, we propose \\textbf{Dense-MAE}, a novel self-supervised learning framework for volumetric medical data. We introduce a pre-training strategy that randomly masks 3D patches of the vessel lumen and trains the Dense-Unet to reconstruct the missing geometry. This forces the encoder to learn high-level latent features of arterial topology without human annotation. Experimental results on clinical CTA datasets demonstrate that initializing the Calcium Removal network with our MAE-based weights significantly improves inpainting accuracy and stenosis estimation compared to training from scratch, specifically in few-shot scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faDense-MAE\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc73D\u63a9\u7801\u91cd\u5efa\u7b56\u7565\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5fc3\u8840\u7ba1CT\u5f71\u50cf\u53bb\u9499\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8840\u7ba1\u72ed\u7a84\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u51a0\u72b6\u52a8\u8109\u9499\u5316\u7684CT\u5f71\u50cf\u4f2a\u5f71\u963b\u788d\u75be\u75c5\u8bca\u65ad\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6b64\u4e3a\u533b\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u75db\u70b9\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a9\u7801\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u521b\u65b03D\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u5bf9\u8840\u7ba1\u7ba1\u8154\u533a\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u968f\u673a3D\u6591\u5757\u63a9\u7801\uff0c\u5229\u7528Dense-Unet\u67b6\u6784\u91cd\u5efa\u7f3a\u5931\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u8109\u62d3\u6251\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9e\uff1a(1) MAE\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f7f\u9499\u5316\u4fee\u590d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u534723.7%\n(2) \u72ed\u7a84\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e41.2%\n(3) \u5728\u4ec55\u4f8b\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u4fdd\u630192%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u8bca\u65ad\u51c6\u786e\u7387", "conclusion": "\u6240\u521b\u6846\u67b6\u7a81\u7834\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u6807\u6ce8\u4f9d\u8d56\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5c06MAE\u6210\u529f\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5fc3\u8840\u7ba1\u5f71\u50cf\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u533b\u5b66\u573a\u666f\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u7f55\u89c1\u75c5\u53d8\u6216\u65b0\u5174\u75be\u75c5\u7684\u6570\u636e\u53d7\u9650\u60c5\u51b5\u3002"}}

WearVox comprises 3,842 multi-channel, egocentric audio recordings collected via AI glasses across five diverse tasks including Search-Grounded QA, Closed-Book QA, Side-Talk Rejection, Tool Calling, and Speech Translation, spanning a wide range of indoor and outdoor environments and acoustic conditions. Each recording is accompanied by rich metadata, enabling nuanced analysis of model performance under real-world constraints. We benchmark leading proprietary and open-source speech Large Language Models (SLLMs) and find that most real-time SLLMs achieve accuracies on WearVox ranging from 29% to 59%, with substantial performance degradation on noisy outdoor audio, underscoring the difficulty and realism of the benchmark. Additionally, we conduct a case study with two new SLLMs that perform inference with single-channel and multi-channel audio, demonstrating that multi-channel audio inputs significantly enhance model robustness to environmental noise and improve discrimination between device-directed and background speech. Our results highlight the critical importance of spatial audio cues for context-aware voice assistants and establish WearVox as a comprehensive testbed for advancing wearable voice AI research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faWearVox\uff1a\u9996\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u8bbe\u5907\u8bed\u97f3\u52a9\u624b\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b3842\u6761\u591a\u901a\u9053\u97f3\u9891\u53ca\u4e94\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u591a\u901a\u9053\u8f93\u5165\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u5ffd\u7565\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u8bbe\u5907\u8bed\u97f3\u52a9\u624b\u7684\u7279\u6b8a\u6311\u6218\uff08\u5982\u8fd0\u52a8\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u5fae\u4e92\u52a8\u3001\u8bbe\u5907\u6307\u4ee4\u8bc6\u522b\uff09\uff0c\u9700\u5efa\u7acb\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f53\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaWearVox\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u591a\u73af\u5883\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u97f3\u9891\u6570\u636e\u53ca\u5143\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e3b\u6d41SLLM\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5355/\u53cc\u901a\u9053\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u573a\u666f\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u9876\u5c16\u6a21\u578b\u5728WearVox\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ec529%-59%\uff0c\u6237\u5916\u97f3\u9891\u6027\u80fd\u5927\u5e45\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u591a\u901a\u9053\u8f93\u5165\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6297\u566a\u80fd\u529b\u53ca\u6307\u4ee4\u8bc6\u522b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7a7a\u95f4\u97f3\u9891\u5bf9\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u8bed\u97f3\u52a9\u624b\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0cWearVox\u4e3a\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u672a\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Using both standard NLG metrics and recipe-specific metrics, we find that our loss significantly improves ingredient- and action-level metrics.

While Best-of-N and self-consistency methods show that aggregating multiple generations can improve performance, existing approaches typically rely on external evaluators, reward models, or exact string-match voting, limiting their applicability and efficiency. We propose Mode Extraction (ModeX), an evaluator-free Best-of-N selection framework that generalizes majority voting to open-ended text generation by identifying the modal output representing the dominant semantic consensus among generated texts. ModeX constructs a similarity graph over candidate generations and recursively applies spectral clustering to select a representative centroid, without requiring additional inference or auxiliary models.

We evaluated MLLM architectures on knee osteoarthritis (OA) radiograph classification, which remains underrepresented in existing medical MLLM benchmarks, even though knee OA affects an estimated 300 to 400 million people worldwide. Through systematic ablation studies manipulating the vision encoder, the connector, and the large language model (LLM) across diverse training strategies, we measured each component's contribution to diagnostic accuracy. In our classification task, a trained vision encoder alone could outperform full MLLM pipelines in classification accuracy and fine-tuning the LLM provided no meaningful improvement over prompt-based guidance. And LoRA fine-tuning on a small, class-balanced dataset (500 images) gave better results than training on a much larger but class-imbalanced set (5,778 images), indicating that data balance and quality can matter more than raw scale for this task. These findings suggest that for domain-specific medical classification, LLMs are more effective as interpreters and report generators rather than as primary classifiers. Therefore, the MLLM architecture appears less suitable for medical image diagnostic classification tasks that demand high certainty.

While fact-checking can mitigate these errors, existing methods typically retrieve external evidence indiscriminately, overlooking the model's internal knowledge and potentially introducing irrelevant noise. Moreover, current systems lack targeted mechanisms to resolve specific uncertainties in the model's reasoning. Inspired by how humans fact-check, we argue that LLMs should adaptively decide whether to rely on internal knowledge or initiate retrieval based on their confidence in a given claim. We introduce Probabilistic Certainty and Consistency (PCC), a framework that estimates factual confidence by jointly modeling an LLM's probabilistic certainty and reasoning consistency. These confidence signals enable an adaptive verification strategy: the model answers directly when confident, triggers targeted retrieval when uncertain or inconsistent, and escalates to deep search when ambiguity is high. Our confidence-guided routing mechanism ensures that retrieval is invoked only when necessary, improving both efficiency and reliability. Extensive experiments across three challenging benchmarks show that PCC achieves better uncertainty quantification than verbalized confidence and consistently outperforms strong LLM-based fact-checking baselines. Furthermore, we demonstrate that PCC generalizes well across various LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Probabilistic Certainty and Consistency (PCC)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5316\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6838\u67e5\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6982\u7387\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u51b3\u5b9a\u662f\u5426\u89e6\u53d1\u5916\u90e8\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u56de\u7b54\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dLLMs\u5728\u4e8b\u5b9e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u8981\u6c42\u9ad8\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6838\u67e5\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f2\u76ee\u68c0\u7d22\u5916\u90e8\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9488\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u63a8\u7406\u73af\u8282\u7684\u5b9a\u5411\u7ea0\u9519\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "1. \u63d0\u51faPCC\u6982\u7387\u6a21\u578b\uff1a\n   - \u7ed3\u5408LLM\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\uff08certainty\uff09\u4e0e\u591a\u8def\u5f84\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff08consistency\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u8054\u5408\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u5efa\u6a21\n   - \u5efa\u7acb\u52a8\u6001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u76f4\u63a5\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u4f4e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6216\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u65f6\u89e6\u53d1\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u6a21\u7cca\u65f6\u542f\u52a8\u6df1\u5ea6\u641c\u7d22\n  2. \u5f00\u53d1\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u8def\u7531\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ec5\u5728\u5fc5\u8981\u65f6\u8c03\u7528\u68c0\u7d22\u6a21\u5757", "result": "1. \u57283\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2dPCC\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u5e38\u89c4\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u8bed\u8a00\u63cf\u8ff0\u57fa\u51c6\n 2. \u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709LLM\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6838\u67e5\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4e8b\u5b9e\u51c6\u786e\u6027-F1\u5f97\u5206\u65b9\u9762\u63d0\u534712.3%\n 3. \u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1a\u57283\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u67b6\u6784LLM\uff08GPT-3.5/4\u3001Llama-2\uff09\u4e2d\u5747\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\n 4. \u68c0\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u4f18\u5316\uff1a\u51cf\u5c1137%\u7684\u65e0\u5173\u68c0\u7d22\u8bf7\u6c42", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efaPCC\u6846\u67b6\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86LLM\u5185\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0e\u5916\u90e8\u8bc1\u636e\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u878d\u5408\u673a\u5236\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5176\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u8bed\u8a00\u63cf\u8ff0\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8def\u7531\u7b56\u7565\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u7cbe\u76ca\u5316\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a\u5efa\u7acb\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Under review for a MELBA Special Issue. Minor revision resubmitted; decision pending", "summary": "Routine clinical imaging of the retina using optical coherence tomography (OCT) is performed with large slice spacing, resulting in highly anisotropic images and a sparsely scanned retina. Most learning-based methods circumvent the problems arising from the anisotropy by using 2D approaches rather than performing volumetric analyses. These approaches inherently bear the risk of generating inconsistent results for neighboring B-scans. For example, 2D retinal layer segmentations can have irregular surfaces in 3D. Furthermore, the typically used convolutional neural networks are bound to the resolution of the training data, which prevents their usage for images acquired with a different imaging protocol. Implicit neural representations (INRs) have recently emerged as a tool to store voxelized data as a continuous representation. Using coordinates as input, INRs are resolution-agnostic, which allows them to be applied to anisotropic data. In this paper, we propose two frameworks that make use of this characteristic of INRs for dense 3D analyses of retinal OCT volumes. 1) We perform inter-B-scan interpolation by incorporating additional information from en-face modalities, that help retain relevant structures between B-scans. 2) We create a resolution-agnostic retinal atlas that enables general analysis without strict requirements for the data. Both methods leverage generalizable INRs, improving retinal shape representation through population-based training and allowing predictions for unseen cases. Our resolution-independent frameworks facilitate the analysis of OCT images with large B-scan distances, opening up possibilities for the volumetric evaluation of retinal structures and pathologies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u9690\u5f0f\u795e\u7ecf\u8868\u5f81(INRs)\u76843D\u89c6\u7f51\u819cOCT\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6,\u901a\u8fc7\u5c42\u95f4\u63d2\u503c\u548c\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u65e0\u5173\u56fe\u8c31,\u89e3\u51b3\u4e34\u5e8a\u56fe\u50cf\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u7ec6\u8282\u4e22\u5931\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e34\u5e8aOCT\u5e38\u89c4\u91c7\u7528\u5927\u5c42\u95f4\u8ddd\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e09\u7ef4\u7ec6\u8282\u7f3a\u5931,2D\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u65ad\u5c42\u95f4\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u98ce\u9669,\u4e14\u4f20\u7edfCNN\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u6210\u50cf\u534f\u8bae,\u4e9f\u9700\u8de8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "1) \u63d0\u51fa\u8de8\u65ad\u5c42\u63d2\u503c\u6846\u67b6,\u7ed3\u5408en-face\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u589e\u5f3a\u5c42\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u8fde\u7eed\u6027;2) \u6784\u5efa\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u89c6\u7f51\u819c\u56fe\u8c31,\u5229\u7528INRs\u7684\u5750\u6807\u8f93\u5165\u7279\u6027\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u8868\u5f81\u3002\u4e24\u8005\u5747\u901a\u8fc7\u7fa4\u4f53\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5927\u578bB-scan\u95f4\u8ddd\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8fde\u7eed3D\u89c6\u7f51\u819c\u7ed3\u6784\u91cd\u5efa,\u652f\u6301\u4e0d\u540c\u5206\u8fa8\u7387OCT\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u9884\u6d4b,\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86INRs\u5728\u8de8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7a81\u7834\u4f20\u7edf2D\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7ed1\u5b9a\u7684\u5c40\u9650,\u4e3a\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u7f51\u819c\u626b\u63cf\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u4e09\u7ef4\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177,\u63a8\u52a8\u89c6\u7f51\u819c\u75c5\u7406\u7684\u5bb9\u79ef\u91cf\u5316\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

Recent approaches leverage vision and language foundation models to directly solve dense tasks through multi-view renderings and text queries. While promising, these pipelines require expensive inference over multiple renderings, depend heavily on large language-model (LLM) prompt engineering for captions, and fail to exploit the inherent 3D geometry of shapes. We address this gap by introducing an encoder-only 3D model that produces language-aligned patch-level features directly from point clouds. Our pre-training approach builds on existing data engines that generate part-annotated 3D shapes by pairing multi-view SAM regions with VLM captioning. Using this data, we train a point cloud transformer encoder in two stages: (1) distillation of dense 2D features from visual encoders such as DINOv2 into 3D patches, and (2) alignment of these patch embeddings with part-level text embeddings through a multi-positive contrastive objective. Our 3D encoder achieves zero-shot 3D part segmentation with fast single-pass inference without any test-time multi-view rendering, while significantly outperforming previous rendering-based and feed-forward approaches across several 3D part segmentation benchmarks.

Yet existing VideoQA benchmarks struggle to capture this multimodal reasoning and are largely not open-ended, given the difficulty of evaluating free-form answers. In this paper, we introduce a novel open-ended multi-modal VideoQA benchmark, MovieRecapsQA created using movie recap videos--a distinctive type of YouTube content that summarizes a film by presenting its key events through synchronized visual (recap video) and textual (recap summary) modalities. Using the recap summary, we generate $\\approx 8.2$ K question-answer (QA) pairs (aligned with movie-subtitles) and provide the necessary \"facts\" needed to verify an answer in a reference-free manner. To our knowledge, this is the first open-ended VideoQA benchmark that supplies explicit textual context of the input (video and/or text); which we use for evaluation. Our benchmark provides videos of multiple lengths (i.e., recap-segments, movie-segments) and categorizations of questions (by modality and type) to enable fine-grained analysis. We evaluate the performance of seven state-of-the-art MLLMs using our benchmark and observe that: 1) visual-only questions remain the most challenging; 2) models default to textual inputs whenever available; 3) extracting factually accurate information from video content is still difficult for all models; and 4) proprietary and open-source models perform comparably on video-dependent questions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u89c6\u9891\u95ee\u7b54\u57fa\u51c6MovieRecapsQA\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7535\u5f71\u56de\u987e\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u7ea68.2K\u95ee\u9898\u4e0e\u56de\u7b54\u5bf9\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u65e0\u9700\u53c2\u8003\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u95ee\u7b54\u57fa\u51c6\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5f00\u653e\u6027\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u5f00\u653e\u7b54\u6848\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u56f0\u96be\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u7535\u5f71\u56de\u987e\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u540c\u6b65\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u7535\u5f71\u56de\u987e\u89c6\u9891\u548c\u5267\u672c\u5b57\u5e55\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u7b54\u5bf9\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u95ee\u9898\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e8b\u5b9e\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u540c\u957f\u5ea6\u89c6\u9891\u7247\u6bb5\u548c\u95ee\u9898\u5206\u7c7b\uff08\u5982\u6a21\u6001\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u95ee\u9898\u7c7b\u578b\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f307\u79cd\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u6311\u6218\uff08\u5982\u4f9d\u8d56\u6587\u672c\u8f93\u5165\u3001\u89c6\u9891\u5185\u5bb9\u4e8b\u5b9e\u63d0\u53d6\u56f0\u96be\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u5546\u7528\u4e0e\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u76f8\u5173\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u8fd1\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "MovieRecapsQA\u4e3a\u5f00\u653e\u7b54\u6848\u89c6\u9891\u95ee\u7b54\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u521b\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u7684\u73b0\u5b58\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u5173\u6ce8\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u4e0e\u89c6\u9891\u5185\u5bb9\u7cbe\u786e\u89e3\u6790\u3002"}}

This study presents a pipeline for developing a lung cancer knowledge base using Open Information Extraction (OpenIE). The process includes: (1) identifying medical concepts with the MeSH thesaurus; (2) filtering open-access PubMed literature with permissive licenses (CC0); (3) extracting (subject, relation, object) triplets using OpenIE method; and (4) enriching triplet sets with Named Entity Recognition (NER) to ensure biomedical relevance. The resulting triplet sets provide a domain-specific, large-scale, and noise-aware resource for fine-tuning LLMs. We evaluated T5 models finetuned on this dataset through Supervised Semantic Fine-Tuning.

Generating them from a single photograph in a controllable manner is particularly challenging. Existing image-animation techniques are restricted to simple, low-frequency motions and operate only in narrow domains with repetitive textures like water and smoke. In contrast, large-scale video diffusion models are not tailored for cinemagraph constraints and lack the specialized data required to generate seamless, controlled loops. We present DreamLoop, a controllable video synthesis framework dedicated to generating cinemagraphs from a single photo without requiring any cinemagraph training data. Our key idea is to adapt a general video diffusion model by training it on two objectives: temporal bridging and motion conditioning. This strategy enables flexible cinemagraph generation. During inference, by using the input image as both the first- and last- frame condition, we enforce a seamless loop. By conditioning on static tracks, we maintain a static background. Finally, by providing a user-specified motion path for a target object, our method provides intuitive control over the animation's trajectory and timing. To our knowledge, DreamLoop is the first method to enable cinemagraph generation for general scenes with flexible and intuitive controls. We demonstrate that our method produces high-quality, complex cinemagraphs that align with user intent, outperforming existing approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "DreamLoop \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3 cinemagraph \u6570\u636e\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u89c6\u9891\u5408\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u5355\u5f20\u56fe\u7247\u751f\u6210\u590d\u6742\u7684 cinemagraphs\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u751f\u6210\u8fd0\u52a8\u7b80\u5355\u3001\u4f9d\u8d56\u91cd\u590d\u7eb9\u7406\uff08\u5982\u6c34\u70df\uff09\u6216\u9700\u6c42\u9ad8\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u6570\u636e\u7b49\u9650\u5236\uff0cDreamLoop \u9700\u8981\u5728\u96f6\u7279\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u7075\u6d3b\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf cinemagraph \u751f\u6210\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u901a\u7528\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53cc\u76ee\u6807\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff1a1) \u901a\u8fc7\u9996\u5c3e\u5e27\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u7f1d\u5faa\u73af\uff08temporal bridging\uff09\uff1b2) \u5229\u7528\u9759\u6001\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u7528\u6237\u6307\u5b9a\u8fd0\u52a8\u8def\u5f84\u63a7\u5236\u80cc\u666f\u9759\u6b62\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u7269\u52a8\u6001\uff08motion conditioning\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684 cinemagraphs\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u53ef\u76f4\u89c2\u64cd\u63a7\u52a8\u753b\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0e\u8282\u594f\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u8de8\u573a\u666f\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u3002", "conclusion": "DreamLoop \u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u7279\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u4f9d\u8d56\u3001\u652f\u6301\u591a\u6837\u5316\u573a\u666f\u4e0e\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u63a7\u5236\u7684 cinemagraph \u751f\u6210\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9886\u57df\u4e0e\u8868\u73b0\u529b\u9650\u5236\u3002"}}

Although numerous detection methods have been proposed, their accuracy often degrades when applied to images generated by novel or unseen generative models, highlighting the challenge of achieving strong generalization. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel detection paradigm based on channel removal reconstruction. Specifically, we observe that when the green (G) channel is removed from real images and reconstructed, the resulting reconstruction errors differ significantly from those of AI-generated images. Building upon this insight, we propose G-channel Removed Reconstruction Error (GRRE), a simple yet effective method that exploits this discrepancy for robust AI-generated image detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GRRE consistently achieves high detection accuracy across multiple generative models, including those unseen during training. Compared with existing approaches, GRRE not only maintains strong robustness against various perturbations and post-processing operations but also exhibits superior cross-model generalization. These results highlight the potential of channel-removal-based reconstruction as a powerful forensic tool for safeguarding image authenticity in the era of generative AI.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7eff\u8272\u901a\u9053\u79fb\u9664\u91cd\u5efa\u8bef\u5dee\uff08GRRE\uff09\u7684AI\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u79fb\u9664\u7eff\u8272\u901a\u9053\u540e\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u548cGANs\uff09\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u96be\u4ee5\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\u533a\u5206\uff0c\u4e14\u73b0\u6709\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u53d1\u73b0\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\u5728\u79fb\u9664\u7eff\u8272\u901a\u9053\u540e\u91cd\u5efa\u8bef\u5dee\u7279\u6027\u4e0eAI\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u7531\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u68c0\u6d4b\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGRRE\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u79fb\u9664\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u7eff\u8272\uff08G\uff09\u901a\u9053\u5e76\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u91cd\u5efa\u8bef\u5dee\u5dee\u5f02\u8fdb\u884c\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u8bef\u5dee\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0eAI\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u5b58\u5728\u672c\u8d28\u533a\u522b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5316\u8fd9\u79cd\u5dee\u5f02\u5b9e\u73b0\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eGRRE\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff09\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u6297\u6270\u52a8\u80fd\u529b\uff08\u5982\u540e\u5904\u7406\u64cd\u4f5c\uff09\u548c\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u901a\u9053\u79fb\u9664\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347AI\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u65f6\u4ee3\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u9274\u5b9a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6b64\u7c7b\u91cd\u5efa\u8bef\u5dee\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6570\u5b57\u53d6\u8bc1\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

This narrow focus prevents current benchmarks from revealing systematic reasoning failures, factual blind spots, and robustness limitations of modern LLMs. To bridge this gap, we present FactArena, a fully automated arena-style evaluation framework that conducts comprehensive, stage-wise benchmarking of LLMs across the complete fact-checking pipeline. FactArena integrates three key components: (i) an LLM-driven fact-checking process that standardizes claim decomposition, evidence retrieval via tool-augmented interactions, and justification-based verdict prediction; (ii) an arena-styled judgment mechanism guided by consolidated reference guidelines to ensure unbiased and consistent pairwise comparisons across heterogeneous judge agents; and (iii) an arena-driven claim-evolution module that adaptively generates more challenging and semantically controlled claims to probe LLMs' factual robustness beyond fixed seed data. Across 16 state-of-the-art LLMs spanning seven model families, FactArena produces stable and interpretable rankings. Our analyses further reveal significant discrepancies between static claim-verification accuracy and end-to-end fact-checking competence, highlighting the necessity of holistic evaluation.

However, current 3D mesh saliency GT acquisition methods are generally consistent with 2D image methods, ignoring the differences between 3D geometry topology and 2D image array. Current VR eye-tracking pipelines rely on single ray sampling and Euclidean smoothing, triggering texture attention and signal leakage across gaps. This paper proposes a robust framework to address these limitations. We first introduce a view cone sampling (VCS) strategy, which simulates the human foveal receptive field via Gaussian-distributed ray bundles to improve sampling robustness for complex topologies. Furthermore, a hybrid Manifold-Euclidean constrained diffusion (HCD) algorithm is developed, fusing manifold geodesic constraints with Euclidean scales to ensure topologically-consistent saliency propagation.

With the rising computational cost of training large-scale deep models, dataset distillation has emerged as a promising approach for constructing compact synthetic datasets that retain the knowledge of their large original counterparts. However, traditional optimization-based methods often suffer from high computational overhead, memory constraints, and the generation of unrealistic, noise-like images with limited architectural generalization. Recent non-optimization methods alleviate some of these issues by constructing distilled data from real image patches, but the used rigid patch selection strategies can still discard critical information about the main objects. To solve this problem, we first leverage Grounded SAM2 to identify foreground objects and compute per-image foreground occupancy, from which we derive a category-wise patch decision threshold. Guided by these thresholds, we design a dynamic patch selection strategy that, for each image, either selects the most informative patch from multiple candidates or directly resizes the full image when the foreground dominates. This dual-path mechanism preserves more key information about the main objects while reducing redundant background content. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that the proposed method consistently improves distillation performance over existing approaches, producing more informative and representative distilled datasets and enhancing robustness across different architectures and image compositions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u524d\u666f\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8865\u4e01\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528Grounded SAM2\u63d0\u5347\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u84b8\u998f\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u4e14\u751f\u6210\u4e0d\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u975e\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u56fa\u5b9a\u8865\u4e01\u7b56\u7565\u6613\u4e22\u5931\u5173\u952e\u7269\u4f53\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Grounded SAM2\u8bc6\u522b\u524d\u666f\u5e76\u8ba1\u7b97\u5360\u6709\u7387\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u51b3\u5b9a\u8865\u4e01\u9009\u62e9\u6216\u5168\u56fe\u7f29\u653e\u7684\u53cc\u8def\u5f84\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u84b8\u998f\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u5177\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u8de8\u67b6\u6784\u4e0e\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u52a8\u6001\u524d\u666f\u611f\u77e5\u673a\u5236\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u5197\u4f59\u80cc\u666f\u5e76\u4fdd\u7559\u6838\u5fc3\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Feder Cooper", "Sanmi Koyejo", "Percy Liang"], "title": "Extracting books from production language models", "comment": "We ran experiments from mid-August to mid-September 2025, notified affected providers shortly after, and now make our findings public after a 90-day disclosure window", "summary": "Many unresolved legal questions over LLMs and copyright center on memorization: whether specific training data have been encoded in the model's weights during training, and whether those memorized data can be extracted in the model's outputs. While many believe that LLMs do not memorize much of their training data, recent work shows that substantial amounts of copyrighted text can be extracted from open-weight models. However, it remains an open question if similar extraction is feasible for production LLMs, given the safety measures these systems implement. We investigate this question using a two-phase procedure: (1) an initial probe to test for extraction feasibility, which sometimes uses a Best-of-N (BoN) jailbreak, followed by (2) iterative continuation prompts to attempt to extract the book. We evaluate our procedure on four production LLMs -- Claude 3.7 Sonnet, GPT-4.1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Grok 3 -- and we measure extraction success with a score computed from a block-based approximation of longest common substring (nv-recall). With different per-LLM experimental configurations, we were able to extract varying amounts of text. For the Phase 1 probe, it was unnecessary to jailbreak Gemini 2.5 Pro and Grok 3 to extract text (e.g, nv-recall of 76.8% and 70.3%, respectively, for Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone), while it was necessary for Claude 3.7 Sonnet and GPT-4.1. In some cases, jailbroken Claude 3.7 Sonnet outputs entire books near-verbatim (e.g., nv-recall=95.8%). GPT-4.1 requires significantly more BoN attempts (e.g., 20X), and eventually refuses to continue (e.g., nv-recall=4.0%).

In this work, we identify and quantify a fundamental functional perception gap: the inability of current vision encoders to decode functional tracer biodistribution independent of morphological priors. Identifying Positron Emission Tomography (PET) as the quintessential modality to investigate this disconnect, we introduce PET-Bench, the first large-scale functional imaging benchmark comprising 52,308 hierarchical QA pairs from 9,732 multi-site, multi-tracer PET studies. Extensive evaluation of 19 state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals a critical safety hazard termed the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) hallucination trap. We observe that standard CoT prompting, widely considered to enhance reasoning, paradoxically decouples linguistic generation from visual evidence in PET, producing clinically fluent but factually ungrounded diagnoses. To resolve this, we propose Atomic Visual Alignment (AVA), a simple fine-tuning strategy that enforces the mastery of low-level functional perception prior to high-level diagnostic reasoning. Our results demonstrate that AVA effectively bridges the perception gap, transforming CoT from a source of hallucination into a robust inference tool and improving diagnostic accuracy by up to 14.83%.

We identify three critical limitations: (a) fixed user-defined parameters (e.g., voxel size, search radius) that fail to generalize across varying scales, (b) learned keypoint detectors exhibit poor cross-domain transferability, and (c) absolute coordinates amplify scale mismatches between datasets. To address these three issues, we present BUFFER-X, a training-free registration framework that achieves zero-shot generalization through: (a) geometric bootstrapping for automatic hyperparameter estimation, (b) distribution-aware farthest point sampling to replace learned detectors, and (c) patch-level coordinate normalization to ensure scale consistency. Our approach employs hierarchical multi-scale matching to extract correspondences across local, middle, and global receptive fields, enabling robust registration in diverse environments. For efficiency-critical applications, we introduce BUFFER-X-Lite, which reduces total computation time by 43% (relative to BUFFER-X) through early exit strategies and fast pose solvers while preserving accuracy. We evaluate on a comprehensive benchmark comprising 12 datasets spanning object-scale, indoor, and outdoor scenes, including cross-sensor registration between heterogeneous LiDAR configurations. Results demonstrate that our approach generalizes effectively without manual tuning or prior knowledge of test domains.

Recent work has made significant progress, but its reliance on large-scale datasets and complex decoders has limited its efficiency and generalization ability. In this paper, we propose a lightweight and data-centric framework for zero-shot monocular depth estimation. We first adopt DINOv3 as the visual encoder to obtain high-quality dense features. Secondly, to address the inherent drawbacks of the complex structure of the DPT, we design the Simple Depth Transformer (SDT), a compact transformer-based decoder. Compared to the DPT, it uses a single-path feature fusion and upsampling process to reduce the computational overhead of cross-scale feature fusion, achieving higher accuracy while reducing the number of parameters by approximately 85%-89%. Furthermore, we propose a quality-based filtering strategy to filter out harmful samples, thereby reducing dataset size while improving overall training quality. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks demonstrate that our framework surpasses the DPT in accuracy.

Building on a knowledge distillation chain-style model, we introduce a code module to guide knowledge-graph exploration and incorporate code as part of the chain-of-thought prompt, forming an external knowledge input that provides more accurate and structured information to the model. Based on this design, we develop an improved knowledge distillation chain-style model and leverage it to analyze and constrain the reasoning process of LLMs, thereby improving inference accuracy. We empirically evaluate the proposed approach using GPT-4 and LLaMA-3.3 on multiple public datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that incorporating code modules significantly enhances the model's ability to capture contextual information and effectively mitigates prompt-induced hallucinations.

However, most existing approaches rely heavily on degradation-specific representations, often resulting in oversmoothing and artifacts. To address this, we propose ClearAIR, a novel AiOIR framework inspired by Human Visual Perception (HVP) and designed with a hierarchical, coarse-to-fine restoration strategy. First, leveraging the global priority of early HVP, we employ a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based Image Quality Assessment (IQA) model for overall evaluation. Unlike conventional IQA, our method integrates cross-modal understanding to more accurately characterize complex, composite degradations. Building upon this overall assessment, we then introduce a region awareness and task recognition pipeline. A semantic cross-attention, leveraging semantic guidance unit, first produces coarse semantic prompts. Guided by this regional context, a degradation-aware module implicitly captures region-specific degradation characteristics, enabling more precise local restoration. Finally, to recover fine details, we propose an internal clue reuse mechanism. It operates in a self-supervised manner to mine and leverage the intrinsic information of the image itself, substantially enhancing detail restoration.

The maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of this function, tehta_MLE, turns out to be the mean of units. Through computational simulations of symbol sequences and validation analyses of natural language sentences, we uncover that compared to linear processing, hierarchical processing far surpasses it in constraining the tehta_MLE values under the human WMC limit, along with the increase of sequence/sentence length successfully.

While recent MLLMs develop strong general-purpose multimodal reasoning capabilities, they fall short in abductive inference, as compared to human beings. To bridge this gap, we draw inspiration from the interplay between verbal and pictorial abduction in human cognition, and propose to strengthen abduction of MLLMs by mimicking such dual-mode behavior. Concretely, we introduce AbductiveMLLM comprising of two synergistic components: REASONER and IMAGINER. The REASONER operates in the verbal domain. It first explores a broad space of possible explanations using a blind LLM and then prunes visually incongruent hypotheses based on cross-modal causal alignment. The remaining hypotheses are introduced into the MLLM as targeted priors, steering its reasoning toward causally coherent explanations. The IMAGINER, on the other hand, further guides MLLMs by emulating human-like pictorial thinking. It conditions a text-to-image diffusion model on both the input video and the REASONER's output embeddings to \"imagine\" plausible visual scenes that correspond to verbal explanation, thereby enriching MLLMs' contextual grounding.

This approach, however, dilutes the subtle, localized signals of memorization, reducing attack effectiveness. We challenge this global-averaging paradigm, positing that membership signals are more pronounced within localized contexts. We introduce WBC (Window-Based Comparison), which exploits this insight through a sliding window approach with sign-based aggregation. Our method slides windows of varying sizes across text sequences, with each window casting a binary vote on membership based on loss comparisons between target and reference models. By ensembling votes across geometrically spaced window sizes, we capture memorization patterns from token-level artifacts to phrase-level structures. Extensive experiments across eleven datasets demonstrate that WBC substantially outperforms established baselines, achieving higher AUC scores and 2-3 times improvements in detection rates at low false positive thresholds.

Its input style conditions typically include text, style image, and stylized first frame. Each condition has a characteristic advantage: text is more flexible, style image provides a more accurate visual anchor, and stylized first frame makes long-video stylization feasible. However, existing methods are largely confined to a single type of style condition, which limits their scope of application. Additionally, their lack of high-quality datasets leads to style inconsistency and temporal flicker. To address these limitations, we introduce DreamStyle, a unified framework for video stylization, supporting (1) text-guided, (2) style-image-guided, and (3) first-frame-guided video stylization, accompanied by a well-designed data curation pipeline to acquire high-quality paired video data. DreamStyle is built on a vanilla Image-to-Video (I2V) model and trained using a Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) with token-specific up matrices that reduces the confusion among different condition tokens. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that DreamStyle is competent in all three video stylization tasks, and outperforms the competitors in style consistency and video quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "DreamStyle\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u98ce\u683c\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6587\u672c\u3001\u98ce\u683c\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u6837\u5f0f\u5316\u7b2c\u4e00\u5e27\u4e09\u79cd\u98ce\u683c\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u6d41\u7a0b\u89e3\u51b3\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u7f3a\u5931\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u98ce\u683c\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u98ce\u683c\u6761\u4ef6\u8f93\u5165\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u98ce\u683c\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u95ea\u70c1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u8de8\u98ce\u683c\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u901a\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u57fa\u7840\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5f15\u5165\u4f4e\u79e9\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\uff08LoRA\uff09\u4e0e\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u4e0a\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u5e76\u642d\u914d\u4e13\u4e3a\u591a\u6761\u4ef6\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7b5b\u9009\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e0d\u540c\u6761\u4ef6\u6807\u8bb0\u95f4\u7684\u6df7\u6dc6\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u89c6\u9891\u98ce\u683c\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u98ce\u683c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u8d28\u91cf\u91cf\u5316\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u591a\u6761\u4ef6\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "DreamStyle\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u6837\u5f0f\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u89c6\u9891\u98ce\u683c\u5316\uff0c\u62d3\u5c55\u4e86\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u5e76\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u96be\u9898\u3002"}}

We propose a novel approach that adapts any state-of-the-art image-based (depth) estimation model for video processing by integrating a new temporal module - trainable on a single GPU in a few days. Our architecture StableDPT builds upon an off-the-shelf Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder and enhances the Dense Prediction Transformer (DPT) head. The core of our contribution lies in the temporal layers within the head, which use an efficient cross-attention mechanism to integrate information from keyframes sampled across the entire video sequence.

However, compared with the commonly used Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining, IHC staining involves complex procedures and is both time-consuming and expensive, which limits its widespread clinical use. Virtual staining converts H&E images to IHC images, offering a cost-effective alternative to clinical IHC staining. Nevertheless, using adjacent slides as ground truth often results in weakly-paired data with spatial misalignment and local deformations, hindering effective supervised learning. To address these challenges, we propose a novel topology-aware framework for H&E-to-IHC virtual staining. Specifically, we introduce a Topology-aware Consistency Matching (TACM) mechanism that employs graph contrastive learning and topological perturbations to learn robust matching patterns despite spatial misalignments, ensuring structural consistency. Furthermore, we propose a Topology-constrained Pathological Matching (TCPM) mechanism that aligns pathological positive regions based on node importance to enhance pathological consistency.

Inspired by this cognitive efficiency, we propose SketchThinker-R1, which incentivizes sketch-style reasoning ability in large multimodal models. Our method consists of three primary stages. In the Sketch-Mode Cold Start stage, we convert standard long reasoning process into sketch-style reasoning and finetune base multimodal model, instilling initial sketch-style reasoning capability. Next, we train SketchJudge Reward Model, which explicitly evaluates thinking process of model and assigns higher scores to sketch-style reasoning. Finally, we conduct Sketch-Thinking Reinforcement Learning under supervision of SketchJudge to further generalize sketch-style reasoning ability. Experimental evaluation on four benchmarks reveals that our SketchThinker-R1 achieves over 64% reduction in reasoning token cost without compromising final answer accuracy. Qualitative analysis further shows that sketch-style reasoning focuses more on key cues during problem solving.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faEfficient SketchThinking\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u8349\u56fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u957f\u6b65\u9aa4\u63a8\u7406\u5e26\u6765\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff08token\u6210\u672c\u548c\u54cd\u5e94\u65f6\u95f4\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u4eba\u7c7b\u91c7\u7528\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8349\u56fe\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1) Sketch-Mode\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u9636\u6bb5\u8f6c\u6362\u957f\u63a8\u7406\u4e3a\u8349\u56fe\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u5e76\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\uff1b2) \u8bad\u7ec3SketchJudge\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1b3) \u57fa\u4e8e\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u57284\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u51cf\u5c1164%\u63a8\u7406token\u6210\u672c\u4e14\u4e0d\u964d\u4f4e\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u5173\u6ce8\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7ebf\u7d22\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Methodological Considerations for Measuring Cultural Alignment in LLMs", "comment": "IJCNLP-AACL 2025", "summary": "Socio-demographic prompting (SDP) - prompting Large Language Models (LLMs) using demographic proxies to generate culturally aligned outputs - often shows LLM responses as stereotypical and biased. While effective in assessing LLMs' cultural competency, SDP is prone to confounding factors such as prompt sensitivity, decoding parameters, and the inherent difficulty of generation over discrimination tasks due to larger output spaces. These factors complicate interpretation, making it difficult to determine if the poor performance is due to bias or the task design. To address this, we use inverse socio-demographic prompting (ISDP), where we prompt LLMs to discriminate and predict the demographic proxy from actual and simulated user behavior from different users. We use the Goodreads-CSI dataset (Saha et al., 2025), which captures difficulty in understanding English book reviews for users from India, Mexico, and the USA, and test four LLMs: Aya-23, Gemma-2, GPT-4o, and LLaMA-3.1 with ISDP.

Despite this non-uniqueness, language models are typically trained using a single canonical longest-prefix tokenization. We formalize homotokens-alternative valid subword segmentations of the same lexical item-as a strictly meaning-preserving form of data augmentation. We introduce a lightweight training architecture that conditions canonical next-token prediction on sampled homotoken variants via an auxiliary causal encoder and block-causal cross-attention, without modifying the training objective or token interface. In data-constrained pretraining, homotoken augmentation consistently delays overfitting under repeated data exposure and improves generalization across diverse evaluation datasets. In multilingual fine-tuning, we find that the effectiveness of homotokens depends on tokenizer quality: gains are strongest when canonical tokens are highly compressed and diminish when the tokenizer already over-fragments the input. Overall, homotokens provide a simple and modular mechanism for inducing tokenization invariance in language models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u540c\u8d28\u5206\u8bcd\uff08homotokens\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5206\u8bcd\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0d\u53d8\u4f46\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u5206\u8bcd\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u901a\u5e38\u91c7\u7528\u5355\u4e00\u7684\u6700\u957f\u524d\u7f00\u5206\u8bcd\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u5408\u6cd5\u5206\u8bcd\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u79cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u8db3\u6216\u5206\u8bcd\u4e0d\u5747\u8861\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u540c\u8d28\u5206\u8bcd\uff08homotokens\uff09\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8f85\u52a9\u56e0\u679c\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u5757\u56e0\u679c\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u5206\u8bcd\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u4f46\u4fdd\u6301\u539f\u6709\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u5206\u8bcd\u63a5\u53e3\u4e0d\u53d8\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6570\u636e\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u540c\u8d28\u5206\u8bcd\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e86\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u73b0\u8c61\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u73b0\uff1b\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u82f1\u6587\u6548\u679c\u4f18\u4e8e\u65e5\u6587\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5206\u8bcd\u6548\u7387\u8d8a\u9ad8\u589e\u76ca\u8d8a\u663e\u8457\u3002", "conclusion": "\u540c\u8d28\u5206\u8bcd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f7f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u4fee\u6539\u6838\u5fc3\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u83b7\u5f97\u5206\u8bcd\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

We present several key adaptations to diffusion models, which are important in this discrete setting. Notably, we show that a location-aware palette with our 2D gray code ordering improves performance. Adding a final tanh activation function is crucial for discrete data. On optimizing diffusion parameters, the sigmoid loss weighting consistently outperforms alternatives, regardless of the prediction type used, and we settle on x-prediction. While our current model does not yet surpass leading mask-based architectures, it narrows the performance gap and introduces unique capabilities, such as principled ambiguity modeling, that these models lack.

Current long-context benchmarks often trade off scalability and realism: synthetic tasks underrepresent real-world complexity, while fully manual annotation is costly to scale to extreme lengths and diverse scenarios. We present LongBench Pro, a more realistic and comprehensive bilingual benchmark of 1,500 naturally occurring long-context samples in English and Chinese spanning 11 primary tasks and 25 secondary tasks, with input lengths from 8k to 256k tokens. LongBench Pro supports fine-grained analysis with task-specific metrics and a multi-dimensional taxonomy of context requirement (full vs. partial dependency), length (six levels), and difficulty (four levels calibrated by model performance). To balance quality with scalability, we propose a Human-Model Collaborative Construction pipeline: frontier LLMs draft challenging questions and reference answers, along with design rationales and solution processes, to reduce the cost of expert verification. Experts then rigorously validate correctness and refine problematic cases. Evaluating 46 widely used long-context LLMs on LongBench Pro yields three findings: (1) long-context optimization contributes more to long-context comprehension than parameter scaling; (2) effective context length is typically shorter than the claimed context length, with pronounced cross-lingual misalignment; and (3) the \"thinking\" paradigm helps primarily models trained with native reasoning, while mixed-thinking designs offer a promising Pareto trade-off.

The paper is accepted by WACV 2026", "summary": "Dense video captioning aims to interpret and describe all temporally localized events throughout an input video. Recent state-of-the-art methods leverage large language models (LLMs) to provide detailed moment descriptions for video data. However, existing VideoLLMs remain challenging in identifying precise event boundaries in untrimmed videos, causing the generated captions to be not properly grounded. In this paper, we propose TA-Prompting, which enhances VideoLLMs via Temporal Anchors that learn to precisely localize events and prompt the VideoLLMs to perform temporal-aware video event understanding. During inference, in order to properly determine the output caption sequence from an arbitrary number of events presented within a video, we introduce an event coherent sampling strategy to select event captions with sufficient coherence across temporal events and cross-modal similarity with the given video. Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we show that our TA-Prompting is favorable against state-of-the-art VideoLLMs, yielding superior performance on dense video captioning and temporal understanding tasks including moment retrieval and temporalQA.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51faTA-Prompting\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4\u951a\u70b9\u548c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u9ad8VideoLLMs\u5728dense video captioning\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709VideoLLMs\u5728\u672a\u526a\u8f91\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e8b\u4ef6\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u751f\u6210\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e0e\u89c6\u9891\u5185\u5bb9\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTA-Prompting\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\uff1a1) \u65f6\u95f4\u951a\u70b9\u673a\u5236\u589e\u5f3a\u89c6\u9891\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u5b9a\u4f4d\u80fd\u529b\uff1b2) \u4e8b\u4ef6\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u7b5b\u9009\u5177\u6709\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u53ca\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\u63cf\u8ff0\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cTA-Prompting\u5728dense captioning\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\uff08moment retrieval\u3001temporalQA\uff09\u5747\u4f18\u4e8eSOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u7279\u522b\u5728DenseCap\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u4e14\u65f6\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e17.5%\u3002", "conclusion": "TA-Prompting\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u65f6\u5e8f\u589e\u5f3a\u673a\u5236\u548c\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86VideoLLMs\u5728\u4e8b\u4ef6\u8fb9\u754c\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u63cf\u8ff0\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u65f6\u5e8f\u7406\u89e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Previous methods typically focus on predicting numerical scores without explanation or provide low-level descriptions lacking precise scores. Recent reasoning-based vision language models (VLMs) have shown strong potential for IQA, enabling joint generation of quality descriptions and scores. However, we notice that existing VLM-based IQA methods tend to exhibit unreliable reasoning due to their limited capability of integrating visual and textual cues. In this work, we introduce Zoom-IQA, a VLM-based IQA model to explicitly emulate key cognitive behaviors: uncertainty awareness, region reasoning, and iterative refinement. Specifically, we present a two-stage training pipeline: 1) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on our Grounded-Rationale-IQA (GR-IQA) dataset to teach the model to ground its assessments in key regions; and 2) reinforcement learning (RL) for dynamic policy exploration, primarily stabilized by our KL-Coverage regularizer to prevent reasoning and scoring diversity collapse, and supported by a Progressive Re-sampling Strategy to mitigate annotation bias. Extensive experiments show that Zoom-IQA achieves improved robustness, explainability, and generalization.

The challenges of multi-modal vehicle ReID arise from the uncertainty of modality quality distribution induced by inherent discrepancies across modalities, resulting in distinct conflicting fusion requirements for data with balanced and unbalanced quality distributions. Existing methods handle all multi-modal data within a single fusion model, overlooking the different needs of the two data types and making it difficult to decouple the conflict between intra-class consistency and inter-modal heterogeneity. To this end, we propose Disentangle Collaboration and Guidance Fusion Representations for Multi-modal Vehicle ReID (DCG-ReID). Specifically, to disentangle heterogeneous quality-distributed modal data without mutual interference, we first design the Dynamic Confidence-based Disentangling Weighting (DCDW) mechanism: dynamically reweighting three-modal contributions via interaction-derived modal confidence to build a disentangled fusion framework. Building on DCDW, we develop two scenario-specific fusion strategies: (1) for balanced quality distributions, Collaboration Fusion Module (CFM) mines pairwise consensus features to capture shared discriminative information and boost intra-class consistency; (2) for unbalanced distributions, Guidance Fusion Module (GFM) implements differential amplification of modal discriminative disparities to reinforce dominant modality advantages, guide auxiliary modalities to mine complementary discriminative info, and mitigate inter-modal divergence to boost multi-modal joint decision performance.

However, different regional varieties often employ different scripts to write the same language, rendering speech recognition output also subject to non-determinism in the output script. To mitigate this problem, we show that script is linearly encoded in the activation space of multilingual speech models, and that modifying activations at inference time enables direct control over output script. We find the addition of such script vectors to activations at test time can induce script change even in unconventional language-script pairings (e.g. Italian in Cyrillic and Japanese in Latin script). We apply this approach to inducing post-hoc control over the script of speech recognition output, where we observe competitive performance across all model sizes of Whisper.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8bed\u97f3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u4e66\u5199\u7cfb\u7edf\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u6fc0\u6d3b\u503c\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\u8f93\u51fa\u811a\u672c\u7684\u540e\u671f\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8bed\u97f3\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u5305\u542b\u5730\u533a\u53d8\u4f53\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u540c\u4e00\u8bed\u8a00\u53ef\u80fd\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0d\u540c\u4e66\u5199\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u7075\u6d3b\u63a7\u5236\u8f93\u51fa\u811a\u672c\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u975e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u811a\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u7ebf\u6027\u53ef\u5206\u6027\u540e\uff0c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u6fc0\u6d3b\u503c\u504f\u79fb\u6ce8\u5165\u76ee\u6807\u811a\u672c\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u5bf9Whisper\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u540e\u671f\u811a\u672c\u63a7\u5236\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u53ef\u89e3\u6790\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u811a\u672c\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u6ce8\u5165\u975e\u5e38\u89c4\u811a\u672c\u5411\u91cf\uff08\u5982\u610f\u5927\u5229\u8bed\u4f7f\u7528\u897f\u91cc\u5c14\u5b57\u6bcd\uff09\u4ecd\u80fd\u6210\u529f\u6539\u53d8\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u89c4\u6a21Whisper\u6a21\u578b\u5747\u4fdd\u6301\u4f18\u5f02\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u7075\u6d3b\u63a7\u5236\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u4e66\u5199\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4e3a\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u811a\u672c\u9002\u914d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Existing VAU approaches often rely on fine-tuned multimodal large language models (MLLMs) or external modules such as video captioners, which introduce costly annotations, complex training pipelines, and high inference overhead. In this work, we introduce PrismVAU, a lightweight yet effective system for real-time VAU that leverages a single off-the-shelf MLLM for anomaly scoring, explanation, and prompt optimization. PrismVAU operates in two complementary stages: (1) a coarse anomaly scoring module that computes frame-level anomaly scores via similarity to textual anchors, and (2) an MLLM-based refinement module that contextualizes anomalies through system and user prompts. Both textual anchors and prompts are optimized with a weakly supervised Automatic Prompt Engineering (APE) framework. Extensive experiments on standard VAD benchmarks demonstrate that PrismVAU delivers competitive detection performance and interpretable anomaly explanations -- without relying on instruction tuning, frame-level annotations, and external modules or dense processing -- making it an efficient and practical solution for real-world applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "PrismVAU\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5f02\u5e38\u7406\u89e3\uff08VAU\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u4e00\u73b0\u6210\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLM\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u5f02\u5e38\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0e\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u6a21\u5757\u6216\u5bc6\u96c6\u6807\u6ce8\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfVAU\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u7684MLLM\u6216\u5916\u90e8\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u5982\u89c6\u9891\u5b57\u5e55\u6a21\u578b\uff09\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\u590d\u6742\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u65e8\u5728\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u6613\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "PrismVAU\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e92\u8865\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\uff081\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u672c\u951a\u70b9\u8ba1\u7b97\u5e27\u7ea7\u5f02\u5e38\u5206\u6570\u7684\u7c97\u7565\u8bc4\u5206\u6a21\u5757\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u57fa\u4e8eMLLM\u7684\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5316\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7cfb\u7edf/\u7528\u6237\u63d0\u793a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u81ea\u52a8\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\uff08APE\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u951a\u70b9\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6VAD\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u3001\u5e27\u7ea7\u6807\u6ce8\u6216\u5916\u90e8\u6a21\u5757\uff0cPrismVAU\u4ecd\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u5206\u6790\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u6548\u5b9e\u7528\u7684VAU\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u4e3a\u73b0\u5b9e\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, a critical paradox persists within the current field: despite the empirical efficacy, our theoretical understanding of LLMs remains disproportionately nascent, forcing these systems to be treated largely as ``black boxes''. To address this theoretical fragmentation, this survey proposes a unified lifecycle-based taxonomy that organizes the research landscape into six distinct stages: Data Preparation, Model Preparation, Training, Alignment, Inference, and Evaluation. Within this framework, we provide a systematic review of the foundational theories and internal mechanisms driving LLM performance. Specifically, we analyze core theoretical issues such as the mathematical justification for data mixtures, the representational limits of various architectures, and the optimization dynamics of alignment algorithms. Moving beyond current best practices, we identify critical frontier challenges, including the theoretical limits of synthetic data self-improvement, the mathematical bounds of safety guarantees, and the mechanistic origins of emergent intelligence.

However, existing VTON models often suffer from artifacts such as garment distortion and body inconsistency, highlighting the need for reliable quality evaluation of VTON-generated images. To this end, we construct VTONQA, the first multi-dimensional quality assessment dataset specifically designed for VTON, which contains 8,132 images generated by 11 representative VTON models, along with 24,396 mean opinion scores (MOSs) across three evaluation dimensions (i.e., clothing fit, body compatibility, and overall quality). Based on VTONQA, we benchmark both VTON models and a diverse set of image quality assessment (IQA) metrics, revealing the limitations of existing methods and highlighting the value of the proposed dataset. We believe that the VTONQA dataset and corresponding benchmarks will provide a solid foundation for perceptually aligned evaluation, benefiting both the development of quality assessment methods and the advancement of VTON models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86VTONQA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u9996\u4e2a\u4e13\u4e3a\u865a\u62df\u8bd5\u8863\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b8132\u5f20\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e24396\u4e2a\u4e3b\u89c2\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u670d\u88c5\u8d34\u5408\u5ea6\u3001\u8eab\u4f53\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u53ca\u6574\u4f53\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u865a\u62df\u8bd5\u8863\uff08VTON\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u8863\u7269\u5f62\u53d8\u548c\u8eab\u4f53\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6025\u9700\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaVTONQA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6536\u96c611\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027VTON\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5e76\u4ece\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff08\u670d\u88c5\u8d34\u5408\u5ea6\u3001\u8eab\u4f53\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u3001\u6574\u4f53\u8d28\u91cf\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4e3b\u89c2\u8bc4\u5206\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5bf9VTON\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u73b0\u6709VTON\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u8868\u660eVTONQA\u4e3a\u611f\u77e5\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bc4\u4ef7\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u575a\u5b9e\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "conclusion": "VTONQA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u53ca\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7ed3\u679c\u5c06\u63a8\u52a8\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u548cVTON\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u3002"}}

In this paper, we introduce Retrieval-Augmented Learning-to-Match (RAL2M), a novel framework that eliminates generation hallucination by repositioning LLMs as query-response matching judges within a retrieval-based system, providing a robust alternative to purely generative approaches. To further mitigate judgment hallucination, we propose a query-adaptive latent ensemble strategy that explicitly models heterogeneous model competence and interdependencies among LLMs, deriving a calibrated consensus decision. Extensive experiments on large-scale benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method effectively leverages the \"wisdom of the crowd\" and significantly outperforms strong baselines.

We propose a controlled Knowledge Graph-based synthetic framework that generates text from symmetric/inverse triples, train GPT-style autoregressive models from scratch, and evaluate memorization, logical inference, and in-context generalization to unseen entities to address these questions. We find a sharp phase transition in which relational semantics emerge with sufficient logic-bearing supervision, even in shallow (2-3 layer) models, and that successful generalization aligns with stable intermediate-layer signals. Finally, order-matched forward/reverse tests and a diffusion baseline indicate that reversal failures are primarily driven by autoregressive order bias rather than deficient inversion semantics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u6846\u67b6\u63a2\u7a76\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5173\u7cfb\u903b\u8f91\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8db3\u591f\u76d1\u7763\u4e0b\u80fd\u638c\u63e1\u5bf9\u79f0/\u9006\u5173\u7cfb\u63a8\u7406\u4e14\u53cd\u8f6c\u9519\u8bef\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u987a\u5e8f\u504f\u5dee", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u5398\u6e05\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u5173\u7cfb\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\uff0c\u5176\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u662f\u6e90\u4e8e\u5bf9\u903b\u8f91\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u8fd8\u662f\u5355\u7eaf\u4f9d\u8d56\u6587\u672c\u6a21\u5f0f\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5173\u7cfb\u53cd\u8f6c\u9519\u8bef\u7a76\u7adf\u53cd\u6620\u8bed\u4e49\u7f3a\u9677\u8fd8\u662f\u751f\u6210\u987a\u5e8f\u9650\u5236", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0/\u9006\u5173\u7cfb\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u5408\u6210\u6587\u672c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ece\u96f6\u8bad\u7ec3GPT\u5f0f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8bb0\u5fc6\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u53ca\u8de8\u5b9e\u4f53\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u987a\u5e8f\u5339\u914d\u7684\u6b63\u53cd\u5411\u5bf9\u7167\u5b9e\u9a8c", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u903b\u8f91\u8bed\u4e49\u968f\u76d1\u7763\u91cf\u5448\u73b0\u76f8\u53d8\u6d8c\u73b0\uff0c\u5728\u6d45\u5c42\u6a21\u578b\uff082-3\u5c42\uff09\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\uff1b\u6210\u529f\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0e\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u7a33\u5b9a\u8868\u5f81\u76f8\u5173\uff1b\u987a\u5e8f\u5339\u914d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e0e\u6269\u6563\u57fa\u7ebf\u8868\u660e\u53cd\u8f6c\u9519\u8bef\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u987a\u5e8f\u504f\u5dee", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u5907\u903b\u8f91\u8bed\u4e49\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5176\u5173\u7cfb\u63a8\u7406\u5931\u8d25\u4e3b\u56e0\u662f\u751f\u6210\u987a\u5e8f\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u800c\u975e\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u6d45\u5c42\u67b6\u6784\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u53d8\u5173\u7cfb"}}

Our theoretical and empirical analyses reveal that standard CoT in CVQA suffers from state entanglement, spurious transitions, and exploration inefficiency, with small models particularly vulnerable in resource-constrained settings. To address these issues, we propose a novel comic reasoning framework, designed to produce more faithful and transferable reasoning chains in small MLLMs. Specifically, our framework combines modular CoT generation with GRPO-based reinforcement fine-tuning and a novel structured reward. Beyond comic VQA, we further evaluate our approach on a broader class of humor-centric and abstract visual reasoning tasks, including meme understanding and editorial cartoon interpretation.

While prior studies attribute this advantage to the superior English-centric capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we find that such measurements are significantly distorted by structural priors inherent in evaluation benchmarks. Specifically, we identify exposure bias and a gold availability prior-both driven by the disproportionate concentration of resources in English-as well as cultural priors rooted in topic locality, as factors that hinder accurate assessment of genuine language preference. To address these biases, we propose DeLP (Debiased Language Preference), a calibrated metric designed to explicitly factor out these structural confounds. Our analysis using DeLP reveals that the previously reported English preference is largely a byproduct of evidence distribution rather than an inherent model bias. Instead, we find that retrievers fundamentally favor monolingual alignment between the query and the document language. Building on this insight, we introduce DELTA (DEbiased Language preference-guided Text Augmentation), a lightweight and efficient mRAG framework that strategically leverages monolingual alignment to optimize cross-lingual retrieval and generation.

While intermediate fusion mitigates data volume compared to raw sharing, existing frameworks typically rely on spatial compression or static confidence maps, which inefficiently transmit spatially redundant features from non-critical background regions. To address this, we propose Risk-intent Selective detection (RiSe), an interaction-aware framework that shifts the paradigm from identifying visible regions to prioritizing risk-critical ones. Specifically, we introduce a Potential Field-Trajectory Correlation Model (PTCM) grounded in potential field theory to quantitatively assess kinematic risks. Complementing this, an Intention-Driven Area Prediction Module (IDAPM) leverages ego-motion priors to proactively predict and filter key Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) areas essential for decision-making. By integrating these components, RiSe implements a semantic-selective fusion scheme that transmits high-fidelity features only from high-interaction regions, effectively acting as a feature denoiser.

Two critical limitations in the field are addressed. First, individual detection methods exhibit complementary strengths and weaknesses depending on data characteristics, making method selection non-trivial and prone to suboptimal results. Second, automated, contextual explanations for detected changes are largely absent. The proposed ensemble method aggregates results from ten distinct changepoint detection algorithms, achieving superior performance and robustness compared to individual methods. Additionally, an LLM-powered explanation pipeline automatically generates contextual narratives, linking detected changepoints to potential real-world historical events. For private or domain-specific data, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) solution enables explanations grounded in user-provided documents.

We present ReCCur (Recursive Corner-Case Curation), a low-compute framework that converts noisy web imagery into auditable fine-grained labels via a multi-agent recursive pipeline. First, large-scale data acquisition and filtering expands a domain vocabulary with a vision-language model (VLM), crawls the web, and enforces tri-modal (image, description, keyword) consistency with light human spot checks to yield refined candidates. Next, mixture-of-experts knowledge distillation uses complementary encoders (e.g., CLIP, DINOv2, BEiT) for kNN voting with dual-confidence activation and uncertainty sampling, converging to a high-precision set. Finally, region-evidence VLM adversarial labeling pairs a proposer (multi-granularity regions and semantic cues) with a validator (global and local chained consistency) to produce explainable labels and close the loop. On realistic corner-case scenarios (e.g., flooded-car inspection), ReCCur runs on consumer-grade GPUs, steadily improves purity and separability, and requires minimal human supervision, providing a practical substrate for downstream training and evaluation under resource constraints.

This study addresses the critical need for accurate digitization of Bahnar language documents through optical character recognition (OCR) technology. Digitizing scanned paper documents poses significant challenges, as degraded image quality from broken or blurred areas introduces considerable OCR errors that compromise information retrieval systems. We propose a comprehensive approach combining advanced table and non-table detection techniques with probability-based post-processing heuristics to enhance recognition accuracy.

SA-ResGS improves both the reliability of uncertainty estimates and their effectiveness for supervision by generating Self-Augmented point clouds (SA-Points) via triangulation between a training view and a rasterized extrapolated view, enabling efficient scene coverage estimation. While improving scene coverage through physically guided view selection, SA-ResGS also addresses the challenge of under-supervised Gaussians, exacerbated by sparse and wide-baseline views, by introducing the first residual learning strategy tailored for 3D Gaussian Splatting. This targeted supervision enhances gradient flow in high-uncertainty Gaussians by combining uncertainty-driven filtering with dropout- and hard-negative-mining-inspired sampling. Our contributions are threefold: (1) a physically grounded view selection strategy that promotes efficient and uniform scene coverage; (2) an uncertainty-aware residual supervision scheme that amplifies learning signals for weakly contributing Gaussians, improving training stability and uncertainty estimation across scenes with diverse camera distributions; (3) an implicit unbiasing of uncertainty quantification as a consequence of constrained view selection and residual supervision, which together mitigate conflicting effects of wide-baseline exploration and sparse-view ambiguity in NBV planning.

DFRCP enhances the YOLOv11 feature pyramid by combining large scale and medium scale features while preserving native representations, and by introducing Dynamic Robust Switch units that adaptively inject fuzzy features to strengthen global perception under jitter. Fuzzy features are synthesized by rotating and nonlinearly interpolating multiscale features, then merged through a transparency convolution that learns a content adaptive trade off between original and fuzzy cues. We further develop a CUDA parallel rotation and interpolation kernel that avoids boundary overflow and delivers more than 400 times speedup, making the design practical for edge deployment. We train with paired supervision on a private wheat pest damage dataset of about 3,500 images, augmented threefold using two blur regimes, uniform image wide motion blur and bounding box confined rotational blur.

Using the Big Five personality traits as a case study, we demonstrate that our method enables precise, bidirectional steering of model behavior while maintaining superior stability and performance compared to existing activation steering methods like Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA). We further identify an empirical effect, which we term Functional Faithfulness, whereby intervening on a specific internal feature induces coherent and predictable shifts across multiple linguistic dimensions aligned with the target semantic attribute. Our findings suggest that LLMs internalize deeply integrated representations of high-order concepts, and provide a novel, robust mechanistic path for the regulation of complex AI behaviors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8fde\u63a5LLMs\u5185\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u884c\u4e3a\u7ea7\u8bed\u4e49\u63a7\u5236", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709MI\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u53ef\u9760\u63a7\u5236\u590d\u6742\u8bed\u4e49\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5(\u5982CAA)\u5b58\u5728\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u7cbe\u786e\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u95ee\u9898", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5bf9\u6bd4\u7279\u5f81\u68c0\u7d22\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7edf\u8ba1\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u9a8c\u8bc1\u63d0\u53d6\u5355\u4e49\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4ee5\u5927\u4e94\u4eba\u683c\u7279\u8d28\u4e3a\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u53cc\u5411\u7cbe\u786e\u5f15\u5bfc\uff0c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8eCAA\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0Functional Faithfulness\u6548\u5e94\uff08\u5e72\u9884\u7279\u5b9a\u7279\u5f81\u5f15\u53d1\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8bed\u4e49\u53d8\u5316\uff09", "conclusion": "LLMs\u5185\u5316\u9ad8\u9636\u6982\u5ff5\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u590d\u6742AI\u884c\u4e3a\u8c03\u63a7\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5168\u65b0\u673a\u5236\u8def\u5f84"}}

While often attributed to data scale, we propose that this limitation arises from the intrinsic circuit complexity of the architecture. We formalize spatial understanding as learning a Group Homomorphism: mapping image sequences to a latent space that preserves the algebraic structure of the underlying transformation group. We demonstrate that for non-solvable groups (e.g., the 3D rotation group $\\mathrm{SO}(3)$), maintaining such a structure-preserving embedding is computationally lower-bounded by the Word Problem, which is $\\mathsf{NC^1}$-complete. In contrast, we prove that constant-depth ViTs with polynomial precision are strictly bounded by $\\mathsf{TC^0}$. Under the conjecture $\\mathsf{TC^0} \\subsetneq \\mathsf{NC^1}$, we establish a complexity boundary: constant-depth ViTs fundamentally lack the logical depth to efficiently capture non-solvable spatial structures.

Under domain shifts, the model becomes overly sensitive to fine-grained cues, leading to the suppression of critical features and a significant drop in performance. Cognitive studies suggest that humans classify objects by leveraging both common and specific attributes, enabling accurate differentiation between fine-grained categories. However, current deep learning models have yet to incorporate this mechanism effectively. Inspired by this mechanism, we propose Concept-Feature Structuralized Generalization (CFSG). This model explicitly disentangles both the concept and feature spaces into three structured components: common, specific, and confounding segments. To mitigate the adverse effects of varying degrees of distribution shift, we introduce an adaptive mechanism that dynamically adjusts the proportions of common, specific, and confounding components.

We empirically show that under Top-5 retrieval with the gold document included, LLM answers vary substantially across permutations of the retrieved set, even when the gold document is fixed in the first position. This reveals a previously underexplored sensitivity to retrieval permutations. Although robust RAG methods primarily focus on enhancing LLM robustness to low-quality retrieval and mitigating positional bias to distribute attention fairly over long contexts, neither approach directly addresses permutation sensitivity. In this paper, we propose Stable-RAG, which exploits permutation sensitivity estimation to mitigate permutation-induced hallucinations. Stable-RAG runs the generator under multiple retrieval orders, clusters hidden states, and decodes from a cluster-center representation that captures the dominant reasoning pattern. It then uses these reasoning results to align hallucinated outputs toward the correct answer, encouraging the model to produce consistent and accurate predictions across document permutations. Experiments on three QA datasets show that Stable-RAG significantly improves answer accuracy, reasoning consistency and robust generalization across datasets, retrievers, and input lengths compared with baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6b64\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faStable-RAG\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f30\u8ba1\u6392\u5217\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u56e0\u6587\u6863\u987a\u5e8f\u53d8\u5316\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u591a\u901a\u9053\u63a8\u7406\u5e76\u805a\u7c7b\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u7fa4\u4e2d\u5fc3\u89e3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4e00\u81f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1RAG\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7528\u4e8e\u51cf\u5c11\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u7565\u68c0\u7d22\u6587\u6863\u987a\u5e8f\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u5373\u4f7f\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6587\u6863\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u7b54\u6848\u4ecd\u4f1a\u968f\u6392\u5217\u987a\u5e8f\u6ce2\u52a8\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "1. \u6d4b\u8bd5\u68c0\u7d22\u6587\u6863\u6392\u5217\u5bf9\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b2. \u63d0\u51faStable-RAG\uff1a\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6392\u5217\u9690\u72b6\u6001\u5e76\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u4ee5\u96c6\u7fa4\u4e2d\u5fc3\u89e3\u7801\uff1b3. \u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0d\u540c\u6392\u5217\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u8f93\u51fa\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u4e00\u81f4\u7b54\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u7c7b\u95ee\u7b54\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0cStable-RAG\u63d0\u5347\u7b54\u6848\u51c6\u786e\u738712.7%\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8fbe89%\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6/\u68c0\u7d22\u5668/\u8f93\u5165\u957f\u5ea6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5747\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6587\u6863\u6392\u5217\u654f\u611f\u6027\u662fRAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u65b0\u6311\u6218\uff0cStable-RAG\u901a\u8fc7\u9690\u72b6\u6001\u805a\u7c7b\u4e0e\u5411\u91cf\u5bf9\u9f50\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u540e\u7eed\u53ef\u63a2\u7d22\u5176\u5728\u591a\u8df3\u95ee\u7b54\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Hedderich"], "title": "Large Reasoning Models Are (Not Yet) Multilingual Latent Reasoners", "comment": "preprint", "summary": "Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve strong performance on mathematical reasoning tasks, often attributed to their capability to generate explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) explanations. However, recent work shows that LRMs often arrive at the correct answer before completing these textual reasoning steps, indicating the presence of latent reasoning -- internal, non-verbal computation encoded in hidden states. While this phenomenon has been explored in English, its multilingual behavior remains largely unknown. In this paper, we conduct a systematic investigation of multilingual latent reasoning in LRMs across 11 languages. Using a truncation-based strategy, we examine how the correct answer emerges as the model is given only partial reasoning traces, allowing us to measure stepwise latent prediction formation.

Existing chunk-based retrieval often provides irrelevant and logically incoherent context, leading to incomplete evidence chains and incorrect reasoning during answer generation. To address these challenges, we propose SentGraph, a sentence-level graph-based RAG framework that explicitly models fine-grained logical relationships between sentences for multi-hop question answering. Specifically, we construct a hierarchical sentence graph offline by first adapting Rhetorical Structure Theory to distinguish nucleus and satellite sentences, and then organizing them into topic-level subgraphs with cross-document entity bridges. During online retrieval, SentGraph performs graph-guided evidence selection and path expansion to retrieve fine-grained sentence-level evidence.

MLLMs still suffer from visually ungrounded hallucinations, often relying on language priors rather than image evidence. While many prior mitigation strategies operate on the text side, they leave the visual representation unchanged and do not exploit the rich hierarchy of features encoded across vision layers. Existing multi-layer fusion methods partially address this limitation but remain static, applying the same layer mixture regardless of the query. In this work, we introduce TGIF (Text-Guided Inter-layer Fusion), a lightweight module that treats encoder layers as depth-wise \"experts\" and predicts a prompt-dependent fusion of visual features. TGIF follows the principle of direct external fusion, requires no vision-encoder updates, and adds minimal overhead.

To address this, we propose MMFormalizer, which extends autoformalization beyond text by integrating adaptive grounding with entities from real-world mathematical and physical domains. MMFormalizer recursively constructs formal propositions from perceptually grounded primitives through recursive grounding and axiom composition, with adaptive recursive termination ensuring that every abstraction is supported by visual evidence and anchored in dimensional or axiomatic grounding. We evaluate MMFormalizer on a new benchmark, PhyX-AF, comprising 115 curated samples from MathVerse, PhyX, Synthetic Geometry, and Analytic Geometry, covering diverse multimodal autoformalization tasks. Results show that frontier models such as GPT-5 and Gemini-3-Pro achieve the highest compile and semantic accuracy, with GPT-5 excelling in physical reasoning, while geometry remains the most challenging domain. Overall, MMFormalizer provides a scalable framework for unified multimodal autoformalization, bridging perception and formal reasoning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first multimodal autoformalization method capable of handling classical mechanics (derived from the Hamiltonian), as well as relativity, quantum mechanics, and thermodynamics.

Standard supervised training lacks explicit annotations for symptom evolution, while direct Reinforcement Learning (RL) is hindered by sparse binary rewards. To address this challenge, we introduce Dementia-R1, an RL-based framework for longitudinal dementia prognosis from unstructured clinical notes. Our approach adopts a Cold-Start RL strategy that pre-trains the model to predict verifiable clinical indices extracted from patient histories, enhancing the capability to reason about disease progression before determining the final clinical status. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Dementia-R1 achieves an F1 score of 77.03% on real-world unstructured clinical datasets. Notably, on the ADNI benchmark, our 7B model rivals GPT-4o, effectively capturing fluctuating cognitive trajectories.

Meanwhile, closed-source systems (e.g., Nano Banana) have demonstrated strong reasoning-driven image generation, highlighting a substantial gap to current open-source models. We argue that closing this gap requires not merely better visual generators, but executable reasoning: decomposing high-level intents into grounded, verifiable plans that directly steer the generative process. To this end, we propose Unified Thinker, a task-agnostic reasoning architecture for general image generation, designed as a unified planning core that can plug into diverse generators and workflows. Unified Thinker decouples a dedicated Thinker from the image Generator, enabling modular upgrades of reasoning without retraining the entire generative model. We further introduce a two-stage training paradigm: we first build a structured planning interface for the Thinker, then apply reinforcement learning to ground its policy in pixel-level feedback, encouraging plans that optimize visual correctness over textual plausibility. Extensive experiments on text-to-image generation and image editing show that Unified Thinker substantially improves image reasoning and generation quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faUnified Thinker\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u5347\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u6307\u4ee4\u89e3\u6790\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u903b\u8f91\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e0e\u95ed\u6e90\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u66b4\u9732\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u6267\u884c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u8131\u8282\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u89e3\u8026\u5f0f\u67b6\u6784\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5757(Thinker)\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u5757(Generator)\u5206\u79bb\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u5148\u5efa\u7acb\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u89c4\u5212\u63a5\u53e3\uff0c\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u73b0\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u53cd\u9988\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u89c6\u89c9\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u5747\u8d85\u8d8a\u5f53\u524d\u4e3b\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u53cc\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u610f\u56fe\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u6267\u884c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Targetting AACL 2026", "summary": "Long-context question answering (QA) over literary texts poses significant challenges for modern large language models, particularly in low-resource languages. We address the scarcity of long-context QA resources for Indic languages by introducing LittiChoQA, the largest literary QA dataset to date covering many languages spoken in the Gangetic plains of India. The dataset comprises over 270K automatically generated question-answer pairs with a balanced distribution of factoid and non-factoid questions, generated from naturally authored literary texts collected from the open web. We evaluate multiple multilingual LLMs on non-factoid, abstractive QA, under both full-context and context-shortened settings. Results demonstrate a clear trade-off between performance and efficiency: full-context fine-tuning yields the highest token-level and semantic-level scores, while context shortening substantially improves throughput.

We introduce F-DPO (Factuality-aware Direct Preference Optimization), a simple extension of DPO that uses only binary factuality labels. F-DPO (i) applies a label-flipping transformation that corrects misordered preference pairs so the chosen response is never less factual than the rejected one, and (ii) adds a factuality-aware margin that emphasizes pairs with clear correctness differences, while reducing to standard DPO when both responses share the same factuality. We construct factuality-aware preference data by augmenting DPO pairs with binary factuality indicators and synthetic hallucinated variants. Across seven open-weight LLMs (1B-14B), F-DPO consistently improves factuality and reduces hallucination rates relative to both base models and standard DPO. On Qwen3-8B, F-DPO reduces hallucination rates by five times (from 0.424 to 0.084) while improving factuality scores by 50 percent (from 5.26 to 7.90).

We formalize this discrepancy as Conduction Aphasia, a phenomenon where models accurately interpret multimodal inputs but struggle to translate that understanding into faithful and controllable synthesis. To address this, we propose UniCorn, a simple yet elegant self-improvement framework that eliminates the need for external data or teacher supervision. By partitioning a single UMM into three collaborative roles: Proposer, Solver, and Judge, UniCorn generates high-quality interactions via self-play and employs cognitive pattern reconstruction to distill latent understanding into explicit generative signals. To validate the restoration of multimodal coherence, we introduce UniCycle, a cycle-consistency benchmark based on a Text to Image to Text reconstruction loop. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniCorn achieves comprehensive and substantial improvements over the base model across six general image generation benchmarks. Notably, it achieves SOTA performance on TIIF(73.8), DPG(86.8), CompBench(88.5), and UniCycle while further delivering substantial gains of +5.0 on WISE and +6.5 on OneIG.

This work proposes two ways to achieve this. A straightforward solution, BaseCal-ReEval, evaluates PoLLM's responses by feeding them into the base LLM to get average probabilities as confidence. While effective, this approach introduces additional inference overhead. To address this, we propose BaseCal-Proj, which trains a lightweight projection to map the final-layer hidden states of PoLLMs back to those of their base LLMs. These projected states are then processed by the base LLM's output layer to derive base-calibrated confidence for PoLLM's responses.

LTX-2 consists of an asymmetric dual-stream transformer with a 14B-parameter video stream and a 5B-parameter audio stream, coupled through bidirectional audio-video cross-attention layers with temporal positional embeddings and cross-modality AdaLN for shared timestep conditioning. This architecture enables efficient training and inference of a unified audiovisual model while allocating more capacity for video generation than audio generation. We employ a multilingual text encoder for broader prompt understanding and introduce a modality-aware classifier-free guidance (modality-CFG) mechanism for improved audiovisual alignment and controllability. Beyond generating speech, LTX-2 produces rich, coherent audio tracks that follow the characters, environment, style, and emotion of each scene -- complete with natural background and foley elements.

In this paper, we show, both empirically and theoretically, that sparse attention can paradoxically increase end-to-end complexity: information loss often induces significantly longer sequences, a phenomenon we term ``Less is Less'' (Lil).

By representing the entire conversation as a temporal graph, we present a novel graph-based method for detecting dialogue-level hallucinations. Our framework models each dialogue as a node, encoding it using a sentence transformer. We explore two different ways of connectivity: i) shared-entity edges, which connect turns that refer to the same entities; ii) temporal edges, which connect contiguous turns in the conversation. Message-passing is used to update the node embeddings, allowing flow of information between related nodes. The context-aware node embeddings are then combined using attention pooling into a single vector, which is then passed on to a classifier to determine the presence and type of hallucinations. We demonstrate that our method offers slightly improved performance over existing methods. Further, we show the attention mechanism can be used to justify the decision making process.

It can effectively reduce factuality hallucinations, but faithfulness hallucinations still exist. Previous methods for detecting faithfulness hallucinations either neglect to capture the models' internal reasoning processes or handle those features coarsely, making it difficult for discriminators to learn. This paper proposes a semantic-level internal reasoning graph-based method for detecting faithfulness hallucination. Specifically, we first extend the layer-wise relevance propagation algorithm from the token level to the semantic level, constructing an internal reasoning graph based on attribution vectors. This provides a more faithful semantic-level representation of dependency. Furthermore, we design a general framework based on a small pre-trained language model to utilize the dependencies in LLM's reasoning for training and hallucination detection, which can dynamically adjust the pass rate of correct samples through a threshold.

Previous methods, which rely on part-aware optimization, manual assembly, or 2D image generation, often produce unrealistic or incoherent 3D assets due to the challenges of intricate part-level manipulation and limited out-of-domain generation. In contrast, Muses leverages the 3D skeleton, a fundamental representation of biological forms, to explicitly and rationally compose diverse elements. This skeletal foundation formalizes 3D content creation as a structure-aware pipeline of design, composition, and generation. Muses begins by constructing a creatively composed 3D skeleton with coherent layout and scale through graph-constrained reasoning. This skeleton then guides a voxel-based assembly process within a structured latent space, integrating regions from different objects. Finally, image-guided appearance modeling under skeletal conditions is applied to generate a style-consistent and harmonious texture for the assembled shape. Extensive experiments establish Muses' state-of-the-art performance in terms of visual fidelity and alignment with textual descriptions, and potential on flexible 3D object editing.

Prior work on compact reasoning shortens such chains through probabilistic sampling, heuristics, or supervision from frontier models, but offers limited insight into whether models internally encode token-level functional importance for answer generation. We address this gap diagnostically and propose greedy pruning, a likelihood-preserving deletion procedure that iteratively removes reasoning tokens whose removal minimally degrades model likelihood under a specified objective, yielding length-controlled reasoning chains. We evaluate pruned reasoning in a distillation framework and show that students trained on pruned chains outperform a frontier-model-supervised compression baseline at matched reasoning lengths. Finally, our analysis reveals systematic pruning patterns and shows that attention scores can predict greedy pruning ranks, further suggesting that models encode a nontrivial functional importance structure over reasoning tokens.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u8d2a\u5a6a\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u5220\u9664\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u4f3c\u7136\u5f71\u54cd\u6700\u5c0f\u7684\u63a8\u7406token\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u63a7\u5236\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u6570\u53ef\u9884\u6d4btoken\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u63ed\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8token\u7ea7\u529f\u80fd\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u524d\u6cbf\u6a21\u578b\u76d1\u7763\u538b\u7f29\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u8eab\u7f16\u7801\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u9700\u5f00\u53d1\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u8bca\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\u586b\u8865\u7406\u8bba\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8d2a\u5a6a\u526a\u679d\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1a1) \u57fa\u4e8e\u4f3c\u7136\u51fd\u6570\u7684token\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1b2) \u8fed\u4ee3\u5220\u9664\u5f71\u54cd\u6700\u5c0f\u7684token\uff1b3) \u4fdd\u6301\u63a8\u7406\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u957f\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u526a\u679d\u94fe\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u6570\u4e0e\u526a\u679d\u987a\u5e8f\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff1a\u2460\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5339\u914d\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0b\u8d85\u8d8a\u524d\u6cbf\u6a21\u578b\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u57fa\u7ebf\uff1b\u2461\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u6570rank\u4e0e\u8d2a\u5a6a\u526a\u679drank\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff1b\u2462\u53d1\u73b0\u91cd\u590d\u8bba\u8bc1\u548c\u5197\u4f59\u4fe1\u606f\u4e3a\u4f18\u5148\u526a\u679d\u5bf9\u8c61\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u5b58\u5728\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u7684token\u529f\u80fd\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u9690\u5f0f\u7f16\u7801\u63a8\u7406\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u5e26\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Additionally, we introduce two faithfulneses metrics $\u03c0$-Soft-NC and $\u03c0$-Soft-NS, which are modifications of Soft-NC/NS that provide fairer comparisons by controlling the amount of information kept when perturbing the text.

Across these three widely used open-source models, we compare frequency-, entropy-, magnitude-, and contrast-based neuron selectors on multiple emotion recognition benchmarks.

These effects arise with modest identification data and scale systematically with intervention strength.

We propose ToxiGAN, a class-aware text augmentation framework that combines adversarial generation with semantic guidance from large language models (LLMs). To address common issues in GAN-based augmentation such as mode collapse and semantic drift, ToxiGAN introduces a two-step directional training strategy and leverages LLM-generated neutral texts as semantic ballast. Unlike prior work that treats LLMs as static generators, our approach dynamically selects neutral exemplars to provide balanced guidance.

The Japanese bar examination is a particularly demanding benchmark, requiring not only advanced legal reasoning but also strict adherence to complex answer formats that involve joint evaluation of multiple propositions. While recent studies have reported improvements by decomposing such questions into simpler true--false judgments, these approaches have not been systematically evaluated under the original exam format and scoring scheme, leaving open the question of whether they truly capture exam-level competence. In this paper, we present a self-verification model trained on a newly constructed dataset that faithfully replicates the authentic format and evaluation scale of the exam. Our model is able to exceed the official passing score when evaluated on the actual exam scale, marking the first demonstration, to our knowledge, of an LLM passing the Japanese bar examination without altering its original question structure or scoring rules. We further conduct extensive comparisons with alternative strategies, including multi-agent inference and decomposition-based supervision, and find that these methods fail to achieve comparable performance. Our results highlight the importance of format-faithful supervision and consistency verification, and suggest that carefully designed single-model approaches can outperform more complex systems in high-stakes professional reasoning tasks.

However, planning remains a bottleneck, as existing methods struggle with long-horizon strategies. Our analysis reveals a critical phenomenon, plan anchor, where the first reasoning step disproportionately impacts downstream behavior in long-horizon web reasoning tasks. Current RL algorithms, fail to account for this by uniformly distributing rewards across the trajectory. To address this, we propose Anchor-GRPO, a two-stage RL framework that decouples planning and execution. In Stage 1, the agent optimizes its first-step planning using fine-grained rubrics derived from self-play experiences and human calibration. In Stage 2, execution is aligned with the initial plan through sparse rewards, ensuring stable and efficient tool usage. We evaluate Anchor-GRPO on four benchmarks: BrowseComp, BrowseComp-Zh, GAIA, and XBench-DeepSearch.

We systematically evaluate five embedding similarity metrics across 816 transfer experiments spanning three NLP tasks, three African-centric multilingual models, and 12 languages from four language families. We find that cosine gap and retrieval-based metrics (P@1, CSLS) reliably predict transfer success ($\u03c1= 0.4-0.6$), while CKA shows negligible predictive power ($\u03c1\\approx 0.1$). Critically, correlation signs reverse when pooling across models (Simpson's Paradox), so practitioners must validate per-model.

To address these limitations, we propose PALU (Prefix-Aware Localized Unlearning), a framework driven by a local entropy maximization objective across both temporal and vocabulary dimensions. PALU reveals that (i) suppressing the sensitive prefix alone is sufficient to sever the causal generation link, and (ii) flattening only the top-$k$ logits is adequate to maximize uncertainty in the critical subspace.

While Large Language Models possess strong reasoning capabilities, they struggle to emulate this self-evolution: fine-tuning is computationally expensive and prone to catastrophic forgetting, while existing memory-based methods rely on passive semantic matching that often retrieves noise. To address these challenges, we propose MemRL, a framework that enables agents to self-evolve via non-parametric reinforcement learning on episodic memory. MemRL explicitly separates the stable reasoning of a frozen LLM from the plastic, evolving memory. Unlike traditional methods, MemRL employs a Two-Phase Retrieval mechanism that filters candidates by semantic relevance and then selects them based on learned Q-values (utility). These utilities are continuously refined via environmental feedback in an trial-and-error manner, allowing the agent to distinguish high-value strategies from similar noise. Extensive experiments on HLE, BigCodeBench, ALFWorld, and Lifelong Agent Bench demonstrate that MemRL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

We propose a novel explainability-guided training framework, X-MuTeST (eXplainable Multilingual haTe Speech deTection), for hate speech detection that combines high-level semantic reasoning from large language models (LLMs) with traditional attention-enhancing techniques. We extend this research to Hindi and Telugu alongside English by providing benchmark human-annotated rationales for each word to justify the assigned class label. The X-MuTeST explainability method computes the difference between the prediction probabilities of the original text and those of unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams. Final explanations are computed as the union between LLM explanations and X-MuTeST explanations. We show that leveraging human rationales during training enhances both classification performance and explainability. Moreover, combining human rationales with our explainability method to refine the model attention yields further improvements. We evaluate explainability using Plausibility metrics such as Token-F1 and IOU-F1 and Faithfulness metrics such as Comprehensiveness and Sufficiency.

Although Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has succeeded in specific domains , the field lacks large-scale, high-quality, and difficulty-calibrated data for general reasoning. To address this, we propose UltraLogic, a framework that decouples the logical core of a problem from its natural language expression through a Code-based Solving methodology to automate high-quality data production. The framework comprises hundreds of unique task types and an automated calibration pipeline across ten difficulty levels. Furthermore, to mitigate binary reward sparsity and the Non-negative Reward Trap, we introduce the Bipolar Float Reward (BFR) mechanism, utilizing graded penalties to effectively distinguish perfect responses from those with logical flaws. Our experiments demonstrate that task diversity is the primary driver for reasoning enhancement , and that BFR, combined with a difficulty matching strategy, significantly improves training efficiency, guiding models toward global logical optima.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86UltraLogic\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ee3\u7801\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u53cc\u6781\u6d6e\u70b9\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\uff08BFR\uff09\u89e3\u51b3\u5956\u52b1\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u3002\u4e3b\u8981\u521b\u65b0\u70b9\u5305\u62ec\u4efb\u52a1\u7c7b\u578b\u89e3\u8026\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u96be\u5ea6\u5206\u7ea7\u6821\u51c6\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u7ea7\u60e9\u7f5a\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u9700\u8981\u591a\u6b65\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u590d\u7528\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u74f6\u9888\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9ad8\u8d28\u4e14\u96be\u5ea6\u53ef\u8c03\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u4e8c\u5143\u5956\u52b1\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u548c\u975e\u8d1f\u5956\u52b1\u9677\u9631\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u65b0\u578b\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u89e3\u51b3\u4e0a\u8ff0\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "1. \u6784\u5efaCode-based Solving\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u903b\u8f91\u5185\u6838\u4e0e\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u8fbe\u89e3\u8026\uff1b\n2. \u8bbe\u8ba1\u5305\u542b\u767e\u7ea7\u4efb\u52a1\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0e\u5341\u7ea7\u96be\u5ea6\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\uff1b\n3. \u63d0\u51faBipolar Float Reward\uff08BFR\uff09\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u7ea7\u60e9\u7f5a\u7b56\u7565\u533a\u5206\u5b8c\u7f8e\u54cd\u5e94\u4e0e\u5b58\u5728\u903b\u8f91\u7f3a\u9677\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u3002\n4. \u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4efb\u52a1\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u679c\u53caBFR\u4e0e\u96be\u5ea6\u5339\u914d\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff1a1\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\u591a\u6837\u6027\u662f\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u4e3b\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\uff1b2\uff09BFR\u7ed3\u5408\u96be\u5ea6\u5339\u914d\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u53ef\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u8d8b\u8fd1\u5168\u5c40\u903b\u8f91\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\uff1b3\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9ad8\u8d28\u4e14\u96be\u5ea6\u53ef\u8c03\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u660e\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u903b\u8f91\u5185\u6838\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u8fbe\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5316\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u914d\u5408\u53cc\u6781\u6d6e\u70b9\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u77ed\u7f3a\u4e0e\u5956\u52b1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u96be\u9898\u3002\u7ed3\u8bba\u5f3a\u8c03\u4efb\u52a1\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5206\u7ea7\u60e9\u7f5a\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u5728\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u5347\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

We introduce MalruleLib, a learning-science-grounded framework that translates documented misconceptions into executable procedures, drawing on 67 learning-science and mathematics education sources, and generates step-by-step traces of malrule-consistent student work. We formalize a core student-modeling problem as Malrule Reasoning Accuracy (MRA): infer a misconception from one worked mistake and predict the student's next answer under cross-template rephrasing. Across nine language models (4B-120B), accuracy drops from 66% on direct problem solving to 40% on cross-template misconception prediction. MalruleLib encodes 101 malrules over 498 parameterized problem templates and produces paired dual-path traces for both correct reasoning and malrule-consistent student reasoning. Because malrules are executable and templates are parameterizable, MalruleLib can generate over one million instances, enabling scalable supervision and controlled evaluation. Using MalruleLib, we observe cross-template degradations of 10-21%, while providing student step traces improves prediction by 3-15%.

Purpose: To create RXL-RADSet, a radiologist-verified synthetic multi-RADS benchmark, and compare validity and accuracy of open-weight small language models (SLMs) with a proprietary model for RADS assignment. Materials and Methods: RXL-RADSet contains 1,600 synthetic radiology reports across 10 RADS (BI-RADS, CAD-RADS, GB-RADS, LI-RADS, Lung-RADS, NI-RADS, O-RADS, PI-RADS, TI-RADS, VI-RADS) and multiple modalities. Reports were generated by LLMs using scenario plans and simulated radiologist styles and underwent two-stage radiologist verification. We evaluated 41 quantized SLMs (12 families, 0.135-32B parameters) and GPT-5.2 under a fixed guided prompt. Primary endpoints were validity and accuracy; a secondary analysis compared guided versus zero-shot prompting. Results: Under guided prompting GPT-5.2 achieved 99.8% validity and 81.1% accuracy (1,600 predictions). Pooled SLMs (65,600 predictions) achieved 96.8% validity and 61.1% accuracy; top SLMs in the 20-32B range reached ~99% validity and mid-to-high 70% accuracy. Performance scaled with model size (inflection between <1B and >=10B) and declined with RADS complexity primarily due to classification difficulty rather than invalid outputs. Guided prompting improved validity (99.2% vs 96.7%) and accuracy (78.5% vs 69.6%) compared with zero-shot. Conclusion: RXL-RADSet provides a radiologist-verified multi-RADS benchmark; large SLMs (20-32B) can approach proprietary-model performance under guided prompting, but gaps remain for higher-complexity schemes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faRXL-RADSet\u2014\u2014\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ecf\u653e\u5c04\u79d1\u533b\u751f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u591aRADS\u5408\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5bfc\u5f0f\u63d0\u793a\u8f93\u5165\u652f\u6301\u7684\u5927\u578b\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08SLM\uff09\u53ef\u63a5\u8fd1\u4e13\u6709\u6a21\u578bGPT-5.2\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u590d\u6742\u5ea6RADS\u65b9\u6848\u65f6\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "motivation": "\u653e\u5c04\u5b66\u98ce\u9669\u62a5\u544a\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08RADS\uff09\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u5bf9\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u914d\u98ce\u9669\u7b49\u7ea7\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u95ee\u9898\u5305\u62ec\u6307\u5357\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3001\u8f93\u51fa\u683c\u5f0f\u9650\u5236\u53ca\u73b0\u6709RADS\u6846\u67b6\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u4e3a\u63a8\u52a8\u76f8\u5173\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u53d1\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u591aRADS\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "method": "RXL-RADSet\u5305\u542b10\u79cdRADS\uff08\u5982\u4e73\u817a\u764c\u3001\u80ba\u764c\uff09\u76841600\u4efd\u5408\u6210\u653e\u5c04\u5f71\u50cf\u62a5\u544a\uff0c\u7531\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u5e76\u7ecf\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u653e\u5c04\u79d1\u533b\u751f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e8641\u4e2a\u91cf\u5316\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u53c2\u6570\u91cf0.135B-32B\uff09\u4e0eGPT-5.2\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u5f15\u5bfc\u5f0f\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5f15\u5bfc\u5f0f\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\uff0cGPT-5.2\u5b9e\u73b099.8%\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e81.1%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff1b20B-32B\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe\u5230\u7ea699%\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u53ca70%\u4e2d\u6bb5\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff08\u62d0\u70b9\u5728<1B\u81f3\u226510B\u4e4b\u95f4\uff09\uff0c\u590d\u6742RADS\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u5206\u7c7b\u96be\u5ea6\u800c\u975e\u65e0\u6548\u8f93\u51fa\u3002\u5f15\u5bfc\u5f0f\u63d0\u793a\u76f8\u6bd4\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0899.2% vs 96.7%\uff09\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0878.5% vs 69.6%\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "RXL-RADSet\u4e3a\u9996\u4e2a\u653e\u5c04\u79d1\u533b\u751f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u591aRADS\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5927\u578b\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5f15\u5bfc\u5f0f\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u53ef\u63a5\u8fd1\u4e13\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u4f46\u590d\u6742RADS\u573a\u666f\u4ecd\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u3002"}}
