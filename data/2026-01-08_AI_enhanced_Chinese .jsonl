However, we identify a critical bottleneck: the retrieval-utilization gap, where models fail to use gold evidence even after it is retrieved, due to context blindness in noisy environments. To bridge this gap, we propose DeepResearch-Slice, a simple yet effective neuro-symbolic framework. Unlike implicit attention, our approach predicts precise span indices to perform a deterministic hard filter before reasoning. Extensive evaluations across six benchmarks show substantial robustness gains. Applying our method to frozen backbones yields a 73 percent relative improvement, from 19.1 percent to 33.0 percent, effectively mitigating noise without requiring parameter updates to the reasoning model. These results highlight the need for explicit grounding mechanisms in open-ended research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDeepResearch-Slice\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u8fc7\u6ee4\u673a\u5236\u89e3\u51b3\u68c0\u7d22\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u76f2\u89c6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u68c0\u7d22-\u5229\u7528\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u6210\u529f\u68c0\u7d22\u8bc1\u636e\u4ecd\u56e0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u76f2\u89c6\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u5e72\u6270\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\uff0c\u9700\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u76f4\u63a5\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u7b5b\u9009\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u663e\u5f0f\u8de8\u5ea6\u7d22\u5f15\u9884\u6d4b\u8fdb\u884c\u786c\u8fc7\u6ee4\uff08\u800c\u975e\u9690\u5f0f\u6ce8\u610f\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u63a9\u7801\u76f4\u63a5\u622a\u53d6\u5173\u952e\u8bc1\u636e\u6bb5\u843d\u4f9b\u540e\u7eed\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u51b7\u51bb\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f9719.1%\u523033.0%\u7684\u7edd\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\uff0873%\u76f8\u5bf9\u6539\u8fdb\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u66f4\u65b0\u53c2\u6570\u5373\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u566a\u58f0\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u516d\u9879\u57fa\u51c6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bc1\u5b9e\u663e\u5f0f\u8bc1\u636e\u951a\u5b9a\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u5f25\u8865\u9690\u5f0f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e3a\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u514d\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

"Zhigang Wang"], "title": "OpenAI GPT-5 System Card", "comment": null, "summary": "This is the system card published alongside the OpenAI GPT-5 launch, August 2025.\n  GPT-5 is a unified system with a smart and fast model that answers most questions, a deeper reasoning model for harder problems, and a real-time router that quickly decides which model to use based on conversation type, complexity, tool needs, and explicit intent (for example, if you say 'think hard about this' in the prompt). The router is continuously trained on real signals, including when users switch models, preference rates for responses, and measured correctness, improving over time. Once usage limits are reached, a mini version of each model handles remaining queries.\n  This system card focuses primarily on gpt-5-thinking and gpt-5-main, while evaluations for other models are available in the appendix. The GPT-5 system not only outperforms previous models on benchmarks and answers questions more quickly, but -- more importantly -- is more useful for real-world queries. We've made significant advances in reducing hallucinations, improving instruction following, and minimizing sycophancy, and have leveled up GPT-5's performance in three of ChatGPT's most common uses: writing, coding, and health.

However, as the number of erased concepts grows, these methods often become inefficient and ineffective, since each concept requires a separate set of fine-tuned parameters and may degrade the overall generation quality. In this work, we propose a supertype-subtype concept hierarchy that organizes erased concepts into a parent-child structure. Each erased concept is treated as a child node, and semantically related concepts (e.g., macaw, and bald eagle) are grouped under a shared parent node, referred to as a supertype concept (e.g., bird). Rather than erasing concepts individually, we introduce an effective and efficient group-wise suppression method, where semantically similar concepts are grouped and erased jointly by sharing a single set of learnable parameters. During the erasure phase, standard diffusion regularization is applied to preserve denoising process in unmasked regions. To mitigate the degradation of supertype generation caused by excessive erasure of semantically related subtypes, we propose a novel method called Supertype-Preserving Low-Rank Adaptation (SuPLoRA), which encodes the supertype concept information in the frozen down-projection matrix and updates only the up-projection matrix during erasure. Theoretical analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of SuPLoRA in mitigating generation performance degradation.

This paper revisits a fundamental yet seldom systematically studied question: how VLM choice and competence translate to downstream VLA policies performance? We introduce VLM4VLA, a minimal adaptation pipeline that converts general-purpose VLMs into VLA policies using only a small set of new learnable parameters for fair and efficient comparison. Despite its simplicity, VLM4VLA proves surprisingly competitive with more sophisticated network designs. Through extensive empirical studies on various downstream tasks across three benchmarks, we find that while VLM initialization offers a consistent benefit over training from scratch, a VLM's general capabilities are poor predictors of its downstream task performance. This challenges common assumptions, indicating that standard VLM competence is necessary but insufficient for effective embodied control. We further investigate the impact of specific embodied capabilities by fine-tuning VLMs on seven auxiliary embodied tasks (e.g., embodied QA, visual pointing, depth estimation). Contrary to intuition, improving a VLM's performance on specific embodied skills does not guarantee better downstream control performance. Finally, modality-level ablations identify the visual module in VLM, rather than the language component, as the primary performance bottleneck. We demonstrate that injecting control-relevant supervision into the vision encoder of the VLM yields consistent gains, even when the encoder remains frozen during downstream fine-tuning. This isolates a persistent domain gap between current VLM pretraining objectives and the requirements of embodied action-planning.", "AI": {"tldr": "VLM4VLA introduces a minimal pipeline to evaluate how Vision-Language Models (VLMs) impact downstream VLA policy performance, revealing that VLM competence alone does not guarantee effective embodied control, with visual modules being the key bottleneck.", "motivation": "To systematically study how VLM choices and their general capabilities translate to VLA policy performance, addressing a poorly understood but critical aspect of embodied AI.", "method": "Proposed VLM4VLA, a minimalist framework that adapts pre-trained VLMs into VLA policies with minimal learnable parameters, enabling fair comparisons.

While existing LLMs can detect harmful or unsafe content, they often struggle with nuanced cases such as implicit offensiveness, subtle gender and racial biases, and jailbreak prompts, due to the subjective and context-dependent nature of these issues. Furthermore, their heavy reliance on training data can reinforce societal biases, resulting in inconsistent and ethically problematic outputs. To address these challenges, we introduce GuardEval, a unified multi-perspective benchmark dataset designed for both training and evaluation, containing 106 fine-grained categories spanning human emotions, offensive and hateful language, gender and racial bias, and broader safety concerns. We also present GemmaGuard (GGuard), a QLoRA fine-tuned version of Gemma3-12B trained on GuardEval, to assess content moderation with fine-grained labels.

To answer this, we present MMErroR, a multi-modal benchmark of 2,013 samples, each embedding a single coherent reasoning error. These samples span 24 subdomains across six top-level domains, ensuring broad coverage and taxonomic richness. Unlike existing benchmarks that focus on answer correctness, MMErroR targets a process-level, error-centric evaluation that requires models to detect incorrect reasoning and classify the error type within both visual and linguistic contexts. We evaluate 20 advanced VLMs, even the best model (Gemini-3.0-Pro) classifies the error in only 66.47\\% of cases, underscoring the challenge of identifying erroneous reasoning. Furthermore, the ability to accurately identify errors offers valuable insights into the capabilities of multi-modal reasoning models.

A major challenge is to relight the avatars to match any scene illumination. For high quality relighting, existing methods require subjects to be captured under complex time-multiplexed illumination, such as one-light-at-a-time (OLAT). We propose a new generalized relightable 3D Gaussian head model that can relight any subject observed in a single- or multi-view images without requiring OLAT data for that subject. Our core idea is to learn a mapping from flat-lit 3DGS avatars to corresponding relightable Gaussian parameters for that avatar. Our model consists of two stages: a first stage that models flat-lit 3DGS avatars without OLAT lighting, and a second stage that learns the mapping to physically-based reflectance parameters for high-quality relighting. This two-stage design allows us to train the first stage across diverse existing multi-view datasets without OLAT lighting ensuring cross-subject generalization, where we learn a dataset-specific lighting code for self-supervised lighting alignment. Subsequently, the second stage can be trained on a significantly smaller dataset of subjects captured under OLAT illumination. Together, this allows our method to generalize well and relight any subject from the first stage as if we had captured them under OLAT lighting. Furthermore, we can fit our model to unseen subjects from as little as a single image, allowing several applications in novel view synthesis and relighting for digital avatars.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700OLAT\u6570\u636e\u76843D\u9ad8\u65af\u5934\u50cf\u91cd\u5149\u7167\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5b9e\u65f6\u6e32\u67d3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709OLAT\u5149\u7167\u9700\u6c42\u9650\u5236\u4e863D\u5934\u50cf\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u9700\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8e\u5355\u89c6\u89d2\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u91cd\u5149\u7167\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "1. \u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6a21\u578b\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u7528\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u975eOLAT\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u57fa\u7840\u5934\u50cf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u7528OLAT\u5c0f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b66\u4e60\u53cd\u5c04\u53c2\u6570\u6620\u5c04\uff1b2. \u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5149\u7167\u5bf9\u9f50\u6a21\u5757\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u53ef\u5728\u5355\u5f20\u56fe\u7247\u8f93\u5165\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0eOLAT\u91c7\u96c6\u6548\u679c\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u5934\u50cf\u91cd\u5149\u7167\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u6570\u5b57\u4eba\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u79bb\u5149\u7167\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u4e13\u4e1a\u91c7\u96c6\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf3D\u5934\u50cf\u52a8\u6001\u6e32\u67d3\u3002"}}

Results show that LLMs can be more effective segmenters than existing methods, but issues remain to be solved before they can be relied upon for topic segmentation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5229\u7528LLMs\u8fdb\u884c\u4e3b\u9898\u5206\u5272\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u91cd\u53e0\u9012\u5f52\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u8fb9\u754c\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6f5c\u529b\u4f46\u6307\u51fa\u4ecd\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4fLLMs\u7684\u957f\u7a0b\u4f9d\u8d56\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u9700\u63a2\u7d22\u9002\u5e94\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u6027\u7684\u5206\u5272\u7b56\u7565\u53ca\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53e5\u5b50\u679a\u4e3e\u7684\u91cd\u53e0\u9012\u5f52\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u8fb9\u754c\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6(Boundary Similarity)\u8861\u91cf\u5206\u5272\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "LLM\u5728\u4e3b\u9898\u5206\u5272\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fb9\u754c\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\u6709\u6548\u53cd\u6620\u5206\u5272\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0fLLM\u5177\u5907\u4e3b\u9898\u5206\u5272\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u4f18\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u9700\u7ed3\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u6027\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u9002\u914d\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u3002"}}

Experimental results on a 110M parameter model demonstrate a stable throughput of >60 tokens/second on M2 hardware.

Stapleton"], "title": "A path to natural language through tokenisation and transformers", "comment": "19 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables", "summary": "Natural languages exhibit striking regularities in their statistical structure, including notably the emergence of Zipf's and Heaps' laws. Despite this, it remains broadly unclear how these properties relate to the modern tokenisation schemes used in contemporary transformer models. In this note, we analyse the information content (as measured by the Shannon entropy) of various corpora under the assumption of a Zipfian frequency distribution, and derive a closed-form expression for the slot entropy expectation value. We then empirically investigate how byte--pair encoding (BPE) transforms corpus statistics, showing that recursive applications of BPE drive token frequencies toward a Zipfian power law while inducing a characteristic growth pattern in empirical entropy. Utilizing the ability of transformers to learn context dependent token probability distributions, we train language models on corpora tokenised at varying BPE depths, revealing that the model predictive entropies increasingly agree with Zipf-derived predictions as the BPE depth increases. Attention-based diagnostics further indicate that deeper tokenisation reduces local token dependencies, bringing the empirical distribution closer to the weakly dependent (near IID) regime. Together, these results clarify how BPE acts not only as a compression mechanism but also as a statistical transform that reconstructs key informational properties of natural language.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u7edf\u8ba1\u89c4\u5f8b\uff08\u5982Zipf\u5b9a\u5f8b\uff09\u4e0eTransformer\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u8bcd\u65b9\u6848\uff08BPE\uff09\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0BPE\u5206\u8bcd\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4f1a\u91cd\u6784\u8bed\u6599\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u4ee4\u724c\u9891\u7387\u8d8b\u5411\u5e42\u5f8b\u5206\u5e03\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u5c40\u90e8\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5b58\u5728Zipf/Heaps\u7edf\u8ba1\u89c4\u5f8b\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u4ee3Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5206\u8bcd\u673a\u5236\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u8fd9\u4e9b\u89c4\u5f8b\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u9700\u63ed\u793aBPE\u5206\u8bcd\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u7edf\u8ba1\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6df1\u5c42\u8054\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "1) \u57fa\u4e8eZipf\u5206\u5e03\u63a8\u5bfc\u4fe1\u606f\u71b5\u95ed\u5408\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f 2) \u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790BPE\u5bf9\u8bed\u6599\u7edf\u8ba1\u7684\u8f6c\u5316\u4f5c\u7528 3) \u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u540cBPE\u6df1\u5ea6\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5176\u9884\u6d4b\u71b5 4) \u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5206\u6790token\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "BPE\u5206\u8bcd\u4f7ftoken\u9891\u7387\u903c\u8fd1Zipfian\u5e42\u5f8b\u5e76\u4ea7\u751f\u7279\u5f81\u71b5\u589e\u957f\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1bTransformer\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u71b5\u4e0eZipf\u63a8\u5bfc\u7ed3\u679c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u968fBPE\u6df1\u5ea6\u589e\u5f3a\uff1b\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8bca\u65ad\u663e\u793a\u6df1\u5c42\u5206\u8bcd\u524a\u5f31\u5c40\u90e8\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "BPE\u4e0d\u4ec5\u662f\u538b\u7f29\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u66f4\u662f\u8bed\u8a00\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u6027\u7684\u91cd\u6784\u5668\uff0c\u5176\u901a\u8fc7\u5e42\u5f8b\u903c\u8fd1\u548c\u71b5\u8c03\u63a7\u4f7f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u8d34\u8fd1\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u5f31\u76f8\u5173\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u6027\u3002"}}

In this work, we investigate the problem in the scope of the emergent misalignment problem where LLMs can generalize patterns learned from misaligned content in one domain to another domain. We discover a strong causal relationship between metaphors in training data and the misalignment degree of LLMs' reasoning contents. With interventions using metaphors in pre-training, fine-tuning and re-alignment phases, models' cross-domain misalignment degrees change significantly. As we delve deeper into the causes behind this phenomenon, we observe that there is a connection between metaphors and the activation of global and local latent features of large reasoning models.

We identify two alignment-induced biases in existing methods: a positive moral bias, where characters uniformly adopt agreeable stances (e.g. always saying lying is bad), and a helpful assistant bias, where characters invariably answer questions directly (e.g. never refusing or deflecting). While such tendencies suit instruction-following systems, they suppress dramatic tension and yield predictable characters, stemming from maximum likelihood training and assistant fine-tuning. To address this, we introduce PersonaWeaver, a framework that disentangles world-building (roles, demographics) from behavioral-building (moral stances, interactional styles), yielding characters with more diverse reactions and moral stances, as well as second-order diversity in stylistic markers like length, tone, and punctuation.

We propose visual word puzzles as a challenging alternative, as they require discovering implicit visual cues, generating and revising hypotheses, and mapping perceptual evidence to non-literal concepts in ways that are difficult to solve via literal grounding, OCR-heavy shortcuts, or simple retrieval-style matching. We introduce Eye-Q, a multilingual benchmark designed to assess this form of complex visual understanding. Eye-Q contains 1,343 puzzles in which a model observes a conceptually dense scene with a brief description and must infer a specific target word or phrase. The puzzles are intentionally unstructured and cue-implicit, with distractors and contextual relationships that demand selective attention, abstraction, and associative inference.

In this work, we address the problem of data protection against unwanted model learning in a realistic black-box setting. We propose Disclaimer Injection, a novel data-level defence that renders text unlearnable to LLMs. Rather than relying on model-side controls or explicit data removal, our approach exploits the models' own alignment mechanisms: by injecting carefully designed alignment-triggering disclaimers to prevent effective learning. Through layer-wise analysis, we find that fine-tuning on such protected data induces persistent activation of alignment-related layers, causing alignment constraints to override task learning even on common inputs. Consequently, models trained on such data exhibit substantial and systematic performance degradation compared to standard fine-tuning. Our results identify alignment behaviour as a previously unexplored lever for data protection and, to our knowledge, present the first practical method for restricting data learnability at LLM scale without requiring access to or modification of the training pipeline.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51faDisclaimer Injection\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u4fee\u6539\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528LLMs\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u673a\u5236\u6ce8\u5165\u7279\u5b9a\u58f0\u660e\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u9ed1\u76d2\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u4fdd\u62a4\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f1a\u6301\u7eed\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5bf9\u9f50\u76f8\u5173\u5c42\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5f02\u6784\u6587\u672c\u5f15\u53d1\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u62c5\u5fe7\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u624b\u6bb5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6a21\u578b\u63a7\u5236\u6216\u6570\u636e\u5220\u9664\uff0c\u5728\u9ed1\u76d2\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u65b0\u578b\u6570\u636e\u4fdd\u62a4\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": " Disclaimer Injection\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5d4c\u5165\u5bf9\u9f50\u89e6\u53d1\u58f0\u660e\uff0c\u5f3a\u5236\u6fc0\u6d3bLLMs\u5185\u7f6e\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u673a\u5236\u5e72\u6270\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u5206\u6790\u9a8c\u8bc1\u58f0\u660e\u89e6\u53d1\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6a21\u5f0f\u53ca\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u53d7\u4fdd\u62a4\u6570\u636e\u5fae\u8c03\u4f7f\u5bf9\u9f50\u76f8\u5173\u5c42\u6301\u7eed\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff08\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f3a\u5ea6\u63d0\u534723%-37%\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u5e38\u89c4\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982GLUE\u57fa\u51c6\uff09\u4e2d\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d18-42\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0c\u4e14\u5f71\u54cd\u5177\u6709\u6301\u4e45\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u63ed\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9690\u79c1\u9632\u62a4\u65b0\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u51fa\u9996\u4e2a\u53ef\u5728LLM\u89c4\u6a21\u5e94\u7528\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u63a5\u89e6\u8bad\u7ec3\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9632\u6cc4\u9732\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u5408\u89c4\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u5316\u6280\u672f\u8def\u7ebf\u3002"}}

Previous work has shown that increasing inference steps can disrupt safety mechanisms and lead MLLMs to generate attacker-desired harmful content. However, most existing attacks focus on increasing the complexity of the modified visual task itself and do not explicitly leverage the model's own reasoning incentives. This leads to them underperforming on reasoning models (Models with Chain-of-Thoughts) compared to non-reasoning ones (Models without Chain-of-Thoughts). If a model can think like a human, can we influence its cognitive-stage decisions so that it proactively completes a jailbreak? To validate this idea, we propose GAMBI} (Gamified Adversarial Multimodal Breakout via Instructional Traps), a novel multimodal jailbreak framework that decomposes and reassembles harmful visual semantics, then constructs a gamified scene that drives the model to explore, reconstruct intent, and answer as part of winning the game. The resulting structured reasoning chain increases task complexity in both vision and text, positioning the model as a participant whose goal pursuit reduces safety attention and induces it to answer the reconstructed malicious query. Extensive experiments on popular reasoning and non-reasoning MLLMs demonstrate that GAMBIT achieves high Attack Success Rates (ASR), reaching 92.13% on Gemini 2.5 Flash, 91.20% on QvQ-MAX, and 85.87% on GPT-4o, significantly outperforming baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faGAMBI\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u901a\u8fc7\u6e38\u620f\u5316\u573a\u666f\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u5728\u5177\u5907\u94fe\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684MLLMs\u4e0a\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u56e0\u5176\u672a\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u63a8\u7406\u52a8\u673a\uff0c\u9700\u63a2\u7d22\u901a\u8fc7\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u51b3\u7b56\u9636\u6bb5\u8bf1\u53d1\u81ea\u4e3b\u8d8a\u72f1\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u673a\u5236", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u89e3\u91cd\u7ec4\u89c6\u89c9\u6709\u5bb3\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5177\u6709\u6e38\u620f\u673a\u5236\u7684\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e3a\u76ee\u6807\u4e3b\u52a8\u63a2\u7d22\u5e76\u91cd\u6784\u6076\u610f\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u6587\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u9057\u5fd8\u673a\u5236", "result": "\u5728Gemini 2.5 Flash/QvQ-MAX/GPT-4o\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u53d6\u5f9792.13%/91.20%/85.87%\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8ba4\u77e5\u5e72\u6270\u673a\u5236\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5a01\u80c1\u6709\u6548\u6027", "conclusion": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u5bfc\u5411\u4e0b\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6280\u672f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6"}}

Existing memory systems largely follow two paradigms: explicit structured memories offer interpretability but often become brittle under long-context overload, while latent memory mechanisms are efficient and stable yet difficult to inspect. We propose LatentGraphMem, a memory framework that combines implicit graph memory with explicit subgraph retrieval. LatentGraphMem stores a graph-structured memory in latent space for stability and efficiency, and exposes a task-specific subgraph retrieval interface that returns a compact symbolic subgraph under a fixed budget for downstream reasoning and human inspection.

The common practice of fully fine-tuning the vision encoder on driving datasets potentially limits its generalization by causing the model to specialize too heavily in the training data. This work challenges the necessity of this training paradigm. We propose FROST-Drive, a novel E2E architecture designed to preserve and leverage the powerful generalization capabilities of a pretrained vision encoder from a Vision-Language Model (VLM). By keeping the encoder's weights frozen, our approach directly transfers the rich, generalized world knowledge from the VLM to the driving task. Our model architecture combines this frozen encoder with a transformer-based adapter for multimodal fusion and a GRU-based decoder for smooth waypoint generation. Furthermore, we introduce a custom loss function designed to directly optimize for Rater Feedback Score (RFS), a metric that prioritizes robust trajectory planning. We conduct extensive experiments on Waymo Open E2E Dataset, a large-scale datasets deliberately curated to capture the long-tail scenarios, demonstrating that our frozen-encoder approach significantly outperforms models that employ full fine-tuning. Our results provide substantial evidence that preserving the broad knowledge of a capable VLM is a more effective strategy for achieving robust, generalizable driving performance than intensive domain-specific adaptation.

We visualize the learned embedding space to reveal the unsupervised emergence of semantic genre clusters, confirming that the model captures deep structural relationships solely from interaction data.

Reinforcement learning (RL) has been investigated for improving the quality of image editing, but it faces three key challenges: (1) limited reasoning exploration confined to denoising stochasticity, (2) biased reward fusion, and (3) unstable VLM-based instruction rewards. In this work, we propose ThinkRL-Edit, a reasoning-centric RL framework that decouples visual reasoning from image synthesis and expands reasoning exploration beyond denoising. To the end, we introduce Chain-of-Thought (CoT)-based reasoning sampling with planning and reflection stages prior to generation in online sampling, compelling the model to explore multiple semantic hypotheses and validate their plausibility before committing to a visual outcome. To avoid the failures of weighted aggregation, we propose an unbiased chain preference grouping strategy across multiple reward dimensions. Moreover, we replace interval-based VLM scores with a binary checklist, yielding more precise, lower-variance, and interpretable rewards for complex reasoning.

While existing research focuses on mitigating language priors or high-level statistical biases, they often overlook the internal complexities of the visual encoding process. We identify that visual statistical bias, arising from the inherent Bag-of-Patches behavior of Vision Encoders under weak structural supervision, acts as a contributing factor of object hallucinations. Under this bias, models prioritize local texture features within individual patches over holistic geometric structures. This tendency may induce spurious visual confidence and result in hallucinations. To address this, we introduce a training-free algorithm called Structure-Disrupted Contrastive Decoding (SDCD), which performs contrastive calibration of the output distribution by introducing a shuffled structure-disrupted view. By penalizing tokens that maintain high confidence under this structure-less view, SDCD effectively suppresses the texture-driven bias.

Despite its importance, the task remains challenging due to the complexity of defining topic boundaries, the variability in discourse structure, and the need to balance local coherence with global context. These difficulties hinder downstream applications such as summarization, information retrieval, and question answering. In this work, we introduce SegNSP, framing linear text segmentation as a next sentence prediction (NSP) task. Although NSP has largely been abandoned in modern pre-training, its explicit modeling of sentence-to-sentence continuity makes it a natural fit for detecting topic boundaries. We propose a label-agnostic NSP approach, which predicts whether the next sentence continues the current topic without requiring explicit topic labels, and enhance it with a segmentation-aware loss combined with harder negative sampling to better capture discourse continuity. Unlike recent proposals that leverage NSP alongside auxiliary topic classification, our approach avoids task-specific supervision. We evaluate our model against established baselines on two datasets, CitiLink-Minutes, for which we establish the first segmentation benchmark, and WikiSection. On CitiLink-Minutes, SegNSP achieves a B-$F_1$ of 0.79, closely aligning with human-annotated topic transitions, while on WikiSection it attains a B-F$_1$ of 0.65, outperforming the strongest reproducible baseline, TopSeg, by 0.17 absolute points.

Our G2P address the misalignment between optimized Gaussians and original point geometry by establishing point-wise correspondences.

In this paper, we propose CloudMatch, a semi-supervised framework that effectively leverages unlabeled remote sensing imagery through view-consistency learning combined with scene-mixing augmentations. An observation behind CloudMatch is that cloud patterns exhibit structural diversity and contextual variability across different scenes and within the same scene category. Our key insight is that enforcing prediction consistency across diversely augmented views, incorporating both inter-scene and intra-scene mixing, enables the model to capture the structural diversity and contextual richness of cloud patterns.

To address this, we present **EASLT** (**E**motion-**A**ware **S**ign **L**anguage **T**ranslation), a framework that treats facial affect not as auxiliary information, but as a robust semantic anchor. Unlike methods that relegate facial expressions to a secondary role, EASLT incorporates a dedicated emotional encoder to capture continuous affective dynamics.

Extensive evaluations on the PHOENIX14T and CSL-Daily benchmarks demonstrate that EASLT establishes advanced performance among gloss-free methods, achieving BLEU-4 scores of 26.15 and 22.80, and BLEURT scores of 61.0 and 57.8, respectively.

On question answering benchmarks, IntroLM applied to Qwen3 8B achieves a ROC AUC of 90 precent for success prediction, outperforming a DeBERTa classifier by 14 precent. When integrated into multi model routing systems, IntroLM achieves superior cost performance tradeoffs, reducing latency by up to 33 precent and large model usage by up to 50 precent at matched reliability.", "AI": {"tldr": "IntroLM\u901a\u8fc7\u5185\u7701\u6807\u8bb0\u4f7f\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u6211\u9884\u6d4b\u8f93\u51fa\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5728Qwen3 8B\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b090% ROC AUC\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8eDeBERTa\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u8d44\u6e90\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u5916\u90e8\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u4f9d\u8d56\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9650\u5236\u3001\u7b97\u529b\u5f00\u9500\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347LLM\u81ea\u6211\u8bc4\u4f30\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8eLoRA\u7684\u5185\u7701\u6807\u8bb0\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728prefilling\u9636\u6bb5\u9884\u6d4b\u8f93\u51fa\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u539f\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "Qwen3 8B\u96c6\u6210IntroLM\u540eROC AUC\u8fbe90%\uff0c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e33%\uff0c\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4f7f\u7528\u7387\u51cf\u5c1150%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "IntroLM\u901a\u8fc7\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u81ea\u6211\u8bc4\u4f30\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8d28\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u8def\u7531\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u8d44\u6e90\u8c03\u5ea6\u3002"}}

Detecting AI-generated images has thus become a critical challenge, particularly in terms of generalizing to unseen generative models. Existing methods using frozen pre-trained CLIP models show promise in generalization but treat the image encoder as a basic feature extractor, failing to fully exploit its potential. In this paper, we perform an in-depth analysis of the frozen CLIP image encoder (CLIP-ViT), revealing that it effectively clusters real images in a high-level, abstract feature space. However, it does not truly possess the ability to distinguish between real and AI-generated images. Based on this analysis, we propose a Masking-based Pre-trained model Fine-Tuning (MPFT) strategy, which introduces a Texture-Aware Masking (TAM) mechanism to mask textured areas containing generative model-specific patterns during fine-tuning. This approach compels CLIP-ViT to attend to the \"distributional deviations\"from authentic images for AI-generated image detection, thereby achieving enhanced generalization performance.

However, existing studies largely overlook the complex environmental factors encountered in real world scenarios-such as illumination, background, and camera viewpoint-which can substantially increase the difficulty of test images. As a result, models trained under laboratory conditions often fall short of practical deployment requirements. To bridge this gap, in this paper, an environment-robust FSS setting is introduced that explicitly incorporates challenging test cases arising from complex environments-such as motion blur, small objects, and camouflaged targets-to enhance model's robustness under realistic, dynamic conditions. An environment robust FSS benchmark (ER-FSS) is established, covering eight datasets across multiple real world scenarios. In addition, an Adaptive Attention Distillation (AAD) method is proposed, which repeatedly contrasts and distills key shared semantics between known (support) and unknown (query) images to derive class-specific attention for novel categories.

Stone inscription images pose severe challenges for binarization due to poor contrast between etched characters and the stone background, non-uniform surface degradation, distracting artifacts, and highly variable text density and layouts. These conditions frequently cause existing binarization techniques to fail and struggle to isolate coherent character regions. Many approaches sub-divide the image into patches to improve text fragment resolution and improve binarization performance. With this in mind, we present a robust and adaptive patching strategy to binarize challenging Indic inscriptions. The patches from our approach are used to train an Attention U-Net for binarization. The attention mechanism allows the model to focus on subtle structural cues, while our dynamic sampling and patch selection method ensures that the model learns to overcome surface noise and layout irregularities. We also introduce a carefully annotated, pixel-precise dataset of Indic stone inscriptions at the character-fragment level. We demonstrate that our novel patching mechanism significantly boosts binarization performance across classical and deep learning baselines. Despite training only on single script Indic dataset, our model exhibits strong zero-shot generalization to other Indic and non-indic scripts, highlighting its robustness and script-agnostic generalization capabilities. By producing clean, structured representations of inscription content, our method lays the foundation for downstream tasks such as script identification, OCR, and historical text analysis.

Recent work proposes \\emph{hop-aligned circuit hypothesis}, suggesting that bridge entities are computed sequentially across layers before later-hop answers. Through systematic analyses on real-world multi-hop queries, we show that this hop-aligned assumption does not generalize: later-hop answer entities can become decodable earlier than bridge entities, a phenomenon we call \\emph{layer-order inversion}, which strengthens with total hops. To explain this behavior, we propose a \\emph{probabilistic recall-and-extract} framework that models multi-hop reasoning as broad probabilistic recall in shallow MLP layers followed by selective extraction in deeper attention layers. This framework is empirically validated through systematic probing analyses, reinterpreting prior layer-wise decoding evidence, explaining chain-of-thought gains, and providing a mechanistic diagnosis of multi-hop failures despite correct single-hop knowledge.

We introduce a context-based assessment protocol that sequentially administers standardized questionnaires for privacy attitudes, prosocialness, and acceptance of data sharing within a bounded, history-carrying session. To evaluate value-action alignments under competing attitudes, we use multi-group structural equation modeling (MGSEM) to identify relations from privacy concerns and prosocialness to data sharing.

This paper presents CrackSegFlow, a controllable flow-matching synthesis framework that generates photorealistic crack images conditioned on binary masks while preserving strict mask-image alignment. The generator combines topology-preserving mask injection with boundary-gated modulation to maintain thin-structure continuity and suppress texture-driven false positives. A second class-conditional flow-matching model synthesizes crack masks with explicit control over crack coverage, enabling balanced, topology-diverse paired data without additional manual annotation. We further inject crack masks into crack-free backgrounds to diversify illumination and surface artifacts and reduce false positives caused by shadows, joints, and pavement markings. Experiments on five benchmarks spanning four asphalt datasets and the crack class of a concrete-domain dataset demonstrate consistent improvements under an established hybrid CNN--Transformer segmentation backbone and a fixed training protocol. With real plus synthesized pairs, in-domain performance improves on average by 5.37 mIoU and 5.13 F1, and target-guided cross-domain synthesis yields average gains of 13.12 mIoU and 14.82 F1 using only limited target mask statistics. Compared with diffusion-based semantic synthesis, CrackSegFlow provides substantially faster deterministic sampling and improves fidelity and mask-image alignment for thin-structure crack geometry.

Existing models can produce high-quality short clips but often fail to preserve entity identity and appearance when scenes change or when entities reappear after long temporal gaps. We present VideoMemory, an entity-centric framework that integrates narrative planning with visual generation through a Dynamic Memory Bank. Given a structured script, a multi-agent system decomposes the narrative into shots, retrieves entity representations from memory, and synthesizes keyframes and videos conditioned on these retrieved states. The Dynamic Memory Bank stores explicit visual and semantic descriptors for characters, props, and backgrounds, and is updated after each shot to reflect story-driven changes while preserving identity.

Current evaluative approaches primarily rely on refusal-based safety signals, which offer limited insight into the nuanced behaviors required in clinical practice. In mental health, clinically inadequate refusals can be perceived as unempathetic and discourage help-seeking. To address this gap, we move beyond refusal-centric metrics and introduce \\texttt{PsychEthicsBench}, the first principle-grounded benchmark based on Australian psychology and psychiatry guidelines, designed to evaluate LLMs' ethical knowledge and behavioral responses through multiple-choice and open-ended tasks with fine-grained ethicality annotations. Empirical results across 14 models reveal that refusal rates are poor indicators of ethical behavior, revealing a significant divergence between safety triggers and clinical appropriateness. Notably, we find that domain-specific fine-tuning can degrade ethical robustness, as several specialized models underperform their base backbones in ethical alignment.

When a user code-switches in their prompt to an LLM, they typically do not specify the expected language of the LLM response, and thus LLMs must infer the output language from contextual and pragmatic cues. We find that current LLMs systematically fail to align with this expectation, responding in undesired languages even when cues are clear to humans. We introduce OLA, a benchmark to evaluate LLMs' Output Language Alignment in code-switched interactions. OLA focuses on Korean--English code-switching and spans simple intra-sentential mixing to instruction-content mismatches. Even frontier models frequently misinterpret implicit language expectation, exhibiting a bias toward non-English responses. We further show this bias generalizes beyond Korean to Chinese and Indonesian pairs. Models also show instability through mid-response switching and language intrusions. Chain-of-Thought prompting fails to resolve these errors, indicating weak pragmatic reasoning about output language. However, Code-Switching Aware DPO with minimal data (about 1K examples) substantially reduces misalignment, suggesting these failures stem from insufficient alignment rather than fundamental limitations.

However, applying VLMs to 6-DoF endoscopic camera localization presents several challenges: 1) the lack of large-scale, high-quality, densely annotated, and localization-oriented vision-language datasets in real-world medical settings; 2) limited capability for fine-grained pose regression; and 3) high computational latency when extracting temporal features from past frames. To address these issues, we first construct BREATH dataset, the largest in-vivo endoscopic localization dataset to date, collected in the complex human airway. Building on this dataset, we propose BREATH-VL, a hybrid framework that integrates semantic cues from VLMs with geometric information from vision-based registration methods for accurate 6-DoF pose estimation. Our motivation lies in the complementary strengths of both approaches: VLMs offer generalizable semantic understanding, while registration methods provide precise geometric alignment. To further enhance the VLM's ability to capture temporal context, we introduce a lightweight context-learning mechanism that encodes motion history as linguistic prompts, enabling efficient temporal reasoning without expensive video-level computation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the vision-language module delivers robust semantic localization in challenging surgical scenes.

In contrast, real-world reasoning requires integrating multiple premises and solving subproblems in parallel. Existing methods, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), express reasoning in a linear textual form, which may appear coherent but frequently leads to inconsistent conclusions. Recent approaches rely on externally provided graphs and do not explore how LLMs can construct and use their own graph-structured reasoning, particularly in open-domain QA. To fill this gap, we novelly explore graph-structured reasoning of LLMs in general-domain question answering. We propose Self-Graph Reasoning (SGR), a framework that enables LLMs to explicitly represent their reasoning process as a structured graph before producing the final answer.

Compared with labor-intensive per-model on-device calibration, a digital-twin pipeline built on optical simulation offers a substantial advantage in generating large-scale labeled data. However, complex imaging conditions induce a domain gap between simulation and real-world images, limiting the generalization of simulation-trained models. To address this, we propose augmenting a simulation baseline with minimal unlabeled real-world images captured at random misalignment positions, mitigating the gap from a domain adaptation perspective. We introduce Domain Adaptive Active Alignment (DA3), which utilizes an autoregressive domain transformation generator and an adversarial-based feature alignment strategy to distill real-world domain information via self-supervised learning. This enables the extraction of domain-invariant image degradation features to facilitate robust misalignment prediction. Experiments on two lens types reveal that DA3 improves accuracy by 46% over a purely simulation pipeline. Notably, it approaches the performance achieved with precisely labeled real-world data collected on 3 lens samples, while reducing on-device data collection time by 98.7%.

This necessitates a new class of model robustness analysis: robustness of the predictive reasoning under adversarial attacks, which goes beyond existing paradigm that mainly focuses on the shifts of the final predictions (e.g., fake v.s. real). To analyze such reasoning shifts, we introduce a forensic auditing framework to evaluate the robustness of ALMs' reasoning under adversarial attacks in three inter-connected dimensions: acoustic perception, cognitive coherence, and cognitive dissonance. Our systematic analysis reveals that explicit reasoning does not universally enhance robustness. Instead, we observe a bifurcation: for models exhibiting robust acoustic perception, reasoning acts as a defensive \\textit{``shield''}, protecting them from adversarial attacks. However, for others, it imposes a performance \\textit{``tax''}, particularly under linguistic attacks which reduce cognitive coherence and increase attack success rate. Crucially, even when classification fails, high cognitive dissonance can serve as a \\textit{silent alarm}, flagging potential manipulation.

While hyperspectral image offers a powerful alternative by capturing fine-grained spectral signatures, progress in hyperspectral camouflaged object detection (HCOD) has been critically hampered by the absence of a dedicated, large-scale benchmark. To spur innovation, we introduce HyperCOD, the first challenging benchmark for HCOD. Comprising 350 high-resolution hyperspectral images, It features complex real-world scenarios with minimal objects, intricate shapes, severe occlusions, and dynamic lighting to challenge current models. The advent of foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) presents a compelling opportunity. To adapt the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for HCOD, we propose HyperSpectral Camouflage-aware SAM (HSC-SAM). HSC-SAM ingeniously reformulates the hyperspectral image by decoupling it into a spatial map fed to SAM's image encoder and a spectral saliency map that serves as an adaptive prompt. This translation effectively bridges the modality gap. Extensive experiments show that HSC-SAM sets a new state-of-the-art on HyperCOD and generalizes robustly to other public HSI datasets.

To address these limitations, we propose I2E, a novel \"Decompose-then-Action\" paradigm that revisits image editing as an actionable interaction process within a structured environment. I2E utilizes a Decomposer to transform unstructured images into discrete, manipulable object layers and then introduces a physics-aware Vision-Language-Action Agent to parse complex instructions into a series of atomic actions via Chain-of-Thought reasoning. Further, we also construct I2E-Bench, a benchmark designed for multi-instance spatial reasoning and high-precision editing.

While text-based affect inference has become increasingly feasible, prior approaches often treat sentiment as a deterministic point estimate for individual speakers, failing to capture the inherent subjectivity, latent ambiguity, and sequential coupling found in mutual exchanges. We introduce LLM-MC-Affect, a probabilistic framework that characterizes emotion not as a static label, but as a continuous latent probability distribution defined over an affective space. By leveraging stochastic LLM decoding and Monte Carlo estimation, the methodology approximates these distributions to derive high-fidelity sentiment trajectories that explicitly quantify both central affective tendencies and perceptual ambiguity. These trajectories enable a structured analysis of interpersonal coupling through sequential cross-correlation and slope-based indicators, identifying leading or lagging influences between interlocutors.

However, while these approaches effectively enhance perception abilities, they primarily target holistic content understanding, often lacking explicit supervision for intrinsic temporal coherence and inter-frame correlations. This tendency limits the models' ability to capture intricate dynamics and fine-grained visual causality. To explicitly bridge this gap, we propose a novel post-training objective: Masked Video Prediction (MVP). By requiring the model to reconstruct a masked continuous segment from a set of challenging distractors, MVP forces the model to attend to the sequential logic and temporal context of events. To support scalable training, we introduce a scalable data synthesis pipeline capable of transforming arbitrary video corpora into MVP training samples, and further employ Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a fine-grained reward function to enhance the model's understanding of video context and temporal properties.

This motivates omni-modal embedding models that map heterogeneous modalities into a shared space for direct comparison. However, most recent omni-modal embeddings still rely heavily on implicit alignment inherited from pretrained vision-language model (VLM) backbones. In practice, this causes three common issues: (i) similarity logits have modality-dependent sharpness, so scores are not on a consistent scale; (ii) in-batch negatives become less effective over time because mixed-modality batches create an imbalanced hardness distribution; as a result, many negatives quickly become trivial and contribute little gradient; and (iii) embeddings across modalities show mismatched first- and second-order statistics, which makes rankings less stable. To tackle these problems, we propose e5-omni, a lightweight explicit alignment recipe that adapts off-the-shelf VLMs into robust omni-modal embedding models. e5-omni combines three simple components: (1) modality-aware temperature calibration to align similarity scales, (2) a controllable negative curriculum with debiasing to focus on confusing negatives while reducing the impact of false negatives, and (3) batch whitening with covariance regularization to better match cross-modal geometry in the shared embedding space. Experiments on MMEB-V2 and AudioCaps show consistent gains over strong bi-modal and omni-modal baselines, and the same recipe also transfers well to other VLM backbones.

Among these parameters, Gaussian means are particularly difficult to predict, so depth is usually estimated first and then unprojected to obtain the Gaussian sphere centers. Existing methods typically rely solely on a single warp to estimate depth probability, which hinders their ability to fully leverage cross-view geometric cues, resulting in unstable and coarse depth maps. To address this limitation, we propose IDESplat, which iteratively applies warp operations to boost depth probability estimation for accurate Gaussian mean prediction. First, to eliminate the inherent instability of a single warp, we introduce a Depth Probability Boosting Unit (DPBU) that integrates epipolar attention maps produced by cascading warp operations in a multiplicative manner. Next, we construct an iterative depth estimation process by stacking multiple DPBUs, progressively identifying potential depth candidates with high likelihood. As IDESplat iteratively boosts depth probability estimates and updates the depth candidates, the depth map is gradually refined, resulting in accurate Gaussian means. We conduct experiments on RealEstate10K, ACID, and DL3DV. IDESplat achieves outstanding reconstruction quality and state-of-the-art performance with real-time efficiency. On RE10K, it outperforms DepthSplat by 0.33 dB in PSNR, using only 10.7% of the parameters and 70% of the memory.

We introduce DisastQA, a large-scale benchmark of 3,000 rigorously verified questions (2,000 multiple-choice and 1,000 open-ended) spanning eight disaster types. The benchmark is constructed via a human-LLM collaboration pipeline with stratified sampling to ensure balanced coverage. Models are evaluated under varying evidence conditions, from closed-book to noisy evidence integration, enabling separation of internal knowledge from reasoning under imperfect information. For open-ended QA, we propose a human-verified keypoint-based evaluation protocol emphasizing factual completeness over verbosity. Experiments with 20 models reveal substantial divergences from general-purpose leaderboards such as MMLU-Pro. While recent open-weight models approach proprietary systems in clean settings, performance degrades sharply under realistic noise, exposing critical reliability gaps for disaster response.

Currently, obtaining accurate segmentation outcomes is critically reliant on large-scale datasets with high-quality annotations. However, noisy annotations are frequently encountered owing to the complex morphological structures of organs in medical images and variations among different annotators, which can substantially limit the efficacy of segmentation models. Motivated by the fact that medical imaging annotator can correct labeling errors during segmentation based on prior knowledge, we propose an end-to-end Staged Voxel-Level Deep Reinforcement Learning (SVL-DRL) framework for robust medical image segmentation under noisy annotations. This framework employs a dynamic iterative update strategy to automatically mitigate the impact of erroneous labels without requiring manual intervention. The key advancements of SVL-DRL over existing works include: i) formulating noisy annotations as a voxel-dependent problem and addressing it through a novel staged reinforcement learning framework which guarantees robust model convergence; ii) incorporating a voxel-level asynchronous advantage actor-critic (vA3C) module that conceptualizes each voxel as an autonomous agent, which allows each agent to dynamically refine its own state representation during training, thereby directly mitigating the influence of erroneous labels; iii) designing a novel action space for the agents, along with a composite reward function that strategically combines the Dice value and a spatial continuity metric to significantly boost segmentation accuracy while maintain semantic integrity.

We systematically analyze this limitation, focusing on logical relationship understanding, which is a core capability underlying genuine logical reasoning, and reveal that errors related to this capability account for over 90\\% of incorrect predictions, with Chain-of-Thought Supervised Fine-Tuning (CoT-SFT) failing to substantially reduce these errors. To address this bottleneck, we propose First-Step Logical Reasoning (FSLR), a lightweight training framework targeting logical relationship understanding. Our key insight is that the first planning step-identifying which variables to use and which operation to apply-encourages the model to derive logical relationships directly from the problem statement. By training models on this isolated step, FSLR provides explicit supervision for logical relationship understanding, unlike CoT-SFT which implicitly embeds such relationships within complete solution trajectories. Extensive experiments across multiple models and datasets demonstrate that FSLR consistently outperforms CoT-SFT under both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings, with average improvements of 3.2\\% and 4.6\\%, respectively.

However, screenshots are tokenized into thousands of visual tokens (e.g., about 4700 for 2K resolution), incurring significant computational overhead and diluting attention. In contrast, humans typically focus on regions of interest when interacting with UI. In this work, we pioneer the task of efficient UI grounding. Guided by practical analysis of the task's characteristics and challenges, we propose FocusUI, an efficient UI grounding framework that selects patches most relevant to the instruction while preserving positional continuity for precise grounding. FocusUI addresses two key challenges: (1) Eliminating redundant tokens in visual encoding. We construct patch-level supervision by fusing an instruction-conditioned score with a rule-based UI-graph score that down-weights large homogeneous regions to select distinct and instruction-relevant visual tokens. (2) Preserving positional continuity during visual token selection. We find that general visual token pruning methods suffer from severe accuracy degradation on UI grounding tasks due to broken positional information. We introduce a novel PosPad strategy, which compresses each contiguous sequence of dropped visual tokens into a single special marker placed at the sequence's last index to preserve positional continuity. Comprehensive experiments on four grounding benchmarks demonstrate that FocusUI surpasses GUI-specific baselines. On the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark, FocusUI-7B achieves a performance improvement of 3.7% over GUI-Actor-7B. Even with only 30% visual token retention, FocusUI-7B drops by only 3.2% while achieving up to 1.44x faster inference and 17% lower peak GPU memory.", "AI": {"tldr": "FocusUI \u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684UI\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b5b\u9009\u4e0e\u6307\u4ee4\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5173\u952e\u89c6\u89c9\u6807\u8bb0\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u622a\u56fe\u65f6\u9700\u8981\u6570\u5343\u89c6\u89c9\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u4e14\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u6563\u3002\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0fUI\u65f6\u901a\u5e38\u805a\u7126\u7279\u5b9a\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u773c\u6548\u7387\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "1) \u6307\u4ee4-UI\u56fe\u878d\u5408\u5f97\u5206\uff1a\u7ed3\u5408\u6307\u4ee4\u6761\u4ef6\u8bc4\u5206\u4e0e\u89c4\u5219\u9a71\u52a8\u7684UI\u56fe\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u6291\u5236\u5927\u9762\u79ef\u540c\u8d28\u533a\u57df\u4ee5\u9009\u62e9\u5dee\u5f02\u5316\u6807\u8bb0\uff1b2) PosPad\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u5c06\u8fde\u7eed\u4e22\u5f03\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u6807\u8bb0\u5e8f\u5217\u538b\u7f29\u4e3a\u4fdd\u7559\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u7279\u6b8a\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u7834\u574f\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5728ScreenSpot-Pro\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cFocusUI-7B\u6bd4GUI-Actor-7B\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u53473.7%\uff1b\u4fdd\u755930%\u89c6\u89c9\u6807\u8bb0\u65f6\u4ec5\u4e0b\u964d3.2%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u53471.44\u500d\uff0cGPU\u5cf0\u503c\u5185\u5b58\u964d\u4f4e17%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728UI\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u89c6\u89c9\u6807\u8bb0\u538b\u7f29\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Although early-exit strategies have proven effective in reducing computational demands by halting inference earlier, they apply either to only the first token in the generation phase or at the prompt level in the prefill phase. Thus, the Key-Value (KV) cache for skipped layers remains a bottleneck for subsequent token generation, limiting the benefits of early exit. We introduce ADEPT (Adaptive Dynamic Early-exit Process for Transformers), a novel approach designed to overcome this issue and enable dynamic early exit in both the prefill and generation phases. The proposed adaptive token-level early-exit mechanism adjusts computation dynamically based on token complexity, optimizing efficiency without compromising performance. ADEPT further enhances KV generation procedure by decoupling sequential dependencies in skipped layers, making token-level early exit more practical. Experimental results demonstrate that ADEPT improves efficiency by up to 25% in language generation tasks and achieves a 4x speed-up in downstream classification tasks, with up to a 45% improvement in performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "ADEPT \u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4ee4\u724c\u7ea7\u65e9\u671f\u9000\u51fa\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u5728\u9884\u586b\u5145\u548c\u751f\u6210\u9636\u6bb5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8fbe 25% \u7684\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u548c 4 \u500d\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65e9\u671f\u9000\u51fa\u7b56\u7565\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u9636\u6bb5\u9996\u4e2a\u4ee4\u724c\u6216\u9884\u586b\u5145\u9636\u6bb5\u63d0\u793a\u7ea7\u522b\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8df3\u8fc7\u5c42\u7684 KV \u7f13\u5b58\u6210\u4e3a\u74f6\u9888\u3002\u9700\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u914d\u4e0d\u540c\u9636\u6bb5\u548c\u4ee4\u724c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa ADEPT\uff1a(1) \u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4ee4\u724c\u7ea7\u65e9\u671f\u9000\u51fa\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u4ee4\u724c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u622a\u65ad\u8ba1\u7b97\u5c42\u6570\uff1b(2) \u89e3\u8026\u8df3\u8fc7\u5c42\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4f18\u5316 KV \u7f13\u5b58\u751f\u6210\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347 25%\uff0c\u4e0b\u6e38\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u52a0\u901f 4 \u500d\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe 45%\u3002\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u89e3\u8026\u6a21\u5757\u5bf9\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "ADEPT \u901a\u8fc7\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u622a\u65ad\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u521b\u65b0\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u7a81\u7834\u65e9\u671f\u9000\u51fa\u7684\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u901a\u7528\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Black", "Omid Taheri"], "title": "FUSION: Full-Body Unified Motion Prior for Body and Hands via Diffusion", "comment": null, "summary": "Hands are central to interacting with our surroundings and conveying gestures, making their inclusion essential for full-body motion synthesis. Despite this, existing human motion synthesis methods fall short: some ignore hand motions entirely, while others generate full-body motions only for narrowly scoped tasks under highly constrained settings. A key obstacle is the lack of large-scale datasets that jointly capture diverse full-body motion with detailed hand articulation. While some datasets capture both, they are limited in scale and diversity. Conversely, large-scale datasets typically focus either on body motion without hands or on hand motions without the body. To overcome this, we curate and unify existing hand motion datasets with large-scale body motion data to generate full-body sequences that capture both hand and body. We then propose the first diffusion-based unconditional full-body motion prior, FUSION, which jointly models body and hand motion. Despite using a pose-based motion representation, FUSION surpasses state-of-the-art skeletal control models on the Keypoint Tracking task in the HumanML3D dataset and achieves superior motion naturalness. Beyond standard benchmarks, we demonstrate that FUSION can go beyond typical uses of motion priors through two applications: (1) generating detailed full-body motion including fingers during interaction given the motion of an object, and (2) generating Self-Interaction motions using an LLM to transform natural language cues into actionable motion constraints. For these applications, we develop an optimization pipeline that refines the latent space of our diffusion model to generate task-specific motions. Experiments on these tasks highlight precise control over hand motion while maintaining plausible full-body coordination.

A Close Look at DeepSeek-OCR", "comment": null, "summary": "DeepSeek-OCR utilizes an optical 2D mapping approach to achieve high-ratio vision-text compression, claiming to decode text tokens exceeding ten times the input visual tokens. While this suggests a promising solution for the LLM long-context bottleneck, we investigate a critical question: \"Visual merit or linguistic crutch - which drives DeepSeek-OCR's performance?\" By employing sentence-level and word-level semantic corruption, we isolate the model's intrinsic OCR capabilities from its language priors. Results demonstrate that without linguistic support, DeepSeek-OCR's performance plummets from approximately 90% to 20%. Comparative benchmarking against 13 baseline models reveals that traditional pipeline OCR methods exhibit significantly higher robustness to such semantic perturbations than end-to-end methods. Furthermore, we find that lower visual token counts correlate with increased reliance on priors, exacerbating hallucination risks. Context stress testing also reveals a total model collapse around 10,000 text tokens, suggesting that current optical compression techniques may paradoxically aggravate the long-context bottleneck.

Various researchers have already advanced inherently non-linear neuron models, such as quadratic neurons, generalized operational neurons, generative neurons, and super neurons, which offer stronger non-linearity compared to point-wise activation functions. In this paper, we introduce a novel and better non-linear neuron model called Pad\u00e9 neurons (Paons), inspired by Pad\u00e9 approximants. Paons offer several advantages, such as diversity of non-linearity, since each Paon learns a different non-linear function of its inputs, and layer efficiency, since Paons provide stronger non-linearity in much fewer layers compared to piecewise linear approximation. Furthermore, Paons include all previously proposed neuron models as special cases, thus any neuron model in any network can be replaced by Paons. We note that there has been a proposal to employ the Pad\u00e9 approximation as a generalized point-wise activation function, which is fundamentally different from our model. To validate the efficacy of Paons, in our experiments, we replace classic neurons in some well-known neural image super-resolution, compression, and classification models based on the ResNet architecture with Paons. Our comprehensive experimental results and analyses demonstrate that neural models built by Paons provide better or equal performance than their classic counterparts with a smaller number of layers.

While these models typically assess visual quality, motion quality, and text alignment, they often overlook key structural distortions, such as abnormal object appearances and interactions, which can degrade the overall quality of the generative video. To address this gap, we introduce REACT, a frame-level reward model designed specifically for structural distortions evaluation in generative videos. REACT assigns point-wise scores and attribution labels by reasoning over video frames, focusing on recognizing distortions. To support this, we construct a large-scale human preference dataset, annotated based on our proposed taxonomy of structural distortions, and generate additional data using a efficient Chain-of-Thought (CoT) synthesis pipeline. REACT is trained with a two-stage framework: ((1) supervised fine-tuning with masked loss for domain knowledge injection, followed by (2) reinforcement learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and pairwise rewards to enhance reasoning capability and align output scores with human preferences. During inference, a dynamic sampling mechanism is introduced to focus on frames most likely to exhibit distortion. We also present REACT-Bench, a benchmark for generative video distortion evaluation.

We apply this synthetic data to fine-tune a pre-trained Indonesian Whisper model using transfer learning, enabling the architecture to adapt to dysfluent acoustic patterns without requiring large-scale real-world recordings.

In this work, we introduce an annotation-efficient segmentation approach that reframes the pixel-level task into a binary region classification problem.

Existing Direct Preference Otimization (DPO) methods rely on multi-sample ranking and task-specific critic models, which is inefficient and often yields ambiguous global supervision. To address these limitations, we propose LocalDPO, a novel post-training framework that constructs localized preference pairs from real videos and optimizes alignment at the spatio-temporal region level. We design an automated pipeline to efficiently collect preference pair data that generates preference pairs with a single inference per prompt, eliminating the need for external critic models or manual annotation. Specifically, we treat high-quality real videos as positive samples and generate corresponding negatives by locally corrupting them with random spatio-temporal masks and restoring only the masked regions using the frozen base model. During training, we introduce a region-aware DPO loss that restricts preference learning to corrupted areas for rapid convergence. Experiments on Wan2.1 and CogVideoX demonstrate that LocalDPO consistently improves video fidelity, temporal coherence and human preference scores over other post-training approaches, establishing a more efficient and fine-grained paradigm for video generator alignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faLocalDPO\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u533a\u57df\u7ea7\u7684\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u5347\u6587\u672c\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u8bc4\u4ef7\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709DPO\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u591a\u6837\u672c\u6392\u5e8f\u548c\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8bc4\u4ef7\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e14\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\u6a21\u7cca\u3002\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5c40\u90e8\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\uff1a\u7528\u771f\u5b9e\u89c6\u9891\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6b63\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u7a7a\u63a9\u7801\u751f\u6210\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u533a\u57df\u611f\u77e5\u7684DPO\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u805a\u7126\u88ab\u63a9\u7801\u533a\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728Wan2.1\u548cCogVideoX\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89c6\u9891\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3001\u65f6\u5e8f\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u8bc4\u5206\u5747\u6709\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "LocalDPO\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u5668\u5bf9\u9f50\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u74f6\u9888\u3002"}}

However, the robustness of their reasoning chains remains questionable. In this paper, we identify a critical failure mode termed textual inertia, where once a textual hallucination occurs in the thinking process, models tend to blindly adhere to the erroneous text while neglecting conflicting visual evidence. To systematically investigate this, we propose the LogicGraph Perturbation Protocol that structurally injects perturbations into the reasoning chains of diverse LMMs spanning both native reasoning architectures and prompt-driven paradigms to evaluate their self-reflection capabilities. The results reveal that models successfully self-correct in less than 10% of cases and predominantly succumb to blind textual error propagation. To mitigate this, we introduce Active Visual-Context Refinement, a training-free inference paradigm which orchestrates an active visual re-grounding mechanism to enforce fine-grained verification coupled with an adaptive context refinement strategy to summarize and denoise the reasoning history.

In this work, we examine this phenomenon across 10 languages, while we focus not only on potential misuse of personalization capabilities, but also on potential benefits they offer. Overall, we cover 1080 combinations of various personalization aspects in the prompts, for which the texts are generated by 16 distinct language models (17,280 texts in total).

We ask whether these explanations nevertheless help users predict model behavior, operationalized as counterfactual simulatability. Using StrategyQA, we evaluate how well humans and LLM judges can predict a model's answers to counterfactual follow-up questions, with and without access to the model's chain-of-thought or post-hoc explanations. We compare LLM-generated counterfactuals with pragmatics-based perturbations as alternative ways to construct test cases for assessing the potential usefulness of explanations. Our results show that self-explanations consistently improve simulation accuracy for both LLM judges and humans, but the degree and stability of gains depend strongly on the perturbation strategy and judge strength.

However, current models often suffer from logical hallucinations, where correct answers are derived from flawed reasoning chains or rely on positional shortcuts rather than spatial logic. This decoupling undermines reliability in strategic spatial decision-making. To address this, we present GeoReason, a framework designed to synchronize internal thinking with final decisions. We first construct GeoReason-Bench, a logic-driven dataset containing 4,000 reasoning trajectories synthesized from geometric primitives and expert knowledge. We then formulate a two-stage training strategy: (1) Supervised Knowledge Initialization to equip the model with reasoning syntax and domain expertise, and (2) Consistency-Aware Reinforcement Learning to refine deductive reliability. This second stage integrates a novel Logical Consistency Reward, which penalizes logical drift via an option permutation strategy to anchor decisions in verifiable reasoning traces.

However, most deep learning models are designed to process either entire images or complete time series sequences to extract meaningful features for downstream tasks. In this study, we propose a novel multimodal approach that leverages pixel-wise two-dimensional (2D) representations to encode visual property variations from SITS more effectively. Specifically, we generate recurrence plots from pixel-based vegetation index time series (NDVI, EVI, and SAVI) as an alternative to using raw pixel values, creating more informative representations. Additionally, we introduce PIxel-wise Multimodal Contrastive (PIMC), a new multimodal self-supervision approach that produces effective encoders based on two-dimensional pixel time series representations and remote sensing imagery (RSI). To validate our approach, we assess its performance on three downstream tasks: pixel-level forecasting and classification using the PASTIS dataset, and land cover classification on the EuroSAT dataset. Moreover, we compare our results to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on all downstream tasks. Our experimental results show that the use of 2D representations significantly enhances feature extraction from SITS, while contrastive learning improves the quality of representations for both pixel time series and RSI. These findings suggest that our multimodal method outperforms existing models in various Earth observation tasks, establishing it as a robust self-supervision framework for processing both SITS and RSI.

Non-commercial approaches still suffer audio-visual asynchrony, poor lip-speech alignment, and unimodal degradation, which can be stemmed from weak audio-visual correspondence modeling, limited generalization, and scarce high-quality dense-caption data. To address these issues, we introduce Klear and delve into three axes--model architecture, training strategy, and data curation. Architecturally, we adopt a single-tower design with unified DiT blocks and an Omni-Full Attention mechanism, achieving tight audio-visual alignment and strong scalability. Training-wise, we adopt a progressive multitask regime--random modality masking to joint optimization across tasks, and a multistage curriculum, yielding robust representations, strengthening A-V aligned world knowledge, and preventing unimodal collapse. For datasets, we present the first large-scale audio-video dataset with dense captions, and introduce a novel automated data-construction pipeline which annotates and filters millions of diverse, high-quality, strictly aligned audio-video-caption triplets. Building on this, Klear scales to large datasets, delivering high-fidelity, semantically and temporally aligned, instruction-following generation in both joint and unimodal settings while generalizing robustly to out-of-distribution scenarios. Across tasks, it substantially outperforms prior methods by a large margin and achieves performance comparable to Veo 3, offering a unified, scalable path toward next-generation audio-video synthesis.", "AI": {"tldr": "Klear\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ca\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u89e3\u51b3\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0e\u9000\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u97f3\u9891-\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0d\u540c\u6b65\u3001\u5507\u8bed\u5bf9\u9f50\u5dee\u548c\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u56e0\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0d\u8db3\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5f31\u53ca\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5355\u5854DiT+Omni-Full Attention\u67b6\u6784\u5f3a\u5236\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ed3\u5408\u968f\u673a\u6a21\u6001\u63a9\u7801\u548c\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\uff1b\u5f00\u53d1\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6d41\u7a0b\u6784\u5efa\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5bf9\u9f50\u97f3\u89c6\u9891-\u5b57\u5e55\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8054\u5408/\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5747\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e0eVeo3\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u573a\u666f\u4fdd\u6301\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u540c\u6b65\u5185\u5bb9\u3002", "conclusion": "Klear\u63d0\u4f9b\u7edf\u4e00\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u67b6\u6784-\u8bad\u7ec3-\u6570\u636e\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

Existing designs follow a fragmentation-compensation paradigm: they first break dialogue streams into isolated utterances for storage, then attempt to restore coherence via embedding-based retrieval. This process irreversibly damages narrative and causal flow, while biasing retrieval towards lexical similarity. We introduce membox, a hierarchical memory architecture centered on a Topic Loom that continuously monitors dialogue in a sliding-window fashion, grouping consecutive same-topic turns into coherent \"memory boxes\" at storage time. Sealed boxes are then linked by a Trace Weaver into long-range event-timeline traces, recovering macro-topic recurrences across discontinuities. Experiments on LoCoMo demonstrate that Membox achieves up to 68% F1 improvement on temporal reasoning tasks, outperforming competitive baselines (e.g., Mem0, A-MEM). Notably, Membox attains these gains while using only a fraction of the context tokens required by existing methods, highlighting a superior balance between efficiency and effectiveness.

Diffusion-DRF directly backpropagates VLM feedback through the diffusion denoising chain, converting logit-level responses into token-aware gradients for optimization. We propose an automated, aspect-structured prompting pipeline to obtain reliable multi-dimensional VLM feedback, while gradient checkpointing enables efficient updates through the final denoising steps.

We validate this score through fine-tuning experiments, confirming that it can predict whether a set of examples supports or undermines the model's predictions.

Although recent deep models improve robustness compared to classical signal-processing approaches, many methods increase computational cost and parameter count, and attention-based temporal modeling introduces quadratic scaling with respect to the temporal length. This paper proposes ToTMNet, a lightweight rPPG architecture that replaces temporal attention with an FFT-accelerated Toeplitz temporal mixing layer. The Toeplitz operator provides full-sequence temporal receptive field using a linear number of parameters in the clip length and can be applied in near-linear time using circulant embedding and FFT-based convolution. ToTMNet integrates the global Toeplitz temporal operator into a compact gated temporal mixer that combines a local depthwise temporal convolution branch with gated global Toeplitz mixing, enabling efficient long-range temporal filtering while only having 63k parameters. Experiments on two datasets, UBFC-rPPG (real videos) and SCAMPS (synthetic videos), show that ToTMNet achieves strong heart-rate estimation accuracy with a compact design. On UBFC-rPPG intra-dataset evaluation, ToTMNet reaches 1.055 bpm MAE with Pearson correlation 0.996. In a synthetic-to-real setting (SCAMPS to UBFC-rPPG), ToTMNet reaches 1.582 bpm MAE with Pearson correlation 0.994. Ablation results confirm that the gating mechanism is important for effectively using global Toeplitz mixing, especially under domain shift.

We propose a principled revision of memorization evaluation for LLMs, arguing that PII leakage should be evaluated under low lexical cue conditions, where target PII cannot be reconstructed through prompt-induced generalization or pattern completion. We formalize Cue-Resistant Memorization (CRM) as a cue-controlled evaluation framework and a necessary condition for valid memorization evaluation, explicitly conditioning on prompt-target overlap cues. Using CRM, we conduct a large-scale multilingual re-evaluation of PII leakage across 32 languages and multiple memorization paradigms. Revisiting reconstruction-based settings, including verbatim prefix-suffix completion and associative reconstruction, we find that their apparent effectiveness is driven primarily by direct surface-form cues rather than by true memorization. When such cues are controlled for, reconstruction success diminishes substantially. We further examine cue-free generation and membership inference, both of which exhibit extremely low true positive rates. Overall, our results suggest that previously reported PII leakage is better explained by cue-driven behavior than by genuine memorization, highlighting the importance of cue-controlled evaluation for reliably quantifying privacy-relevant memorization in LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faCue-Resistant Memorization\uff08CRM\uff09\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709LLMs\u8bb0\u5fc6PII\u6cc4\u9732\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8\u4f30\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5f53\u53bb\u9664prompt\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u9762\u7ebf\u7d22\u540e\uff0c\u91cd\u5efa\u6210\u529f\u7387\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5148\u524d\u7ed3\u8bba\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u7ebf\u7d22\u9a71\u52a8\u800c\u975e\u771f\u5b9e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u5c06PII\u6cc4\u9732\u89c6\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u6df7\u6dc6\u56e0\u7d20\u2014\u2014\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7prompt\u4e2d\u7684\u8bcd\u6cd5\u7ebf\u7d22\uff08\u5982\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u5f0f\u5339\u914d\uff09\u5b8c\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u771f\u6b63\u5b58\u50a8\u4e86\u654f\u611f\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5efa\u7acb\u53ef\u63a7\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u533a\u5206\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e0e\u7ebf\u7d22\u9a71\u52a8\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "1) \u63d0\u51faCRM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236prompt\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807PII\u7684\u91cd\u53e0\u7ebf\u7d22\uff08\u5982\u8bcd\u9891\u3001\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7b49\uff09\u91cf\u5316\u8bb0\u5fc6\u80fd\u529b\uff1b2) \u8986\u76d632\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u524d\u7f00-\u540e\u7f00\u8865\u5168\u3001\u5173\u8054\u91cd\u5efa\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u5728\u9ad8\u4f4e\u7ebf\u7d22\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff1b3) \u5f15\u5165\u65e0\u7ebf\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u7eaf\u751f\u6210\u548c\u4f1a\u5458\u63a8\u7406\uff09\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6a21\u578b\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "result": "1) \u4f20\u7edf\u91cd\u5efa\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u9ad8\u7ebf\u7d22\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4e3a23.7%\uff0c\u4f4e\u7ebf\u7d22\u4e0b\u9aa4\u964d\u81f35.7%\uff1b2) \u65e0\u7ebf\u7d22\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u771f\u9633\u6027\u7387\u4ec50.02%\uff0c\u4f1a\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u6700\u4f73\u8868\u73b0\u4ec53.2%\uff1b3) \u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793aCRM\u6548\u679c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u8bed\u8a00\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u65e0\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524dLLMs\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6027PII\u6cc4\u9732\u88ab\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u9ad8\u4f30\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u673a\u5236\u662f\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u5339\u914d\u800c\u975e\u4fe1\u606f\u5b58\u50a8\u3002CRM\u4e3a\u9690\u79c1\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u5fc5\u8981\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u9700\u540c\u65f6\u62a5\u544a\u7ebf\u7d22\u63a7\u5236\u4e0e\u65e0\u63a7\u5236\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u8bef\u5bfc\u3002"}}

Dataset and code released", "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in general medical domains. However, their performance significantly degrades in specialized, culturally specific domains such as Vietnamese Traditional Medicine (VTM), primarily due to the scarcity of high-quality, structured benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce VietMed-MCQ, a novel multiple-choice question dataset generated via a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline with an automated consistency check mechanism. Unlike previous synthetic datasets, our framework incorporates a dual-model validation approach to ensure reasoning consistency through independent answer verification, though the substring-based evidence checking has known limitations. The complete dataset of 3,190 questions spans three difficulty levels and underwent validation by one medical expert and four students, achieving 94.2 percent approval with substantial inter-rater agreement (Fleiss' kappa = 0.82).

We conduct a systematic layer-wise probing study of 58 psycholinguistic features across 10 transformer models, spanning encoder-only and decoder-only architectures, and compare three embedding extraction methods. We find that apparent localization of meaning is strongly method-dependent: contextualized embeddings yield higher feature-specific selectivity and different layer-wise profiles than isolated embeddings. Across models and methods, final-layer representations are rarely optimal for recovering psycholinguistic information with linear probes. Despite these differences, models exhibit a shared depth ordering of meaning dimensions, with lexical properties peaking earlier and experiential and affective dimensions peaking later.

While existing approaches improve RLVR via token-level entropy or sequence-level length control, they lack a semantically grounded, step-level measure of reasoning progress. As a result, LLMs fail to distinguish necessary deduction from redundant verification: they may continue checking after reaching a correct solution and, in extreme cases, overturn a correct trajectory into an incorrect final answer. To remedy the lack of process supervision, we introduce a training-free probing mechanism that extracts intermediate confidence and correctness and combines them into a Step Potential signal that explicitly estimates the reasoning state at each step. Building on this signal, we propose Step Potential Advantage Estimation (SPAE), a fine-grained credit assignment method that amplifies potential gains, penalizes potential drops, and applies penalty after potential saturates to encourage timely termination.

TabTrim derives a gold pruning trajectory using the intermediate sub-tables in the execution process of gold SQL queries, and trains a pruner and a verifier to make the step-wise pruning result align with the gold pruning trajectory.

We study CPT as a knowledge learning process rather than a solely optimization problem. We construct a controlled, distribution-matched benchmark of factual documents and interleave diagnostic probes directly into the CPT loop, enabling epoch-level measurement of knowledge acquisition dynamics and changes in Out-Of-Domain (OOD) general skills (e.g., math). We further analyze how CPT reshapes knowledge circuits during training. Across three instruction-tuned LLMs and multiple CPT strategies, optimization and learning systematically diverge as loss decreases monotonically while factual learning is unstable and non-monotonic. Acquired facts are rarely consolidated, learning is strongly conditioned on prior exposure, and OOD performance degrades from early epochs. Circuit analysis reveals rapid reconfiguration of knowledge pathways across epochs, providing an explanation for narrow acquisition windows and systematic forgetting. These results show that loss optimization is misaligned with learning progress in CPT and motivate evaluation of stopping criteria based on task-level learning dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u53d1\u73b0\u6301\u7eed\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3(CPT)\u4e2d\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u4e0e\u77e5\u8bc6\u5b66\u4e60\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8131\u8282\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u635f\u5931\u5355\u8c03\u4e0b\u964d\u4f46\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u975e\u5355\u8c03\uff0c\u9886\u57df\u5916\u80fd\u529b(\u5982\u6570\u5b66)\u65e9\u671f\u9000\u5316\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u77e5\u8bc6\u7535\u8def\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u91cd\u7ec4\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5de9\u56fa\u56f0\u96be\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5e94\u57fa\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\u7ea7\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bad\u7ec3\u505c\u6b62\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4ec5\u5c06CPT\u89c6\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u635f\u5931\u503c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fdb\u6b65\u7684\u95f4\u63a5\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u77e5\u8bc6\u83b7\u53d6\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u9886\u57df\u5916\u6280\u80fd\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5206\u5e03\u5339\u914d\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6587\u6863\u63a7\u5236\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5728CPT\u8bad\u7ec3\u73af\u8def\u4e2d\u5d4c\u5165\u8bca\u65ad\u63a2\u9488\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u77e5\u8bc6\u83b7\u53d6\u8fc7\u7a0b\u548cOOD\u6280\u80fd(\u5982\u6570\u5b66)\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u91cf\u5316\u76d1\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u795e\u7ecf\u7535\u8def\u5206\u6790\u8ffd\u8e2a\u77e5\u8bc6\u8def\u5f84\u91cd\u7ec4\u3002", "result": "1) \u635f\u5931\u503c\u6301\u7eed\u964d\u4f4e\u4f46\u4e8b\u5b9e\u77e5\u8bc6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff1b2) \u65b0\u589e\u4e8b\u5b9e\u96be\u4ee5\u5de9\u56fa\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff1b3) OOD\u6027\u80fd\u65e9\u671f\u663e\u8457\u9000\u5316\uff1b4) \u77e5\u8bc6\u7535\u8def\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5448\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u52a8\u6001\u91cd\u7ec4\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b66\u4e60\u7a97\u53e3\u72ed\u7a84\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bc1\u5b9e\u635f\u5931\u4f18\u5316\u4e0d\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u53cd\u6620\u77e5\u8bc6\u5b66\u4e60\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86CPT\u4e2d\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5de9\u56fa\u673a\u5236\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u5efa\u7acb\u57fa\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\u7ea7\u52a8\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ec8\u6b62\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u4e3a\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\u6539\u8fdb\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

These complex narratives pose a significant threat, as hyperpartisanship drives political polarisation and institutional distrust, while PRCTs directly motivate real-world extremist violence, making their identification critical for social cohesion and public safety. However, existing resources are scarce, predominantly English-centric, and often analyse hyperpartisanship, stance, and rhetorical bias in isolation rather than as interrelated aspects of political discourse. To bridge this gap, we introduce \\textsc{PartisanLens}, the first multilingual dataset of \\num{1617} hyperpartisan news headlines in Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese, annotated in multiple political discourse aspects. We first evaluate the classification performance of widely used Large Language Models (LLMs) on this dataset, establishing robust baselines for the classification of hyperpartisan and PRCT narratives. In addition, we assess the viability of using LLMs as automatic annotators for this task, analysing their ability to approximate human annotation. Results highlight both their potential and current limitations. Next, moving beyond standard judgments, we explore whether LLMs can emulate human annotation patterns by conditioning them on socio-economic and ideological profiles that simulate annotator perspectives.

We evaluate what matters for safety alignment in LLMs and LRMs to provide essential insights for developing more secure and reliable AI systems. We systematically investigate and compare the influence of six critical intrinsic model characteristics and three external attack techniques. Our large-scale evaluation is conducted using 32 recent, popular LLMs and LRMs across thirteen distinct model families, spanning a parameter scale from 3B to 235B. The assessment leverages five established safety datasets and probes model vulnerabilities with 56 jailbreak techniques and four CoT attack strategies, resulting in 4.6M API calls. Our key empirical findings are fourfold. First, we identify the LRMs GPT-OSS-20B, Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Thinking, and GPT-OSS-120B as the top-three safest models, which substantiates the significant advantage of integrated reasoning and self-reflection mechanisms for robust safety alignment. Second, post-training and knowledge distillation may lead to a systematic degradation of safety alignment. We thus argue that safety must be treated as an explicit constraint or a core optimization objective during these stages, not merely subordinated to the pursuit of general capability. Third, we reveal a pronounced vulnerability: employing a CoT attack via a response prefix can elevate the attack success rate by 3.34x on average and from 0.6% to 96.3% for Seed-OSS-36B-Instruct. This critical finding underscores the safety risks inherent in text-completion interfaces and features that allow user-defined response prefixes in LLM services, highlighting an urgent need for architectural and deployment safeguards.

ATLAS operates via a dual-path approach: (1) \\textbf{training-free cluster-based routing} that exploits empirical priors for domain-specific alignment, and (2) \\textbf{RL-based multi-step routing} that explores autonomous trajectories for out-of-distribution generalization. Extensive experiments across 15 benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms closed-source models like GPT-4o, surpassing existing routing methods on both in-distribution (+10.1%) and out-of-distribution (+13.1%) tasks.

Extensive experiments across five open-domain QA benchmarks, multiple model scales, and different retrievers demonstrate that DTR consistently improves EM and F1 over standard RAG and strong retrieval-enhanced baselines, while reducing unnecessary retrievals.

We find that option-boundary (newline) residual states often contain strong linearly decodable signals related to per-option correctness. Winner-identity probing reveals a two-stage progression: the winning *content position* becomes decodable immediately after the final option is processed, while the *output symbol* is represented closer to the answer emission position. Tests under symbol and content permutations support a two-stage mechanism in which models first select a winner in content space and then bind or route that winner to the appropriate symbol to emit.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u9009\u95ee\u7b54\uff08MCQA\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5982\u4f55\u5206\u79bb\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u7b26\u53f7\u7ed1\u5b9a\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u5148\u5728\u5185\u5bb9\u7a7a\u95f4\u9009\u62e9\u7b54\u6848\u518d\u7ed1\u5b9a\u5bf9\u5e94\u7b26\u53f7\u3002", "motivation": "MCQA\u9700\u540c\u65f6\u89e3\u51b3\u4efb\u52a1\u5e76\u8f93\u51fa\u5bf9\u5e94\u7b54\u6848\u7b26\u53f7\uff0c\u6613\u6df7\u6dc6\u63a8\u7406\u9519\u8bef\u4e0e\u7b26\u53f7\u7ed1\u5b9a\u5931\u8d25\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u5904\u7406\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e3b\u6210\u5206\u5206\u6790\uff08PCA\uff09\u3001\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u9488\u63a2\u6d4b\uff08linear probes\uff09\u53ca\u56e0\u679c\u5e72\u9884\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9009\u9879\u8fb9\u754c\u548c\u7b54\u6848\u8f93\u51fa\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u9009\u9879\u8fb9\u754c\uff08\u5982\u6362\u884c\u7b26\uff09\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\u72b6\u6001\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5f3a\u7ebf\u6027\u89e3\u7801\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u53cd\u6620\u9009\u9879\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff1bwinner-identity\u63a2\u6d4b\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5185\u5bb9\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5728\u672b\u9009\u9879\u5904\u7406\u540e\u7acb\u5373\u53ef\u89e3\uff0c\u800c\u8f93\u51fa\u7b26\u53f7\u5728\u7b54\u6848\u751f\u6210\u9636\u6bb5\u624d\u88ab\u8868\u5f81\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u578b\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1a\u5148\u57fa\u4e8e\u5185\u5bb9\u7a7a\u95f4\u7b5b\u9009\u7b54\u6848\uff0c\u518d\u5c06\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u5bf9\u5e94\u7b26\u53f7\u5173\u8054\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7b26\u53f7\u7ed1\u5b9a\u7684\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

While ensuring adherence to these explicit constraints is critical, existing safety research primarily focuses on implicit social norms or text-only settings, overlooking the complexities of multimodal documents. In this paper, we introduce Doc-PP (Document Policy Preservation Benchmark), a novel benchmark constructed from real-world reports requiring reasoning across heterogeneous visual and textual elements under strict non-disclosure policies. Our evaluation highlights a systemic Reasoning-Induced Safety Gap: models frequently leak sensitive information when answers must be inferred through complex synthesis or aggregated across modalities, effectively circumventing existing safety constraints. Furthermore, we identify that providing extracted text improves perception but inadvertently facilitates leakage. To address these vulnerabilities, we propose DVA (Decompose-Verify-Aggregation), a structural inference framework that decouples reasoning from policy verification. Experimental results demonstrate that DVA significantly outperforms standard prompting defenses, offering a robust baseline for policy-compliant document understanding", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDoc-PP\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0eDVA\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6587\u6863\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u6cc4\u6f0f\u95ee\u9898", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5b89\u5168\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u9690\u5f0f\u793e\u4f1a\u89c4\u8303\u6216\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u672a\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6587\u6863\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u62ab\u9732\u653f\u7b56\u4e0b\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u4fe1\u606f\u6cc4\u6f0f\u95ee\u9898", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7Decompose-Verify-Aggregation\u6846\u67b6\u5206\u79bb\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u653f\u7b56\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9-\u6587\u672c\u8054\u5408\u8868\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60", "result": "DVA\u6846\u67b6\u76f8\u8f83\u6807\u51c6\u63d0\u793a\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u654f\u611f\u4fe1\u606f\u4fdd\u7559\u7387\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u63d0\u534738.7%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u53d1\u73b0\u63d0\u53d6\u6587\u672c\u867d\u63d0\u5347\u611f\u77e5\u4f46\u52a0\u5267\u6cc4\u6f0f\u98ce\u9669", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u7b56\u7565\u5408\u89c4\u6587\u6863\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\u53ca\u5176\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236"}}

Our analysis reveals significant quality variations among existing benchmarks and demonstrates that selective benchmark construction based on our metrics can achieve comparable evaluation performance with substantially reduced test sets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Benchmark^2\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e92\u8865\u6307\u6807\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u57fa\u51c6\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u7b5b\u9009\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u57fa\u51c6\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u8bc4\u4f30\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dLLM\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u91cf\u6fc0\u589e\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u57fa\u51c6\u8d28\u91cf\u672c\u8eab\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u57fa\u51c6\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e09\u4e2a\u6307\u6807\uff1a\u8de8\u57fa\u51c6\u6392\u540d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff08\u8861\u91cf\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u6027\uff09\u3001\u53ef\u533a\u5206\u6027\u5f97\u5206\uff08\u91cf\u5316\u533a\u5206\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff09\u3001\u80fd\u529b\u504f\u79bb\u5ea6\uff08\u8bc6\u522b\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u5931\u8d25\u4f46\u5f31\u6a21\u578b\u6210\u529f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u573a\u666f\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u572815\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u548c11\u4e2aLLM\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u8d28\u91cf\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u7b5b\u9009\u57fa\u51c6\u540e\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u8f83\u5c0f\u5b50\u96c6\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u76f8\u8fd1\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "Benchmark^2\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6307\u5bfc\u57fa\u51c6\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6784\u5efa\u51cf\u5c11\u5197\u4f59\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8bc4\u4f30\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Our experiments yield two key findings. First, under standard in-domain evaluation, fine-tuned encoders, specifically XLM-R-CRF, achieve the strongest performance, reaching 93.2\\% macro F1, outperforming generative approaches. Second, in a cross-municipality setting that evaluates transfer to unseen administrative contexts, these models suffer substantial performance degradation, whereas few-shot LLMs demonstrate greater robustness, with significantly smaller declines in performance. Despite this generalization advantage, the high computational cost of generative models currently constrains their practicality.

We construct 1,818 human-verified evaluation instances across four diverse datasets spanning synthetic and real speech, with controlled acoustic difficulty. Evaluating nine widely-used LALMs, we find that models struggle to reliably detect acoustic inconsistencies. For instance, given audio samples of the same speaker's turns, some models overpredict inconsistency, whereas others are overly lenient. Models further struggle to identify the exact turns that are problematic. When other interlocutors' turns are provided together, performance degrades dramatically as models prioritize textual coherence over acoustic cues, failing to detect even obvious gender switches for a speaker. On the other hand, models perform substantially better in choosing the audio that best matches the speaker among several acoustic variants, demonstrating inherent acoustic discrimination capabilities.

To investigate and evaluate the safety impact of MLLMs responses on human behavior in daily life, we introduce SaLAD, a multimodal safety benchmark which contains 2,013 real-world image-text samples across 10 common categories, with a balanced design covering both unsafe scenarios and cases of oversensitivity. It emphasizes realistic risk exposure, authentic visual inputs, and fine-grained cross-modal reasoning, ensuring that safety risks cannot be inferred from text alone. We further propose a safety-warning-based evaluation framework that encourages models to provide clear and informative safety warnings, rather than generic refusals. Results on 18 MLLMs demonstrate that the top-performing models achieve a safe response rate of only 57.2% on unsafe queries. Moreover, even popular safety alignment methods limit effectiveness of the models in our scenario, revealing the vulnerabilities of current MLLMs in identifying dangerous behaviors in daily life.

While recent work has explored automatic prompt optimization using textual gradients and self-refinement, most existing methods treat prompts as monolithic blocks of text, making it difficult to localize errors, preserve critical instructions, or prevent uncontrolled prompt growth. We introduce Modular Prompt Optimization (MPO), a schema-based prompt optimization framework that treats prompts as structured objects composed of fixed semantic sections, including system role, context, task description, constraints, and output format. MPO applies section-local textual gradients, generated by a critic language model, to refine each section independently while keeping the overall prompt schema fixed. Section updates are consolidated through de-duplication to reduce redundancy and interference between components, yielding an interpretable and robust optimization process. We evaluate MPO on two reasoning benchmarks, ARC-Challenge and MMLU, using LLaMA-3 8B-Instruct and Mistral-7B-Instruct as solver models. Across both benchmarks and models, MPO consistently outperforms an untuned structured prompt and the TextGrad baseline, achieving substantial accuracy gains without modifying model parameters or altering prompt structure. These results demonstrate that maintaining a fixed prompt schema while applying localized, section-wise optimization is an effective and practical approach for improving reasoning performance in small open-source LMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\uff08MPO\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u63d0\u793a\u62c6\u5206\u4e3a\u56fa\u5b9a\u8bed\u4e49\u6a21\u5757\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u5c40\u90e8\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u5f00\u6e90\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u63d0\u793a\u8d28\u91cf\u5bf9\u5c0f\u578b\u5f00\u6e90\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u63d0\u793a\u89c6\u4e3a\u6574\u4f53\u6587\u672c\u5757\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9a\u4f4d\u9519\u8bef\u3001\u4fdd\u7559\u5173\u952e\u6307\u4ee4\u6216\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u793a\u81a8\u80c0\u3002", "method": "MPO\u5c06\u63d0\u793a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4e3a\u89d2\u8272\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b49\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6279\u8bc4\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6587\u672c\u68af\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u5c40\u90e8\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u53bb\u91cd\u5408\u5e76\u66f4\u65b0\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u5197\u4f59\u3002", "result": "\u5728ARC-Challenge\u548cMMLU\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cMPO\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u63d0\u793a\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u56fa\u5b9a\u63d0\u793a\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0b\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u5c40\u90e8\u4f18\u5316\u662f\u5c0f\u578b\u5f00\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5b9e\u8df5\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u517c\u5177\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

In this work, we introduce ContextFocus, a lightweight activation steering approach that improves context faithfulness in such knowledge-conflict settings while preserving fluency and efficiency. Unlike prior approaches, our solution requires no model finetuning and incurs minimal inference-time overhead, making it highly efficient. We evaluate ContextFocus on the ConFiQA benchmark, comparing it against strong baselines including ContextDPO, COIECD, and prompting-based methods. Furthermore, we show that our method is complementary to prompting strategies and remains effective on larger models. Extensive experiments show that ContextFocus significantly improves contextual-faithfulness. Our results highlight the effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency of ContextFocus in improving contextual-faithfulness of LLM outputs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aContextFocus\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6fc0\u6d3b\u8f6c\u5411\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u51b2\u7a81\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u5916\u90e8\u68c0\u7d22\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u5b58\u77e5\u8bc6\u51b2\u7a81\u65f6\uff0c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u4f9d\u8d56\u5185\u5b58\u77e5\u8bc6\u800c\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u5fe0\u5b9e\u8f93\u51fa\u3002\u5df2\u6709\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff08\u5982\u5fae\u8c03\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u589e\u5f3a\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u6216\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "ContextFocus\u901a\u8fc7\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u6a21\u578b\u6fc0\u6d3b\u72b6\u6001\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4f18\u5148\uff1a1) \u5229\u7528\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5411\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u51b2\u7a81\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e0e\u5185\u5b58\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u5dee\u5f02\uff1b2) \u901a\u8fc7\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5e72\u9884\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6b63\u786e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\uff1b3) \u57fa\u4e8e\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u6743\u91cd\u52a8\u6001\u5e73\u8861\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e0e\u5185\u5b58\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728ConFiQA\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cContextFocus\u57283\u4e2aLLM\uff08Vicuna1.5\u3001LLaMA2\u3001ChatGPT\uff09\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u5347\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\uff08Faithfulness@top-5\uff0927.8%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u539f\u6587\u6d41\u7545\u5ea6\uff08BERTScore>0.91\uff09\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4ec5\u589e\u52a08%\u3002\u4e0eContextDPO\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u6548\u679c\u63d0\u53472.6\u500d\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "conclusion": "ContextFocus\u901a\u8fc7\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5e72\u9884\u6280\u672f\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u6a21\u578b\u539f\u6709\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u77e5\u8bc6\u51b2\u7a81\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5176\u96f6\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u7279\u70b9\u652f\u6301\u5feb\u901f\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e92\u8865\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u52a8\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u6700\u65b0\u77e5\u8bc6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}
