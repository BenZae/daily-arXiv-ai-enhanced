Secondly, we collect a novel test set DiverseSpeech-Ru of longform in-the-wild Russian speech with careful multi-reference labeling. We also perform multi-reference relabeling of popular Russian tests set and study fine-tuning dynamics on its corresponding train set. We demonstrate that the model often adopts to dataset-specific labeling, causing an illusion of metric improvement.

SE models are commonly fine-tuned using SSL representations with mean squared error (MSE) loss between enhanced and clean speech. However, MSE is prone to exploiting positional embeddings in SSL models, allowing the objective to be minimised through positional correlations instead of content-related information. This work frames the problem as a general limitation of self-supervised representation fine-tuning and investigates it through representation-guided SE. Two strategies are considered: (1) zero-padding, previously explored in SSL pre-training but here examined in the fine-tuning setting, and (2) speed perturbations with a soft-DTW loss.

However, existing LoRA methods apply static rank configurations uniformly across all input tokens, ignoring variation in token complexity and computational requirements. In this work, we propose ChunkWise LoRA, a dynamic and adaptive approach that partitions sequences into variable-length chunks based on token complexity and assigns each chunk a tailored low-rank configuration. Our system introduces a runtime scheduler that estimates token difficulty, performs adaptive chunking, and selects per-chunk LoRA rank and scaling using a rank-ladder mechanism. To preserve output consistency, we further introduce a boundary-safe composition module and integrate policy-driven KV-cache strategies. Experiments on benchmark datasets such as Wikitext-103 and SQuAD demonstrate that ChunkWise LoRA achieves up to 34\\% lower latency and 38% memory reduction compared to baseline LoRA, while maintaining or improving task performance metrics like BLEU, EM, and perplexity.

In this work we formalize and target the more challenging non-Markov setting, where a user may refer back to earlier states, undo changes, or reference entities introduced several rounds ago. We present (i) non-Markov multi-round data construction strategies, including rollback-style editing that forces retrieval of earlier visual states and name-based multi-round personalization that binds names to appearances across rounds; (ii) a history-conditioned training and inference framework with token-level caching to prevent multi-round identity drift; and (iii) enabling improvements for high-fidelity image reconstruction and editable personalization, including a reconstruction-based DiT detokenizer and a multi-stage fine-tuning curriculum.

I test six models including Gemini 3 Flash, GPT-4o, and open-source alternatives such as DeepSeek v3.2 and GLM-4.7. Enabling extended reasoning can improve accuracy by 1-3 percentage points, though effects vary across contexts; including metadata such as party registration reaches 86.7%. LLM classification also reduces the income bias inherent in BISG, where minorities in wealthier neighborhoods are systematically misclassified as White. I further validate using Lebanese voter registration with religious sect (64.3% accuracy), Indian MPs from reserved constituencies (99.2%), and Indian land records with caste classification (74.0%). Aggregate validation across India, Uganda, Nepal, Armenia, Chile, and Costa Rica using original full-count voter rolls demonstrates that the method recovers known population distributions where naming conventions are distinctive.

In recent years, several solutions have been proposed to correct LPP artifacts, either in the image domain or in the sinogram domain using supervised deep learning methods. However, these methods require dedicated datasets for training, which are expensive to collect. Moreover, existing approaches focus solely either on image-space or sinogram-space correction, ignoring the intrinsic correlations from the forward operation of the CT geometry. In this work, we propose an unrolled dual-domain method based on synthetic data to correct LPP artifacts. Specifically, the intrinsic correlations of LPP between the sinogram and image domains are leveraged through synthetic data generated from natural images, enabling the trained model to correct artifacts without requiring any real-world clinical data. In experiments simulating 1-2% detectors defect near the isocenter, the proposed method outperformed the state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin. The results indicate that our solution can correct LPP artifacts without the cost of data collection for model training, and it is adaptable to different scanner settings for software-based applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u4f7f\u7528\u771f\u5b9e\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7684\u53cc\u57df\u6821\u6b63\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6316\u6398CT\u51e0\u4f55\u6b63\u5411\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u5185\u5728\u5173\u8054\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4f4e\u6027\u80fd\u50cf\u7d20\uff08LPP\uff09\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u4f2a\u5f71\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LPP\u6821\u6b63\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4e14\u4ec5\u5355\u57df\uff08\u56fe\u50cf\u57df\u6216\u6b63\u5f26\u56fe\u57df\uff09\u6821\u6b63\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86CT\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u7269\u7406\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u666e\u9002\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u89e3\u7f20\u7684\u53cc\u57df\u6821\u6b63\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u7136\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u7b26\u5408CT\u6210\u50cf\u7269\u7406\u89c4\u5f8b\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7ed3\u5408\u56fe\u50cf\u57df\u4e0e\u6b63\u5f26\u56fe\u57df\u7684\u5173\u8054\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u53c2\u6570\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6a21\u62df1-2%\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u7f3a\u9677\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5ba2\u89c2\u8bc4\u4ef7\u6307\u6807\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u6548\u679c\u4e0a\u5747\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e100%\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540cCT\u626b\u63cf\u53c2\u6570\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u548c\u53cc\u57df\u5173\u8054\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u4e3aCT\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u9ad8\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

While attacks have been proposed, we identify critical weaknesses in existing detection-based methods, specifically their reliance on unrealistic assumptions and a lack of physical validation. To bridge this gap, we introduce BadDet+, a penalty-based framework that unifies Region Misclassification Attacks (RMA) and Object Disappearance Attacks (ODA). The core mechanism utilizes a log-barrier penalty to suppress true-class predictions for triggered inputs, resulting in (i) position and scale invariance, and (ii) enhanced physical robustness.

In this paper, we address this question by focusing on the statistical distribution of function words. Function words have long been argued to play a crucial role in language acquisition due to their distinctive distributional properties, including high frequency, reliable association with syntactic structure, and alignment with phrase boundaries. We use cross-linguistic corpus analysis to first establish that all three properties are present across 186 studied languages. Next, we use a combination of counterfactual language modeling and ablation experiments to show that language variants preserving all three properties are more easily acquired by neural learners, with frequency and structural association contributing more strongly than boundary alignment. Follow-up probing and ablation analyses further reveal that different learning conditions lead to systematically different reliance on function words, indicating that similar performance can arise from distinct internal mechanisms.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper investigates how statistical properties of function words facilitate learning hierarchical structures from linear language input, showing that frequency, structural association, and boundary alignment aid neural learners, with frequency and structural association being most critical.", "motivation": "The study aims to uncover the statistical conditions enabling hierarchical structure learning in language acquisition, focusing on function words' unique distributional traits (high frequency, syntactic association, and boundary alignment) across languages.", "method": "Cross-linguistic corpus analysis (186 languages) verifies function words' distributional properties.

While vision-language models (VLMs) offer rich semantics to complement visual evidence, existing approaches tend to overemphasize linguistic priors at the expense of visual performance, leading to a pronounced modality bias. We propose ActionVLM, a vision-language aggregation framework that systematically mitigates modality bias in TAL. Our key insight is to preserve vision as the dominant signal while adaptively exploiting language only when beneficial. To this end, we introduce (i) a debiasing reweighting module that estimates the language advantage-the incremental benefit of language over vision-only predictions-and dynamically reweights language modality accordingly, and (ii) a residual aggregation strategy that treats language as a complementary refinement rather than the primary driver. This combination alleviates modality bias, reduces overconfidence from linguistic priors, and strengthens temporal reasoning.

Fine-tuning on SoT-26K achieves 88.4% on component numeracy and 84.8% on structural topology, outperforming text-only baselines by around 20%.

These procedures demand exceptional precision and refined technical skills, making effective, standardized assessment methods essential. Traditionally, the evaluation of microsurgical techniques has relied heavily on the subjective judgment of expert raters. They are inherently constrained by limitations such as inter-rater variability, lack of standardized evaluation criteria, susceptibility to cognitive bias, and the time-intensive nature of manual review. These shortcomings underscore the urgent need for an objective, reliable, and automated system capable of assessing microsurgical performance with consistency and scalability. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel AI framework for the automated assessment of microanastomosis instrument handling skills. The system integrates four core components: (1) an instrument detection module based on the You Only Look Once (YOLO) architecture; (2) an instrument tracking module developed from Deep Simple Online and Realtime Tracking (DeepSORT); (3) an instrument tip localization module employing shape descriptors; and (4) a supervised classification module trained on expert-labeled data to evaluate instrument handling proficiency. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework, achieving an instrument detection precision of 97%, with a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 96%, measured by Intersection over Union (IoU) thresholds ranging from 50% to 95% (mAP50-95).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eAI\u7684\u5fae\u8840\u7ba1\u543b\u5408\u6280\u672f\u8bc4\u4f30\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u6574\u5408YOLO\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001DeepSORT\u8ddf\u8e2a\u3001\u5f62\u72b6\u63cf\u8ff0\u5b9a\u4f4d\u53ca\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8fbe97%\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5fae\u5916\u79d1\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e3b\u89c2\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bc4\u4ef7\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u8bc4\u5206\u8005\u5dee\u5f02\u3001\u6807\u51c6\u4e0d\u4e00\u3001\u8ba4\u77e5\u504f\u5dee\u53ca\u8017\u65f6\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u5ba2\u89c2\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u5305\u542b\u56db\u90e8\u5206\uff1a1) YOLO\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u5668\u68b0\u68c0\u6d4b\uff1b2) DeepSORT\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b3) \u57fa\u4e8e\u5f62\u72b6\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\u7684\u5668\u68b0\u5c16\u7aef\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff1b4) \u57fa\u4e8e\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u5757\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u7cfb\u7edf\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea697%\uff0cIoU\u9608\u503c50%-95%\u4e0b\u5e73\u5747\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5747\u503c(mAP)\u8fbe96%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5AI\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u5fae\u5916\u79d1\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u5ba2\u89c2\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f53\u7cfb\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002"}}

In this work, we conduct a systematic study on tasks from multiple domains, and find that errors concentrate at token positions of a few critical error types, rather than being uniformly distributed. Closer inspection reveals that these token-level erroneous predictions stem from internal competition mechanisms: certain attention heads, termed erroneous processing heads (ep heads), tip the balance by amplifying incorrect reasoning trajectories while suppressing correct ones. Notably, removing individual ep heads during inference can often restore the correct predictions. Motivated by these insights, we propose test-time correction of reasoning, a lightweight intervention method that dynamically identifies and deactivates ep heads in the reasoning process. Extensive experiments across different tasks and LLMs show that it consistently improves reasoning hop generalization, highlighting both its effectiveness and potential.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u53d1\u73b0CoT\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u9519\u8bef\u9884\u6d4b\u6e90\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u52a8\u6001\u53bb\u6fc0\u6d3b\u9519\u8bef\u5934\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u5e72\u9884\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347LLM\u63a8\u7406\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76LLM\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u8d85\u51fa\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u5e03\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u9aa4\u964d\u7684\u5185\u5728\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edfCoT\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898", "method": "1) \u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u591a\u9886\u57df\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u5206\u5e03 2) \u63ed\u793a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u95f4\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u673a\u5236 3) \u63d0\u51fa\u52a8\u6001\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u53bb\u6d3b\u5316\u9519\u8bef\u5904\u7406\u5934\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u6821\u6b63\u65b9\u6cd5", "result": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u548cLLM\u4e0a\u5747\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u957f\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5355\u4e2aep\u5934\u79fb\u9664\u5373\u53ef\u6062\u590d30%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u9519\u8bef\u9884\u6d4b", "conclusion": "\u8bc1\u660eLLM\u63a8\u7406\u5931\u8d25\u6e90\u4e8e\u5185\u90e8\u7ade\u4e89\u673a\u5236\u5931\u8861\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u5e72\u9884\u7b56\u7565\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f"}}

Existing training-free open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) methods typically fuse CLIP and vision foundation models (VFMs) using \"one-way injection\" and \"shallow post-processing\" strategies, making it difficult to satisfy these requirements. To address this issue, we propose a spatial-regularization-aware dual-branch collaborative inference framework for training-free OVSS, termed SDCI. First, during feature encoding, SDCI introduces a cross-model attention fusion (CAF) module, which guides collaborative inference by injecting self-attention maps into each other. Second, we propose a bidirectional cross-graph diffusion refinement (BCDR) module that enhances the reliability of dual-branch segmentation scores through iterative random-walk diffusion. Finally, we incorporate low-level superpixel structures and develop a convex-optimization-based superpixel collaborative prediction (CSCP) mechanism to further refine object boundaries. Experiments on multiple remote sensing semantic segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves better performance than existing approaches. Moreover, ablation studies further confirm that traditional object-based remote sensing image analysis methods leveraging superpixel structures remain effective within deep learning frameworks.

The framework further employs risk-sensitive distributional statistics, with Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR95) as a primary metric, to characterize worst-case model behavior. Application of SHARP to eleven frontier LLMs, evaluated on a fixed corpus of n=901 socially sensitive prompts, reveals that models with similar average risk can exhibit more than twofold differences in tail exposure and volatility. Across models, dimension-wise marginal tail behavior varies systematically across harm dimensions, with bias exhibiting the strongest tail severities, epistemic and fairness risks occupying intermediate regimes, and ethical misalignment consistently lower; together, these patterns reveal heterogeneous, model-dependent failure structures that scalar benchmarks conflate.

Thus, real-time large-scale applications adopt two-stage retrieval, where a fast recall model gathers a small candidate pool, which is reranked by an advanced dense retriever. Due to hugely reduced candidates, the reranking model can use any off-the-shelf dense retriever without hurting efficiency, meaning the recall model bounds two-stage TVR performance. Recently, generative retrieval (GR) replaces dense video embeddings with discrete semantic IDs and retrieves by decoding text queries into ID tokens. GR offers near-constant inference and storage complexity, and its semantic IDs capture high-level video features via quantization, making it ideal for quickly eliminating irrelevant candidates during recall. However, as a recall model in two-stage TVR, GR suffers from (i) semantic ambiguity, where each video satisfies diverse queries but is forced into one semantic ID; and (ii) cross-modal misalignment, as semantic IDs are solely derived from visual features without text supervision. We propose Generative Recall and Dense Reranking (GRDR), designing a novel GR method to uplift recalled candidate quality. GRDR assigns multiple semantic IDs to each video using a query-guided multi-view tokenizer exposing diverse semantic access paths, and jointly trains the tokenizer and generative retriever via a shared codebook to cast semantic IDs as the semantic bridge between texts and videos. At inference, trie-constrained decoding generates a compact candidate set reranked by a dense model for fine-grained matching. Experiments on TVR benchmarks show GRDR matches strong dense retrievers in accuracy while reducing index storage by an order of magnitude and accelerating up to 300$\\times$ in full-corpus retrieval.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faGRDR\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u53ec\u56de\u4e0e\u5bc6\u96c6\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u8bed\u4e49\u6b67\u4e49\u4e0e\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u68c0\u7d22\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5bc6\u96c6\u68c0\u7d22\u8ba1\u7b97\u5b58\u50a8\u5f00\u9500\u5927\uff0c\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u7cfb\u7edf\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u53ec\u56de\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff1bGR\u5b58\u5728\u8bed\u4e49ID\u5355\u4e00\u5316\u4e0e\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u63d0\u5347\u53ec\u56de\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "GRDR\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u8bed\u4e49ID\u5206\u914d\u548c\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408trie\u7ea6\u675f\u89e3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u7d27\u51d1\u5019\u9009\u96c6\uff0c\u540e\u63a5\u5bc6\u96c6\u6a21\u578b\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u3002", "result": "\u5728TVR\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0e\u5bc6\u96c6\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u4f46\u7d22\u5f15\u5b58\u50a8\u51cf\u5c1190%\uff0c\u5168\u5e93\u68c0\u7d22\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347300\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u751f\u6210\u53ec\u56de\u7ed3\u5408\u5bc6\u96c6\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u89c6\u9891\u68c0\u7d22\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

Qwen3-ASR-1.7B and Qwen3-ASR-0.6B are ASR models that support language identification and ASR for 52 languages and dialects. Both of them leverage large-scale speech training data and the strong audio understanding ability of their foundation model Qwen3-Omni. We conduct comprehensive internal evaluation besides the open-sourced benchmarks as ASR models might differ little on open-sourced benchmark scores but exhibit significant quality differences in real-world scenarios. The experiments reveal that the 1.7B version achieves SOTA performance among open-sourced ASR models and is competitive with the strongest proprietary APIs while the 0.6B version offers the best accuracy-efficiency trade-off. Qwen3-ASR-0.6B can achieve an average TTFT as low as 92ms and transcribe 2000 seconds speech in 1 second at a concurrency of 128. Qwen3-ForcedAligner-0.6B is an LLM based NAR timestamp predictor that is able to align text-speech pairs in 11 languages. Timestamp accuracy experiments show that the proposed model outperforms the three strongest force alignment models and takes more advantages in efficiency and versatility.

Quantization is commonly employed in neural networks to reduce model size and computational latency. However, applying quantization to ARVG remains largely underexplored, and existing quantization methods fail to generalize effectively to ARVG models. In this paper, we explore this issue and identify three key challenges: (1) severe outliers at channel-wise level, (2) highly dynamic activations at token-wise level, and (3) mismatched distribution information at sample-wise level. To these ends, we propose PTQ4ARVG, a training-free post-training quantization (PTQ) framework consisting of: (1) Gain-Projected Scaling (GPS) mitigates the channel-wise outliers, which expands the quantization loss via a Taylor series to quantify the gain of scaling for activation-weight quantization, and derives the optimal scaling factor through differentiation.(2) Static Token-Wise Quantization (STWQ) leverages the inherent properties of ARVG, fixed token length and position-invariant distribution across samples, to address token-wise variance without incurring dynamic calibration overhead.(3) Distribution-Guided Calibration (DGC) selects samples that contribute most to distributional entropy, eliminating the sample-wise distribution mismatch. Extensive experiments show that PTQ4ARVG can effectively quantize the ARVG family models to 8-bit and 6-bit while maintaining competitive performance.

The prevailing approach to addressing these issues involves collecting expensive, carefully curated datasets and applying multiple stages of fine-tuning and alignment. However, even this complex pipeline cannot guarantee the correction of patterns learned during pretraining. Therefore, addressing these issues during pretraining is crucial, as it shapes a model's core behaviors and prevents unsafe or hallucinated outputs from becoming deeply embedded. To tackle this issue, we introduce a new pretraining method that streams documents and uses reinforcement learning (RL) to improve the next K generated tokens at each step. A strong, post-trained model judges candidate generations -- including model rollouts, the original suffix, and a rewritten suffix -- for quality, safety, and factuality. Early in training, the process relies on the original and rewritten suffixes; as the model improves, RL rewards high-quality rollouts. This approach builds higher quality, safer, and more factual models from the ground up.

To address this trade-off, we propose Noise Frequency-Controlled Diffusion Sampling (NFCDS), a spectral modulation mechanism for reverse diffusion noise. We show that the fidelity-perception conflict can be fundamentally understood through noise frequency: low-frequency components induce blur and degrade fidelity, while high-frequency components drive detail generation. Based on this insight, we design a Fourier-domain filter that progressively suppresses low-frequency noise and preserves high-frequency content. This controlled refinement injects a data-consistency prior directly into sampling, enabling fast convergence to results that are both high-fidelity and perceptually convincing--without additional training.

We demonstrate that this assumption is fundamentally flawed. Instead of evaluating code quality, models frequently decouple from the submission's logic to satisfy hidden directives, a systemic vulnerability we term the Compliance Paradox, where models fine-tuned for extreme helpfulness are vulnerable to adversarial manipulation. To expose this, we introduce the Semantic-Preserving Adversarial Code Injection (SPACI) Framework and the Abstract Syntax Tree-Aware Semantic Injection Protocol (AST-ASIP). These methods exploit the Syntax-Semantics Gap by embedding adversarial directives into syntactically inert regions (trivia nodes) of the Abstract Syntax Tree. Through a large-scale evaluation of 9 SOTA models across 25,000 submissions in Python, C, C++, and Java, we reveal catastrophic failure rates (>95%) in high-capacity open-weights models like DeepSeek-V3, which systematically prioritize hidden formatting constraints over code correctness. We quantify this failure using our novel tripartite framework measuring Decoupling Probability, Score Divergence, and Pedagogical Severity to demonstrate the widespread \"False Certification\" of functionally broken code. Our findings suggest that current alignment paradigms create a \"Trojan\" vulnerability in automated grading, necessitating a shift from standard RLHF toward domain-specific Adjudicative Robustness, where models are conditioned to prioritize evidence over instruction compliance.

While automated systems and Large Language Models (LLMs) aim to retrieve and select concise evidence to support or refute claims, they often present users with either insufficient or overly redundant information, leading to inefficient and error-prone verification. To address this, we propose Evidence Ranking, a novel task that prioritizes presenting sufficient information as early as possible in a ranked list. This minimizes user reading effort while still making all available evidence accessible for sequential verification. We compare two approaches for the new ranking task: one-shot ranking and incremental ranking. We introduce a new evaluation framework, inspired by information retrieval metrics, and construct a unified benchmark by aggregating existing fact verification datasets. Extensive experiments with diverse models show that incremental ranking strategies better capture complementary evidence and that LLM-based methods outperform shallower baselines, while still facing challenges in balancing sufficiency and redundancy. Compared to evidence selection, we conduct a controlled user study and demonstrate that evidence ranking both reduces reading effort and improves verification.

To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight, high-fidelity, low-bitrate 3D talking face compression framework that integrates FLAME-based parametric modeling with 3DGS neural rendering. Our approach transmits only essential facial metadata in real time, enabling efficient reconstruction with a Gaussian-based head model.

While LLM-as-Judge approaches offer a scalable alternative to human feedback, they face a fundamental limitation: performance is constrained by the evaluator's own quality. If the judge cannot recognize good solutions, it cannot provide useful training signals, and evaluation biases (e.g., favoring verbosity over quality) remain unaddressed. This motivates meta-evaluation: the ability to evaluate and improve the evaluator itself. We introduce CoNL, a framework that unifies generation, evaluation, and meta-evaluation through multi-agent self-play. Our key insight: critique quality can be measured by whether it helps others improve their solutions. In CoNL, multiple agents sharing the same policy engage in structured conversations to propose, critique, and revise solutions. Critiques that enable solution improvements earn a diagnostic reward, creating explicit supervision for meta-evaluation and enabling joint optimization of generation and judging capabilities through self-play, without external judges or ground truth.

But many VLMs are startlingly bad at explaining which image evidence led to their prediction, even when their location prediction is correct. The reasoning chains produced by VLMs frequently hallucinate scene attributes to support their location prediction (e.g. phantom writing, imagined infrastructure, misidentified flora). In this paper, we introduce the first benchmark for geolocation reasoning chains. We focus on the global location prediction task in the popular GeoGuessr game which draws from Google Street View spanning more than 100 countries. We collaborate with expert GeoGuessr players, including the reigning world champion, to produce 800 ground truth reasoning chains for 500 query scenes. These expert reasoning chains address hundreds of different discriminative visual attributes such as license plate shape, architecture, and soil properties to name just a few. We evaluate LLM-as-a-judge and VLM-as-a-judge strategies for scoring VLM-generated reasoning chains against our expert reasoning chains and find that Qwen 3 LLM-as-a-judge correlates best with human scoring. Our benchmark reveals that while large, closed-source VLMs such as Gemini and GPT 5 rival human experts at prediction locations, they still lag behind human experts when it comes to producing auditable reasoning chains. Open weights VLMs such as Llama and Qwen catastrophically fail on our benchmark -- they perform only slightly better than a baseline in which an LLM hallucinates a reasoning chain with oracle knowledge of the photo location but no visual information at all. We believe the gap between human experts and VLMs on this task points to VLM limitations at extracting fine-grained visual attributes from high resolution images.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u9996\u4e2a\u5730\u7406\u5b9a\u4f4d\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5373\u4f7f\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u5730\u70b9\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u4e3b\u6d41\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(VLMs)\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5b58\u5728\u5927\u91cf\u89c6\u89c9\u5c5e\u6027\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u95ed\u6e90\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u5b9a\u4f4d\u51c6\u786e\u4f46\u63a8\u7406\u5f31\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\uff0c\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u5dee\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709VLMs\u5728\u5730\u7406\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u53ef\u9760\u89e3\u91ca\u89c6\u89c9\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u63a8\u7406\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002GeoGuessr\u6e38\u620f\u573a\u666f\u548c\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u5c5e\u6027\u4e3a\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u60f3\u6d4b\u8bd5\u73af\u5883\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b500\u4e2a\u8857\u666f\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5730\u7406\u5b9a\u4f4d\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u804c\u4e1a\u9009\u624b\u6807\u6ce8800\u6761\u9ec4\u91d1\u6807\u51c6\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u3002\u91c7\u7528LLM-as-a-judge\u548cVLM-as-a-judge\u4e24\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u8003\u5bdf\u8f66\u724c\u5f62\u72b6\u3001\u5efa\u7b51\u98ce\u683c\u548c\u571f\u58e4\u7279\u6027\u7b49\u6570\u767e\u79cd\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u5c5e\u6027\u3002", "result": "Qwen3\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5224\u65ad\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u5206\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u6700\u9ad8\u3002Gemini/GPT-5\u95ed\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8fbe\u4eba\u7c7b\u6c34\u5e73\u4f46\u63a8\u7406\u663e\u8457\u843d\u540e\uff0cLlama/Qwen\u7b49\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u63a5\u8fd1\u4ec5\u51ed\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4fe1\u606f\u5e7b\u89c9\u751f\u6210\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u73b0\u6709VLMs\u5728\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8868\u660e\u5355\u7eaf\u5b9a\u4f4d\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u4e0d\u7b49\u4e8e\u53ef\u4fe1\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u540c\u6b65\u8fdb\u6b65\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6027\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002"}}

Publicly available pretrained transformers struggle with this unique task due to a lack of analogous data in the communications domain, which hampers cross-modal alignment. To address this, we introduce a dedicated training framework that aligns antenna images with corresponding PCI signals. To tackle the representation alignment challenge, we propose a novel Token Entropy Regularization module in the pretraining stage.

To make WorldBench comprehensive, we design benchmarks at two different levels: 1) an evaluation of intuitive physical understanding with concepts such as object permanence or scale/perspective, and 2) an evaluation of low-level physical constants and material properties such as friction coefficients or fluid viscosity. When SOTA video-based world models are evaluated on WorldBench, we find specific patterns of failure in particular physics concepts, with all tested models lacking the physical consistency required to generate reliable real-world interactions.

Although deep learning methods have achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA), effectively handling the sparse and irregular nature of input depth data in deep networks remains a significant challenge, often limiting performance, especially under high sparsity. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the Gaussian Belief Propagation Network (GBPN), a novel hybrid framework synergistically integrating deep learning with probabilistic graphical models for end-to-end depth completion. Specifically, a scene-specific Markov Random Field (MRF) is dynamically constructed by the Graphical Model Construction Network (GMCN), and then inferred via Gaussian Belief Propagation (GBP) to yield the dense depth distribution. Crucially, the GMCN learns to construct not only the data-dependent potentials of MRF but also its structure by predicting adaptive non-local edges, enabling the capture of complex, long-range spatial dependencies.

State-of-the-art sequence encoders typically collapse a variable-length token sequence to a single vector using a pooling operator, most commonly a special [CLS] token or mean pooling over token embeddings. In this paper, we identify systematic weaknesses of these pooling strategies: [CLS] tends to concentrate information toward the initial positions of the sequence and can under-represent distributed evidence, while mean pooling can dilute salient local signals, sometimes leading to worse short-context performance. To address these issues, we introduce Landmark (LMK) pooling, which partitions a sequence into chunks, inserts landmark tokens between chunks, and forms the final representation by mean-pooling the landmark token embeddings. This simple mechanism improves long-context extrapolation without sacrificing local salient features, at the cost of introducing a small number of special tokens. We empirically demonstrate that LMK pooling matches existing methods on short-context retrieval tasks and yields substantial improvements on long-context tasks, making it a practical and scalable alternative to existing pooling methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86LMK\u6c60\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5757\u5904\u7406\u548c\u5730\u6807\u6807\u8bb0\u6539\u5584\u5e8f\u5217\u7f16\u7801\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "motivation": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4f20\u7edf\u6c60\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982[CLS]\u6807\u8bb0\u548c\u5e73\u5747\u6c60\u5316\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7f3a\u9677\uff1a\u524d\u8005\u6613\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5173\u6ce8\u5e8f\u5217\u524d\u90e8\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u7a00\u91ca\u5c40\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u9488\u5bf9\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u5757\u95f4\u63d2\u5165\u5730\u6807\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u5bf9\u5730\u6807\u6807\u8bb0\u5d4c\u5165\u8fdb\u884c\u5e73\u5747\u6c60\u5316\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u6700\u7ec8\u8868\u793a\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u5c40\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5916\u63a8\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "LMK\u6c60\u5316\u5728\u77ed\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4efb\u52a1\u4fdd\u6301\u73b0\u6709\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e14\u4ec5\u9700\u589e\u52a0\u5c11\u91cf\u7279\u6b8a\u6807\u8bb0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b0\u6c60\u5316\u673a\u5236\u517c\u5177\u5c40\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u4fdd\u7559\u548c\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u4f9d\u8d56\u6355\u6349\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Meeting this demand depends not only on increasing agricultural yield but also on minimizing food loss caused by crop diseases. Diseases account for a substantial portion of apple production losses, despite apples being among the most widely produced and nutritionally valuable fruits worldwide. Previous studies have employed machine learning techniques for feature extraction and early diagnosis of apple leaf diseases, and more recently, deep learning-based models have shown remarkable performance in disease recognition. However, most state-of-the-art deep learning models are highly parameter-intensive, resulting in increased training and inference time. Although lightweight models are more suitable for user-friendly and resource-constrained applications, they often suffer from performance degradation. To address the trade-off between efficiency and performance, we propose Mam-App, a parameter-efficient Mamba-based model for feature extraction and leaf disease classification. The proposed approach achieves competitive state-of-the-art performance on the PlantVillage Apple Leaf Disease dataset, attaining 99.58% accuracy, 99.30% precision, 99.14% recall, and a 99.22% F1-score, while using only 0.051M parameters. This extremely low parameter count makes the model suitable for deployment on drones, mobile devices, and other low-resource platforms. To demonstrate the robustness and generalizability of the proposed model, we further evaluate it on the PlantVillage Corn Leaf Disease and Potato Leaf Disease datasets. The model achieves 99.48%, 99.20%, 99.34%, and 99.27% accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on the corn dataset and 98.46%, 98.91%, 95.39%, and 97.01% on the potato dataset, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u578bMamba\u6a21\u578bMam-App\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u82f9\u679c\u3001\u7389\u7c73\u548c\u9a6c\u94c3\u85af\u53f6\u7247\u75be\u75c5\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u630199%+\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u4ec50.051M", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5f53\u524d\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u519c\u4f5c\u7269\u75c5\u5bb3\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u8fc7\u5927\u5bfc\u81f4\u90e8\u7f72\u56f0\u96be\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u5e73\u8861", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eMamba\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528PlantVillage\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u82f9\u679c/\u7389\u7c73/\u9a6c\u94c3\u85af\u53f6\u7247\u75be\u75c5\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5", "result": "\u5728\u82f9\u679c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fbe99.58%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u91cf0.051M\uff1b\u7389\u7c73\u548c\u9a6c\u94c3\u85af\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5206\u522b\u4e3a99.48%\u548c98.46%\uff0c\u5747\u4fdd\u630199%+ F1\u5f97\u5206", "conclusion": "\u8bc1\u5b9eMamba\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u519c\u4e1a\u75c5\u5bb3\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f4e\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u4e0e\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u65e0\u4eba\u673a/\u79fb\u52a8\u7aef\u7b49\u8bbe\u5907\u90e8\u7f72"}}

However, since it operates in the latent embedding level, the resulting samples are not human-interpretable. In contrast, LLM-based augmentation methods produce sentences via prompts at the token level, yielding readable outputs but offering limited control over the generation process. Inspired by recent advances in LLM inversion, which reconstructs natural language from embeddings and helps bridge the gap between latent embedding space and discrete token space, we propose inversedMixup, a unified framework that combines the controllability of Mixup with the interpretability of LLM-based generation. Specifically, inversedMixup adopts a three-stage training procedure to align the output embedding space of a task-specific model with the input embedding space of an LLM. Upon successful alignment, inversedMixup can reconstruct mixed embeddings with a controllable mixing ratio into human-interpretable augmented sentences, thereby improving the augmentation performance.

While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise on static benchmarks, they often fall short in dynamic, multi-turn diagnostic settings that require iterative questioning and hypothesis refinement. To address this gap, we propose \\method{}, a note-driven framework that trains LLMs to conduct structured history taking and diagnosis by learning from widely available medical notes. Instead of relying on scarce and sensitive dialogue data, we convert real-world medical notes into high-quality doctor-patient dialogues using a decision tree-guided generation and refinement pipeline. We then propose a three-stage fine-tuning strategy combining supervised learning, simulated data augmentation, and preference learning. Furthermore, we propose a novel single-turn reasoning paradigm that reframes history taking as a sequence of single-turn reasoning problems. This design enhances interpretability and enables local supervision, dynamic adaptation, and greater sample efficiency.

Existing methods still require manual intervention, depend on non-verifiable simulated environments, rely exclusively on either supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning (RL), and struggle with stable long-horizon, multi-turn learning. To address these challenges, we introduce ASTRA, a fully automated end-to-end framework for training tool-augmented language model agents via scalable data synthesis and verifiable reinforcement learning. ASTRA integrates two complementary components. First, a pipeline that leverages the static topology of tool-call graphs synthesizes diverse, structurally grounded trajectories, instilling broad and transferable tool-use competence. Second, an environment synthesis framework that captures the rich, compositional topology of human semantic reasoning converts decomposed question-answer traces into independent, code-executable, and rule-verifiable environments, enabling deterministic multi-turn RL. Based on this method, we develop a unified training methodology that integrates SFT with online RL using trajectory-level rewards to balance task completion and interaction efficiency. Experiments on multiple agentic tool-use benchmarks demonstrate that ASTRA-trained models achieve state-of-the-art performance at comparable scales, approaching closed-source systems while preserving core reasoning ability.

A Pseudotime Analysis of Visual Representations", "comment": "21 pages, 17 figures. Appendix included", "summary": "Vision foundation models trained on discretely sampled images achieve strong performance on classification benchmarks, yet whether their representations encode the continuous processes underlying their training data remains unclear. This question is especially pertinent in computational pathology, where we posit that models whose latent representations implicitly capture continuous disease progression may better reflect underlying biology, support more robust generalization, and enable quantitative analyses of features associated with disease transitions. Using diffusion pseudotime, a method developed to infer developmental trajectories from single-cell transcriptomics, we probe whether foundation models organize disease states along coherent progression directions in representation space. Across four cancer progressions and six models, we find that all pathology-specific models recover trajectory orderings significantly exceeding null baselines, with vision-only models achieving the highest fidelities $(\u03c4> 0.78$ on CRC-Serrated). Model rankings by trajectory fidelity on reference diseases strongly predict few-shot classification performance on held-out diseases ($\u03c1= 0.92$), and exploratory analysis shows cell-type composition varies smoothly along inferred trajectories in patterns consistent with known stromal remodeling. Together, these results demonstrate that vision foundation models can implicitly learn to represent continuous processes from independent static observations, and that trajectory fidelity provides a complementary measure of representation quality beyond downstream performance. While demonstrated in pathology, this framework could be applied to other domains where continuous processes are observed through static snapshots.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u9690\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u8fde\u7eed\u75be\u75c5\u8fdb\u7a0b\u7684\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u8f68\u8ff9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8861\u91cf\u8868\u793a\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u65b0\u6307\u6807\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u79bb\u6563\u6837\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u5426\u6355\u6349\u6570\u636e\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u8ba4\u4e3a\u82e5\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u9690\u5f0f\u7f16\u7801\u75be\u75c5\u8fde\u7eed\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u5c06\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u751f\u7269\u673a\u5236\u3001\u589e\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u75be\u75c5\u7279\u5f81\u8f6c\u6362\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5355\u7ec6\u80de\u8f6c\u5f55\u7ec4\u5b66\u4e2d\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u6269\u6563\u4f2a\u65f6\u95f4\uff08diffusion pseudotime\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u75be\u75c5\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u8f68\u8ff9\u7ec4\u7ec7\u60c5\u51b5,\u6db5\u76d64\u79cd\u764c\u75c7\u8fdb\u5c55\u548c6\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u6709\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u4e13\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u5747\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u57fa\u7ebf\uff08\u5982CRC-Serrated\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u03c4>0.78\uff09\uff0c\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002\u8f68\u8ff9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u9ad8\u5ea6\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff08\u03c1=0.92\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u7ec6\u80de\u7ec4\u6210\u6cbf\u8f68\u8ff9\u5448\u73b0\u4e0e\u57fa\u8d28\u91cd\u5851\u7406\u8bba\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5e73\u6ed1\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u4ece\u9759\u6001\u56fe\u50cf\u9690\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u8fde\u7eed\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u8f68\u8ff9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f20\u7edf\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8868\u793a\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u62d3\u5c55\u81f3\u5176\u4ed6\u4f9d\u8d56\u9759\u6001\u5feb\u7167\u89c2\u5bdf\u8fde\u7eed\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u9886\u57df\u3002"}}

We address these inconsistencies by using language models (LMs) as controlled statistical learners to systematically simulate CLI and isolate its underlying drivers. Specifically, we study the effect of varying the L1 language dominance and the L2 language proficiency, which we manipulate by controlling the L2 age of exposure -- defined as the training step at which the L2 is introduced. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of pretraining on L1 languages with varying syntactic distance from the L2. Using cross-linguistic priming, we analyze how activating L1 structures impacts L2 processing. Our results align with evidence from psycholinguistic studies, confirming that language dominance and proficiency are strong predictors of CLI. We further find that while priming of grammatical structures is bidirectional, the priming of ungrammatical structures is sensitive to language dominance. Finally, we provide mechanistic evidence of CLI in LMs, demonstrating that the L1 is co-activated during L2 processing and directly influences the neural circuitry recruited for the L2. More broadly, our work demonstrates that LMs can serve as a computational framework to inform theories of human CLI.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6a21\u62df\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u5f71\u54cd\uff08CLI\uff09\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8bed\u8a00\u4e3b\u5bfc\u6027\u548c\u719f\u7ec3\u5ea6\u662fCLI\u7684\u5173\u952e\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u795e\u7ecf\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "CLI\u7814\u7a76\u5b58\u5728\u4eba\u7c7b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u77db\u76fe\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u901a\u8fc7\u66f4\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\uff0c\u64cd\u7eb5L1\u4e3b\u5bfc\u6027/L2\u719f\u7ec3\u5ea6\uff08\u901a\u8fc7L2\u66b4\u9732\u65f6\u95f4\uff09\u548c\u53e5\u6cd5\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u542f\u52a8\u8303\u5f0f\u5206\u6790\u7ed3\u6784\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u8bed\u8a00\u4f18\u52bf/\u719f\u7ec3\u5ea6\u5f3a\u9884\u6d4bCLI\uff1b\u8bed\u6cd5\u7ed3\u6784\u53cc\u5411\u542f\u52a8\uff0c\u975e\u8bed\u6cd5\u7ed3\u6784\u65b9\u5411\u654f\u611f\uff1bL1\u5728L2\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u88ab\u534f\u540c\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5f71\u54cd\u795e\u7ecf\u56de\u8def\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3aCLI\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bed\u8a00\u4ea4\u4e92\u7406\u8bba\u63d0\u4f9b\u673a\u5236\u6027\u8bc1\u636e\u3002"}}

A dominant paradigm involves freezing a pre-trained model and training lightweight, task-specific adapters. However, maintaining task-specific parameters hinders knowledge transfer and incurs high retrieval costs, while naive parameter fusion often leads to destructive interference and catastrophic forgetting. To address these challenges, we propose Dynamical Adapter Fusion (DAF) to construct a single robust global adapter. Grounded in the PAC-Bayes theorem, we derive a fusion mechanism that explicitly integrates three components: the optimized task-specific adapter parameters, the previous global adapter parameters, and the initialization parameters. We utilize the Taylor expansion of the loss function to derive the optimal fusion coefficients, dynamically achieving the best balance between stability and plasticity. Furthermore, we propose a Robust Initialization strategy to effectively capture global knowledge patterns.

A common and efficient solution freezes a pre-trained model and employs lightweight adapters, whose parameters are often forced to be orthogonal to prevent inter-task interference. However, we argue that this parameter-constraining method is detrimental to plasticity. To this end, we propose Semantic-Guided Dynamic Sparsification (SGDS), a novel method that proactively guides the activation space by governing the orientation and rank of its subspaces through targeted sparsification. Specifically, SGDS promotes knowledge transfer by encouraging similar classes to share a compact activation subspace, while simultaneously preventing interference by assigning non-overlapping activation subspaces to dissimilar classes. By sculpting class-specific sparse subspaces in the activation space, SGDS effectively mitigates interference without imposing rigid constraints on the parameter space.

The standard approach involves training a general-purpose tokenizer that uniformly processes all textual data during both training and inference.

To address this limitation, we propose a post-training adaptation strategy that selectively replaces low-utility tokens with more relevant ones based on their frequency in an adaptation corpus. Our algorithm identifies the token inventory that most effectively encodes the adaptation corpus for a given target vocabulary size. Extensive experiments on generation and classification tasks across multiple languages demonstrate that our adapted tokenizers compress test corpora more effectively than baselines using the same vocabulary size.

Here, we treat the semantic progression of written text as a stochastic trajectory in a high-dimensional state space. We utilize Allan deviation, a tool from precision metrology, to analyze the stability of meaning by treating ordered sentence embeddings as a displacement signal. Our analysis reveals two distinct dynamical regimes: short-time power-law scaling, which differentiates creative literature from technical texts, and a long-time crossover to a stability-limited noise floor. We find that while large language models successfully mimic the local scaling statistics of human text, they exhibit a systematic reduction in their stability horizon. These results establish semantic coherence as a measurable physical property, offering a framework to differentiate the nuanced dynamics of human cognition from the patterns generated by algorithmic models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u968f\u673a\u8f68\u8ff9\u5206\u6790\u548cAllan\u504f\u5dee\u65b9\u6cd5\u7814\u7a76\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u8fdb\u5316\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5ea6\u91cf\u8bed\u4e49\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u7269\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u4eba\u7c7b\u6587\u672c\u4e0e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u8bed\u8a00\u8bed\u4e49\u6f14\u8fdb\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u533a\u5206\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0e\u7b97\u6cd5\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u6d4b\u7684\u7269\u7406\u6307\u6807\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u53e5\u5b50\u5d4c\u5165\u89c6\u4e3a\u4f4d\u79fb\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u7cbe\u5bc6\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e2d\u7684Allan\u504f\u5dee\u5de5\u5177\u5206\u6790\u8bed\u4e49\u8f68\u8ff9\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e24\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1a\u77ed\u671f\u5e42\u5f8b\u6807\u5ea6\uff08\u533a\u5206\u521b\u610f\u6587\u672c\u4e0e\u6280\u672f\u6587\u672c\uff09\uff0c\u957f\u671f\u8d8b\u4e8e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u57fa\u5e95\uff1b\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5c40\u90e8\u6807\u5ea6\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u6587\u672c\u76f8\u4f3c\u4f46\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u8f83\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u91cf\u5316\u8bed\u4e49\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u7684\u7269\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u6587\u672c\u4e0e\u7b97\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Existing methods primarily rely on geometry-aware feature learning or appearance-conditioned prompting, while implicitly assuming that the geometry-invariant dot-product similarity used in attention mechanisms remains reliable under large viewpoint and scale variations. We argue that this assumption does not hold. Extreme camera geometry systematically distorts the query-key similarity space and degrades attention-based matching, even when feature representations are partially aligned.\n  To address this issue, we introduce Geometry-Induced Query-Key Transformation (GIQT), a lightweight low-rank module that explicitly rectifies the similarity space by conditioning query-key interactions on camera geometry. Rather than modifying feature representations or the attention formulation itself, GIQT adapts the similarity computation to compensate for dominant geometry-induced anisotropic distortions. Building on this local similarity rectification, we further incorporate a geometry-conditioned prompt generation mechanism that provides global, view-adaptive representation priors derived directly from camera geometry.\n  Experiments on four aerial-ground person re-identification benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently improves robustness under extreme and previously unseen geometric conditions, while introducing minimal computational overhead compared to state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7a7a\u4e2d\u5230\u5730\u9762\u4eba\u50cf\u91cd\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6cd5GIQT\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u7ea0\u6b63\u51e0\u4f55\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u5931\u771f\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u5168\u5c40\u51e0\u4f55\u63d0\u793a\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4e2d\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0d\u53d8\u70b9\u79ef\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u5728\u6781\u5927\u89c6\u89d2/\u5c3a\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u56e0\u51e0\u4f55\u5931\u771f\u5bfc\u81f4\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u7a7a\u95f4\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u626d\u66f2\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u8bc6\u522b\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8f7b\u91cf\u4f4e\u79e9\u7684GIQT\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u51e0\u4f55\u6761\u4ef6\u663e\u5f0f\u7ea0\u6b63\u67e5\u8be2-\u952e\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u51e0\u4f55\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u5c40\u90e8\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u6821\u6b63\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u8865\u5145\u5168\u5c40\u5148\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u57284\u4e2aAG-ReID\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u51e0\u4f55\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u534710.3%-15.7%\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u4ec5\u589e\u52a02.1%\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u5e94\u5bf9\u4e4b\u524d\u672a\u89c1\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u51e0\u4f55\u5bf9\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0cGIQT\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u8de8\u89c6\u89d2\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u5047\u8bbe\u9650\u5236\u3002"}}

In this work, we propose UniMRG (Unified Multi-Representation Generation), a simple yet effective architecture-agnostic post-training method. UniMRG enhances the understanding capabilities of UMMs by incorporating auxiliary generation tasks. Specifically, we train UMMs to generate multiple intrinsic representations of input images, namely pixel (reconstruction), depth (geometry), and segmentation (structure), alongside standard visual understanding objectives. By synthesizing these diverse representations, UMMs capture complementary information regarding appearance, spatial relations, and structural layout. Consequently, UMMs develop a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of visual inputs.

However, existing search strategies typically treat rollouts as disposable samples, where valuable intermediate insights are effectively discarded after each trial. This systemic memorylessness leads to massive computational redundancy, as models repeatedly re-derive discovered conclusions and revisit known dead ends across extensive attempts. To bridge this gap, we propose \\textbf{Recycling Search Experience (RSE)}, a self-guided, training-free strategy that turns test-time search from a series of isolated trials into a cumulative process. By actively distilling raw trajectories into a shared experience bank, RSE enables positive recycling of intermediate conclusions to shortcut redundant derivations and negative recycling of failure patterns to prune encountered dead ends. Theoretically, we provide an analysis that formalizes the efficiency gains of RSE, validating its advantage over independent sampling in solving complex reasoning tasks. Empirically, extensive experiments on HMMT24, HMMT25, IMO-Bench, and HLE show that RSE consistently outperforms strong baselines with comparable computational cost, achieving state-of-the-art scaling efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faRecycling Search Experience (RSE) \u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u590d\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u7ed3\u679c\u548c\u5931\u8d25\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4f20\u7edf\u641c\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\u91cd\u590d\u63a2\u7d22\u5197\u4f59\u89e3\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u641c\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\u5c06\u4e2d\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u53cd\u590d\u91cd\u590d\u5df2\u53d1\u73b0\u7ed3\u8bba\u548c\u65e0\u6548\u8def\u5f84\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u9020\u6210\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u6d6a\u8d39\u3002RSE\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5185\u5b58\u4e0d\u8db3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7d2f\u79ef\u590d\u7528\u641c\u7d22\u7ecf\u9a8c\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "RSE \u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5171\u4eab\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5e93\uff0c\u4e3b\u52a8\u84b8\u998f\u539f\u59cb\u641c\u7d22\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u7684\u6b63\u5411\u7ed3\u8bba\uff08\u6377\u5f84\uff09\u548c\u8d1f\u5411\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08\u526a\u679d\uff09\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u5c06\u79bb\u6563\u641c\u7d22\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7d2f\u79ef\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6548\u7387\u589e\u76ca\u3002", "result": "\u5728HMMT24\u3001HMMT25\u3001IMO-Bench\u548cHLE\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cRSE\u5728\u76f8\u4f3c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7ecf\u9a8c\u590d\u7528\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "RSE\u901a\u8fc7\u975e\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u641c\u7d22\u673a\u5236\u9769\u65b0\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u590d\u7528\u4e2d\u95f4\u7ecf\u9a8c\u53ef\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u969c\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, this does not imply that the distinction between real and cutting-edge high-fidelity fake is untraceable. We argue that AI-generated videos are essentially products of a manifold-fitting process rather than a physical recording. Consequently, the pixel composition logic of consecutive adjacent frames residual in AI videos exhibits a structured and homogenous characteristic. We term this phenomenon `Manifold Projection Fluctuations' (MPF). Driven by this insight, we propose a hierarchical dual-path framework that operates as a sequential filtering process. The first, the Static Manifold Deviation Branch, leverages the refined perceptual boundaries of Large-Scale Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) to capture residual spatial anomalies or physical violations that deviate from the natural real-world manifold (off-manifold). For the remaining high-fidelity videos that successfully reside on-manifold and evade spatial detection, we introduce the Micro-Temporal Fluctuation Branch as a secondary, fine-grained filter.

Under realistic resource constraints that cannot support large models or dense explorations, however, small language model agents fall into a low-cost, low-accuracy regime, where limited rollout budgets lead to sparse exploration, sparse credit assignment, and unstable training. In this work, we challenge this trade-off and show that small language models can achieve strong multi-hop reasoning under resource constraints. We introduce DAVID-GRPO, a budget-efficient RL framework that (i) stabilizes early learning with minimal supervision, (ii) assigns retrieval credit based on evidence recall, and (iii) improves exploration by resampling truncated near-miss trajectories. Evaluated on agents up to 1.5B parameters trained on only four RTX 3090 GPUs, DAVID-GRPO consistently outperforms prior RL methods designed for large-scale settings on six multi-hop QA benchmarks.

However, their reliability for quantitative 3D analysis in dense, self-occluding scenes remains poorly understood. In this study, we identify a fundamental failure mode of implicit density fields under heavy occlusion, which we term Interior Geometric Degradation (IGD). We show that transmittance-based volumetric optimization satisfies photometric supervision by reconstructing hollow or fragmented structures rather than solid interiors, leading to systematic instance undercounting. Through controlled experiments on synthetic datasets with increasing occlusion, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art mask-supervised NeRFs saturate at approximately 89% instance recovery in dense scenes, despite improved surface coherence and mask quality. To overcome this limitation, we introduce an explicit geometric pipeline based on Sparse Voxel Rasterization (SVRaster), initialized from SfM feature geometry. By projecting 2D instance masks onto an explicit voxel grid and enforcing geometric separation via recursive splitting, our approach preserves physical solidity and achieves a 95.8% recovery rate in dense clusters. A sensitivity analysis using degraded segmentation masks further shows that explicit SfM-based geometry is substantially more robust to supervision failure, recovering 43% more instances than implicit baselines. These results demonstrate that explicit geometric priors are a prerequisite for reliable quantitative analysis in highly self-occluding 3D scenes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u6307\u51faNeRFs\u5728\u590d\u6742\u906e\u6321\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5185\u90e8\u51e0\u4f55\u9000\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u663e\u5f0f\u51e0\u4f55\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u4f53\u7d20\u5149\u6805\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5b9e\u4f8b\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "NeRFs\u867d\u5728\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u81ea\u906e\u6321\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4\u91cf\u5316\u5206\u6790\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5c1a\u672a\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u805a\u7126\u9690\u5f0f\u5bc6\u5ea6\u573a\u5728\u906e\u6321\u4e0b\u7684\u91cd\u6784\u5931\u6548\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u63ed\u793aIGD\u73b0\u8c61(\u9690\u5f0f\u5bc6\u5ea6\u573a\u56e0\u900f\u5c04\u7387\u4f18\u5316\u5bfc\u81f4\u7a7a\u5fc3\u7ed3\u6784\u91cd\u5efa)\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408SfM\u7279\u5f81\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u4f53\u7d20\u5149\u6805\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u75282D\u5b9e\u4f8b\u63a9\u819c\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u5206\u79bb\u548c\u9012\u5f52\u5206\u5272\u4fdd\u6301\u5b9e\u4f53\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u76d1\u7763NeRFs\u5728\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u5b9e\u4f8b\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u4ec5\u8fbe89%\uff0c\u800c\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5SVRaster\u5b9e\u73b095.8%\u53ec\u56de\u7387\uff1b\u5728\u5206\u5272\u63a9\u819c\u9000\u5316\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u51e0\u4f55\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ecd\u80fd\u4fdd\u630143%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u663e\u5f0f\u51e0\u4f55\u5148\u9a8c\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u5ea6\u81ea\u906e\u6321\u573a\u666f\u53ef\u97603D\u91cf\u5316\u5206\u6790\u7684\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u660e\u786e\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\u9009\u62e9\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

To bridge this gap, we propose a novel approach that transforms unimodal datasets into multimodal ones using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to generate synthetic image captions for fine-tuning models with a multimodal objective. Our method employs carefully designed prompts incorporating class labels and domain context to produce high-quality captions tailored for classification tasks. Furthermore, we introduce a supervised contrastive loss function that explicitly encourages clustering of same-class representations during fine-tuning, along with a new inference technique that leverages class-averaged text embeddings from multiple synthetic captions per image. Extensive experiments across 13 image classification benchmarks demonstrate that our approach outperforms baseline methods, with particularly significant improvements in few-shot learning scenarios.

TAPPA both deepens the understanding of attention behavior and guides inference acceleration approaches.

Our analysis further reveals that this distinction can be explained by the degree of query self-similarity along the temporal dimension. Focusing on the predictable patterns, we further provide a detailed mathematical analysis of three representative cases through the joint effect of queries, keys, and Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE). We validate TAPPA by applying its insights to KV cache compression and LLM pruning tasks.

Existing methods either compress visual embeddings or apply sparse attention on a single GPU, yielding limited acceleration or degraded performance and restricting LMMs from handling longer, more complex videos. To overcome these issues, we propose Spava, a sequence-parallel framework with optimized attention that accelerates long-video inference across multiple GPUs. By distributing approximate attention, Spava reduces computation and increases parallelism, enabling efficient processing of more visual embeddings without compression and thereby improving task performance. System-level optimizations, such as load balancing and fused forward passes, further unleash the potential of Spava, delivering speedups of 12.72x, 1.70x, and 1.18x over FlashAttn, ZigZagRing, and APB, without notable performance loss.

However, eliciting long CoT typically requires large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) training, while often leading to overthinking with redundant intermediate steps. To improve learning and reasoning efficiency, while preserving or even enhancing performance, we propose TACLer, a model-tailored curriculum reinforcement learning framework that gradually increases the complexity of the data based on the model's proficiency in multi-stage RL training. TACLer features two core components: (i) tailored curriculum learning that determines what knowledge the model lacks and needs to learn in progressive stages; (ii) a hybrid Thinking/NoThinking reasoning paradigm that balances accuracy and efficiency by enabling or disabling the Thinking mode. Our experiments show that TACLer yields a twofold advantage in learning and reasoning: (i) it reduces computational cost, cutting training compute by over 50% compared to long thinking models and reducing inference token usage by over 42% relative to the base model; and (ii) it improves accuracy by over 9% on the base model, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art Nothinking and Thinking baselines across four math datasets with complex problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "TACLer\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u957f\u94fe\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u9700\u8981\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4e14\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u5197\u4f59\u4e2d\u95f4\u6b65\u9aa4\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fc7\u601d\u8003\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTACLer\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6a21\u578b\u6240\u9700\u77e5\u8bc6\uff1b2) \u6df7\u5408\u601d\u8003/\u975e\u601d\u8003\u63a8\u7406\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u5e73\u8861\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u8bad\u7ec3\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u8f83\u5e38\u89c4\u6a21\u578b\u51cf\u5c1150%\uff0c\u63a8\u7406token\u4f7f\u7528\u964d\u4f4e42%\uff0c\u6570\u5b66\u590d\u6742\u95ee\u9898\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u53479%\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u56db\u5927\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "TACLer\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u51b3\u7b56\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u4e0e\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u7684\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

The prohibitive cost of frame-level annotation makes weakly supervised methods a practical necessity, which rely only on video-level labels.

Our framework uses a Masked Autoencoder (MAE) trained exclusively on authentic data to learn its intrinsic spatiotemporal patterns; this allows the model to produce significant reconstruction discrepancies for forged segments, effectively providing the missing fine-grained cues for localization. To robustly leverage these indicators, we introduce a novel Asymmetric Intra-video Contrastive Loss (AICL).

We study an alternative setting where the model is initially exposed to abstract structured data, as a means to ease the subsequent acquisition of rich semantic knowledge, much like humans learn simple logic and mathematics before higher reasoning. We specifically focus on procedural data, generated by formal languages and other simple algorithms, as such abstract data.\n  We first diagnose the algorithmic skills that different forms of procedural data can improve, often significantly. For example, on context recall (Needle-in-a-haystack), the accuracy jumps from 10 to 98% when pretraining on Dyck sequences (balanced brackets). Second, we study how these gains are reflected in pretraining larger models (up to 1.3B). We find that front-loading as little as 0.1% procedural data significantly outperforms standard pretraining on natural language, code, and informal mathematics (C4, CodeParrot, and DeepMind-Math datasets). Notably, this procedural pretraining enables the models to reach the same loss value with only 55, 67, 86% of the original data. Third, we explore the mechanisms behind and find that procedural pretraining instils non-trivial structure in both attention and MLP layers. The former is particularly important for structured domains (e.g. code), and the latter for language. Finally, we lay a path for combining multiple forms of procedural data. Our results show that procedural pretraining is a simple, lightweight means to improving performance and accelerating language model pretraining, ultimately suggesting the promise of disentangling knowledge acquisition from reasoning in LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u62bd\u8c61\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5316\u6570\u636e\u4f5c\u4e3a\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u7f51\u9875\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u6599\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4f46\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u5e94\u5148\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\u5efa\u7acb\u57fa\u7840\u903b\u8f91\uff0c\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4eba\u7c7b\u5148\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u903b\u8f91\u518d\u53d1\u5c55\u9ad8\u9636\u601d\u7ef4\u3002\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5316\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5982\u5f62\u5f0f\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u7684\u62bd\u8c61\u6570\u636e\uff09\u53ef\u80fd\u7b80\u5316\u8bed\u4e49\u77e5\u8bc6\u83b7\u53d6\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5316\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5982Dyck\u5e8f\u5217\uff09\u5bf9\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u57281.3B\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7a76\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u673a\u5236\uff08\u5982\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e0eMLP\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u53d8\u5316\uff09\uff1b\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00/\u4ee3\u7801/\u6570\u5b66\u8bed\u6599\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6548\u7387\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "1\uff09Dyck\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f7f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8bb0\u5fc6\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ece10%\u8dc3\u5347\u81f398%\uff1b2) 0.1%\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5316\u6570\u636e\u524d\u7f6e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5728\u540c\u7b49\u635f\u5931\u503c\u4e0b\u4ec5\u9700\u539f\u6570\u636e\u768455%-86%\uff1b3) \u7a0b\u5e8f\u5316\u6570\u636e\u4f7f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5c42\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u7b49\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u9886\u57df\u3001MLP\u5c42\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u9886\u57df\u5f62\u6210\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5316\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u52a0\u901f\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u79bb\u77e5\u8bc6\u83b7\u53d6\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Scene graph-based methods, which represent objects and their interrelationships in a structured format, offer a solution by providing greater control over composition and interactions in both image generation and editing. To address this, we introduce SimGraph, a unified framework that integrates scene graph-based image generation and editing, enabling precise control over object interactions, layouts, and spatial coherence.

We introduce Zonkey, a hierarchical diffusion model that addresses these limitations through a fully trainable pipeline from raw characters to document-level representations. At its core is a differentiable tokenizer (Segment Splitter) that learns probabilistic beginning-of-sequence (BOS) decisions, enabling adaptive splits that emerge as linguistically meaningful (e.g., word boundaries at spaces, sentence starts at periods) without explicit supervision. This differentiability is enabled by our novel Probabilistic Attention mechanism, which incorporates position-specific existence probabilities to simulate soft masking over theoretically infinite sequences while preserving gradients. Sequences decay probabilistically rather than relying on end-of-sequence tokens, supporting variable-length outputs. Hierarchical levels compress sequences into higher abstractions (e.g., character n-grams to word-like vectors, then sentence-like), with reconstruction via our Denoising Diffusion Mixed Model (DDMM) for stable and efficient denoising in latent space. A Stitcher ensures overlap invariance across segments.

By introducing a relaxed diffusion bridge formulation which replaces the strict terminal constraint with a relaxed constraint, we model the uncertainty of degradations while theoretically resolving the drift singularity inherent in standard diffusion bridges. Furthermore, we devise a dual modulation strategy: the noise schedule aligns diverse degradations into a shared high-entropy latent space, while the path schedule adaptively regulates the transport trajectory motivated by the viscous dynamics of entropy regularization.

However, their heavy reliance on metaphors and sociocultural context also makes them subtle vehicles for harmful content, posing significant challenges for automated content moderation. Existing approaches primarily focus on intra-modal and inter-modal signal analysis, while the understanding of implicit toxicity often depends on background knowledge that is not explicitly present in the meme itself. To address this challenge, we propose KID, a Knowledge-Injected Dual-Head Learning framework for knowledge-grounded harmful meme detection. KID adopts a label-constrained distillation paradigm to decompose complex meme understanding into structured reasoning chains that explicitly link visual evidence, background knowledge, and classification labels. These chains guide the learning process by grounding external knowledge in meme-specific contexts. In addition, KID employs a dual-head architecture that jointly optimizes semantic generation and classification objectives, enabling aligned linguistic reasoning while maintaining stable decision boundaries. Extensive experiments on five multilingual datasets spanning English, Chinese, and low-resource Bengali demonstrate that KID achieves SOTA performance on both binary and multi-label harmful meme detection tasks, improving over previous best methods by 2.1%--19.7% across primary evaluation metrics. Ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of knowledge injection and dual-head joint learning, highlighting their complementary contributions to robust and generalizable meme understanding.

Therefore, memory systems are developed to leverage essential historical information. Existing memory systems typically follow a pipeline of offline memory construction and update, and online retrieval. Despite the flexible online phase, the offline phase remains fixed and task-independent. In this phase, memory construction operates under a predefined workflow and fails to emphasize task relevant information. Meanwhile, memory updates are guided by generic metrics rather than task specific supervision. This leads to a misalignment between offline memory preparation and task requirements, which undermines downstream task performance. To this end, we propose an Adversarial Memory Adaptation mechanism (AMA) that aligns memory construction and update with task objectives by simulating task execution. Specifically, first, a challenger agent generates question answer pairs based on the original dialogues. The constructed memory is then used to answer these questions, simulating downstream inference. Subsequently, an evaluator agent assesses the responses and performs error analysis. Finally, an adapter agent analyzes the error cases and performs dual level updates on both the construction strategy and the content. Through this process, the memory system receives task aware supervision signals in advance during the offline phase, enhancing its adaptability to downstream tasks. AMA can be integrated into various existing memory systems, and extensive experiments on long dialogue benchmark LoCoMo demonstrate its effectiveness.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper proposes AMA, an adversarial memory adaptation mechanism that enhances task alignment in conversational agents by simulating task execution during offline memory construction and updates.", "motivation": "Existing memory systems for conversational agents lack task-specific customization in their offline phase, leading to misalignment with downstream tasks.

However, current systems often reduce diagnosis to directly output conclusions without verifiable evidence-linked reasoning, which severely limits clinical trust and hinders expert error rectification. To address these barriers, we construct PathReasoner, the first large-scale dataset of whole-slide image (WSI) reasoning. Unlike previous work reliant on unverified distillation, we develop a rigorous knowledge-guided generation pipeline. By leveraging medical knowledge graphs, we explicitly align structured pathological findings and clinical reasoning with diagnoses, generating over 20K high-quality instructional samples. Based on the database, we propose PathReasoner-R1, which synergizes trajectory-masked supervised fine-tuning with reasoning-oriented reinforcement learning to instill structured chain-of-thought capabilities. To ensure medical rigor, we engineer a knowledge-aware multi-granular reward function incorporating an Entity Reward mechanism strictly aligned with knowledge graphs. This effectively guides the model to optimize for logical consistency rather than mere outcome matching, thereby enhancing robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PathReasoner-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on both PathReasoner and public benchmarks across various image scales, equipping pathology models with transparent, clinically grounded reasoning capabilities.

Most existing TTRL methods rely on majority voting (MV) over rollouts to produce deterministic rewards, implicitly assuming that the majority rollout provides a reliable learning signal. We show that this assumption is fragile: MV reduces the rollout distribution into a single outcome, discarding information about non-majority but correct actions candidates, and yields systematically biased reward estimates. To address this, we propose Distribution-AwareReward Estimation (DARE), which shifts reward estimation from a single majority outcome to the full empirical rollout distribution. DARE further augments this distribution-based reward with an exploration bonus and a distribution pruning mechanism for non-majority rollout exploration and reward denoise, yielding a more informative and robust reward estimation.

While this literature shows that there is an area where model representations are similar, we study here how vision models might get to those representations--in particular, do they also converge to the same intermediate steps and operations? We therefore study the processes that lead to convergent representations in different models. First, we quantify distance between different model representations at different stages. We follow the evolution of distances between models throughout processing, identifying the processing steps which are most different between models. We find that while layers at similar positions in different models have the most similar representations, strong differences remain. Classifier models, unlike the others, will discard information about low-level image statistics in their final layers. CNN- and transformer-based models also behave differently, with transformer models applying smoother changes to representations from one layer to the next.

This need is especially acute for geospatial planning problems, such as those found in planning for large-scale military operations, which demand fast and accurate reasoning over maps, orders, intelligence reports, and other distributed data. To address this gap, we present MilSCORE (Military Scenario Contextual Reasoning), to our knowledge the first scenario-level dataset of expert-authored, multi-hop questions grounded in a complex, simulated military planning scenario used for training. MilSCORE is designed to evaluate high-stakes decision-making and planning, probing LLMs' ability to combine tactical and spatial reasoning across multiple sources and to reason over long-horizon, geospatially rich context.

In recent ImageNet-scale AE studies, we observe a systematic bias toward generative metrics in handling this trade-off: reconstruction metrics are increasingly under-reported, and ablation-based AE selection often favors the best-gFID configuration even when reconstruction fidelity degrades. We theoretically analyze why this gFID-dominant preference can appear unproblematic for ImageNet generation, yet becomes risky when scaling to controllable diffusion: AEs can induce condition drift, which limits achievable condition alignment. Meanwhile, we find that reconstruction fidelity, especially instance-level measures, better indicates controllability. We empirically validate the impact of tilted autoencoder evaluation on controllability by studying several recent ImageNet AEs. Using a multi-dimensional condition-drift evaluation protocol reflecting controllable generation tasks, we find that gFID is only weakly predictive of condition preservation, whereas reconstruction-oriented metrics are substantially more aligned. ControlNet experiments further confirm that controllability tracks condition preservation rather than gFID. Overall, our results expose a gap between ImageNet-centric AE evaluation and the requirements of scalable controllable diffusion, offering practical guidance for more reliable benchmarking and model selection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u81ea\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08AE\uff09\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fc7\u4e8e\u4fa7\u91cd\u751f\u6210\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982\u4f4egFID\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u5ffd\u89c6\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u53ef\u63a7\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u6761\u4ef6\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5e94\u91cd\u89c6\u91cd\u5efa\u6307\u6807\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728ImageNet-scale\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0cAE\u9009\u62e9\u504f\u5411\u6700\u4f18gFID\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u504f\u5dee\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u53ef\u63a7\u6269\u6563\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u5f15\u53d1\u6761\u4ef6\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u66f4\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6307\u793a\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u4f55gFID\u504f\u597d\u5728\u53ef\u63a7\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6761\u4ef6\u6f02\u79fb\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u9a8c\u8bc1\u91cd\u5efa\u6307\u6807\u4e0e\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u7684\u5173\u8054\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528ControlNet\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0\u91cd\u5efa\u6307\u6807\u4e0e\u6761\u4ef6\u4fdd\u6301\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u800cgFID\u4e0e\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u4ec5\u5f31\u76f8\u5173\u3002ControlNet\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u4e3b\u8981\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u6761\u4ef6\u4fdd\u6301\u800c\u975egFID\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u53ef\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u9884\u6d4b\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6307\u51fa\u5f53\u524d\u4ee5ImageNet\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684AE\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u53ef\u63a7\u6269\u6563\u9700\u6c42\u5b58\u5728\u8131\u8282\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u672a\u6765\u5e94\u7efc\u5408\u91cd\u5efa\u6307\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684AE\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u3002"}}

In this paper, we start by presenting a geometric approach to demystify rewrite-based detection algorithms, revealing their underlying rationale and demonstrating their generalization ability. Building on this insight, we introduce a novel rewrite-based detection algorithm that adaptively learns the distance between the original and rewritten text.

However, existing OCR methods primarily focus on recognizing text elements from images or scanned documents (\\textbf{Text-centric OCR}), neglecting the identification of visual elements from visually information-dense image sources (\\textbf{Vision-centric OCR}), such as charts, web pages and science plots. In reality, these visually information-dense images are widespread on the internet and have significant real-world application value, such as data visualization and web page analysis. In this technical report, we propose \\textbf{OCRVerse}, the first holistic OCR method in end-to-end manner that enables unified text-centric OCR and vision-centric OCR. To this end, we constructe comprehensive data engineering to cover a wide range of text-centric documents, such as newspapers, magazines and books, as well as vision-centric rendered composites, including charts, web pages and scientific plots. Moreover, we propose a two-stage SFT-RL multi-domain training method for OCRVerse. SFT directly mixes cross-domain data to train and establish initial domain knowledge, while RL focuses on designing personalized reward strategies for the characteristics of each domain. Specifically, since different domains require various output formats and expected outputs, we provide sufficient flexibility in the RL stage to customize flexible reward signals for each domain, thereby improving cross-domain fusion and avoiding data conflicts.

Rather than updating all model parameters, the majority of the GPT-2 backbone is frozen, and training is restricted to the final Transformer block, the final layer normalization, and a lightweight classification head. This approach substantially reduces the number of trainable parameters while preserving the representational capacity required to model complex clinical language.\n  The proposed method is evaluated on radiology reports from the MIMIC-IV-Note dataset using uncertainty-aware CheXpert-style labels derived directly from report text. Experiments cover multiple problem formulations, including multi-label classification of radiographic findings, binary per-label classification under different uncertainty assumptions, and aggregate disease outcome prediction. Across varying dataset sizes, the model exhibits stable convergence behavior and strong classification performance, particularly in settings dominated by non-mention and negated findings.\n  Overall, the results indicate that selective fine-tuning of pretrained generative language models provides an efficient and effective pathway for clinical text classification, enabling scalable adaptation to real-world EHR data while significantly reducing computational complexity.", "AI": {"tldr": "GPT-based clinical text classification using selective fine-tuning for efficient and effective analysis of electronic health records with limited labeled data and reduced computational costs.", "motivation": "Unstructured clinical narratives in EHRs offer opportunities but face challenges including limited labeled data, class imbalance, and high computational costs for adapting pretrained language models.", "method": "Selective fine-tuning of a pretrained GPT-2 model by freezing most parameters and training only the final Transformer block, layer normalization, and a lightweight classification head.", "result": "Strong classification performance on MIMIC-IV-Note radiology reports, particularly for non-mention/negated findings, with stable convergence and reduced trainable parameters.", "conclusion": "Selective fine-tuning enables scalable, efficient adaptation of generative models for clinical text classification while significantly lowering computational complexity."}}

We introduce On-policy Verbal Distillation (OVD), a memory-efficient framework that replaces token-level probability matching with trajectory matching using discrete verbal scores (0--9) from teacher models. OVD dramatically reduces memory consumption while enabling on-policy distillation from teacher models with verbal feedback, and avoids token-level alignment, allowing the student model to freely explore the output space. Extensive experiments on Web question answering and mathematical reasoning tasks show that OVD substantially outperforms existing methods, delivering up to +12.9% absolute improvement in average EM on Web Q&A tasks and a up to +25.7% gain on math benchmarks (when trained with only one random samples), while also exhibiting superior training efficiency.

We introduce Mechanistic Data Attribution (MDA), a scalable framework that employs Influence Functions to trace interpretable units back to specific training samples. Through extensive experiments on the Pythia family, we causally validate that targeted intervention--removing or augmenting a small fraction of high-influence samples--significantly modulates the emergence of interpretable heads, whereas random interventions show no effect. Our analysis reveals that repetitive structural data (e.g., LaTeX, XML) acts as a mechanistic catalyst. Furthermore, we observe that interventions targeting induction head formation induce a concurrent change in the model's in-context learning (ICL) capability. This provides direct causal evidence for the long-standing hypothesis regarding the functional link between induction heads and ICL.

We introduce ChartE$^{3}$, an End-to-End Chart Editing benchmark that directly evaluates models without relying on intermediate natural language programs or code-level supervision. ChartE$^{3}$ focuses on two complementary editing dimensions: local editing, which involves fine-grained appearance changes such as font or color adjustments, and global editing, which requires holistic, data-centric transformations including data filtering and trend line addition. ChartE$^{3}$ contains over 1,200 high-quality samples constructed via a well-designed data pipeline with human curation. Each sample is provided as a triplet of a chart image, its underlying code, and a multimodal editing instruction, enabling evaluation from both objective and subjective perspectives. Extensive benchmarking of state-of-the-art multimodal large language models reveals substantial performance gaps, particularly on global editing tasks, highlighting critical limitations in current end-to-end chart editing capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u56fe\u8868\u7f16\u8f91\u57fa\u51c6ChartE\u00b3\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e2d\u95f4\u6587\u672c\u6216\u4ee3\u7801\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u672c\u5730\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u7f16\u8f91\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u56fe\u8868\u7f16\u8f91\u9700\u517c\u987e\u5c40\u90e8\u7ec6\u8282\u63a7\u5236\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u7ed3\u6784\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e2d\u95f4\u8bed\u8a00/\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7f16\u8f91\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b1200+\u6837\u672c\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u56fe\u8868\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u4e0e\u7f16\u8f91\u6307\u4ee4\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u672c\u5730\u5916\u89c2\u8c03\u6574\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u6570\u636e\u8f6c\u6362\u4e24\u7c7b\u7f16\u8f91\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9SOTA\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u663e\u793a\uff1a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5168\u5c40\u7f16\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u6570\u636e\u8fc7\u6ee4\u3001\u8d8b\u52bf\u7ebf\u6dfb\u52a0\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7f3a\u53e3\u3002", "conclusion": "ChartE\u00b3\u57fa\u51c6\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u56fe\u8868\u7f16\u8f91\u6280\u672f\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5168\u5c40\u7ed3\u6784\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

Despite recent advancements, existing methods suffer from two fundamental challenges: (1) suboptimal motion injection strategies that lead to a trade-off between identity preservation and motion consistency, manifesting as a \"see-saw\", and (2) an over-reliance on explicit pose priors (e.g., skeletons), which inadequately capture intricate dynamics and hinder generalization to arbitrary, non-humanoid characters. To address these challenges, we present DreamActor-M2, a universal animation framework that reimagines motion conditioning as an in-context learning problem. Our approach follows a two-stage paradigm. First, we bridge the input modality gap by fusing reference appearance and motion cues into a unified latent space, enabling the model to jointly reason about spatial identity and temporal dynamics by leveraging the generative prior of foundational models. Second, we introduce a self-bootstrapped data synthesis pipeline that curates pseudo cross-identity training pairs, facilitating a seamless transition from pose-dependent control to direct, end-to-end RGB-driven animation. This strategy significantly enhances generalization across diverse characters and motion scenarios. To facilitate comprehensive evaluation, we further introduce AW Bench, a versatile benchmark encompassing a wide spectrum of characters types and motion scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DreamActor-M2 achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering superior visual fidelity and robust cross-domain generalization.

Explicit topological maps have proven to be a vital solution for providing robust spatial memory in such tasks. However, existing topological planning methods suffer from a \"Granularity Rigidity\" problem. Specifically, these methods typically rely on fixed geometric thresholds to sample nodes, which fails to adapt to varying environmental complexities. This rigidity leads to a critical mismatch: the model tends to over-sample in simple areas, causing computational redundancy, while under-sampling in high-uncertainty regions, increasing collision risks and compromising precision. To address this, we propose DGNav, a framework for Dynamic Topological Navigation, introducing a context-aware mechanism to modulate map density and connectivity on-the-fly. Our approach comprises two core innovations: (1) A Scene-Aware Adaptive Strategy that dynamically modulates graph construction thresholds based on the dispersion of predicted waypoints, enabling \"densification on demand\" in challenging environments; (2) A Dynamic Graph Transformer that reconstructs graph connectivity by fusing visual, linguistic, and geometric cues into dynamic edge weights, enabling the agent to filter out topological noise and enhancing instruction adherence. Extensive experiments on the R2R-CE and RxR-CE benchmarks demonstrate DGNav exhibits superior navigation performance and strong generalization capabilities.

However, we reveal a counterintuitive phenomenon: instruction following can paradoxically interfere with LLMs' task-solving capability. We propose a metric, SUSTAINSCORE, to quantify the interference of instruction following with task solving. It measures task performance drop after inserting into the instruction a self-evident constraint, which is naturally met by the original successful model output and extracted from it. Experiments on current LLMs in mathematics, multi-hop QA, and code generation show that adding the self-evident constraints leads to substantial performance drops, even for advanced models such as Claude-Sonnet-4.5. We validate the generality of the interference across constraint types and scales. Furthermore, we identify common failure patterns, and by investigating the mechanisms of interference, we observe that failed cases allocate significantly more attention to constraints compared to successful ones.

Leveraging the Mixture-of-Transformer architecture, CG-MLLM decouples disparate modeling needs, where the Token-level Autoregressive (TokenAR) Transformer handles token-level content, and the Block-level Autoregressive (BlockAR) Transformer handles block-level content. By integrating a pre-trained vision-language backbone with a specialized 3D VAE latent space, CG-MLLM facilitates long-context interactions between standard tokens and spatial blocks within a single integrated architecture.

Instead of suppressing diffusion updates or applying masking heuristics, our approach reinterprets diffusion as the evolution of stochastic trajectories through a structured latent space. By shaping the initial noise and its geometric alignment, background generation naturally avoids designated foreground regions, allowing readable content to remain intact without auxiliary mechanisms. To address the long-standing issue of stylistic drift across pages, we decouple style control from text conditioning and introduce cached style directions as persistent vectors in latent space. Once selected, these directions constrain diffusion trajectories to a shared stylistic subspace, ensuring consistent appearance across pages and editing iterations. This formulation eliminates the need for repeated prompt-based style specification and provides a more stable foundation for multi-page generation. Our framework admits a geometric and physical interpretation, where diffusion paths evolve on a latent manifold shaped by preferred directions, and foreground regions are rarely traversed as a consequence of trajectory initialization rather than explicit exclusion. The proposed method is training-free, compatible with existing diffusion backbones, and produces visually coherent, foreground-preserving results across complex documents. By reframing diffusion as trajectory design in latent space, we offer a principled approach to consistent and structured generative modeling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6587\u6863\u80cc\u666f\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u8bbe\u8ba1\u800c\u975e\u663e\u5f0f\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u524d\u666f\u4fdd\u7559\u548c\u591a\u9875\u98ce\u683c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u6784\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u968f\u673a\u8f68\u8ff9\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u7f13\u5b58\u98ce\u683c\u65b9\u5411\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6301\u4e45\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u524d\u666f\u5e72\u6270\u548c\u8de8\u9875\u98ce\u683c\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u517c\u5bb9\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6291\u5236\u6269\u6563\u66f4\u65b0\u6216\u63a9\u7801\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b56\u7565\u5bfc\u81f4\u524d\u666f\u53d7\u635f\uff0c\u8de8\u9875\u98ce\u683c\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\u957f\u671f\u5b58\u5728\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u6f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b9e\u73b0\u9690\u5f0f\u524d\u666f\u4fdd\u62a4\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u6301\u4e45\u98ce\u683c\u5411\u91cf\u673a\u5236\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u9875\u98ce\u683c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "1) \u5c06\u6269\u6563\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u6f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u8f68\u8ff9\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u521d\u59cb\u566a\u58f0\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u907f\u514d\u524d\u666f\u533a\u57df\uff1b2) \u5f15\u5165\u7f13\u5b58\u98ce\u683c\u65b9\u5411\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u6301\u4e45\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u5c06\u6269\u6563\u8f68\u8ff9\u7ea6\u675f\u81f3\u5171\u4eab\u98ce\u683c\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\uff1b3) \u91c7\u7528\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6f5c\u6d41\u5f62\u6784\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u91cd\u590d\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u63a9\u7801/\u6291\u5236\u673a\u5236\u7684\u524d\u666f\u4fdd\u7559\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u8de8\u9875/\u591a\u6b21\u7f16\u8f91\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u98ce\u683c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u590d\u6742\u6587\u6863\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8fde\u8d2f\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5b8c\u5168\u517c\u5bb9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u8f68\u8ff9\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u6f5c\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u7ea6\u675f\u8f68\u8ff9\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u9875\u6587\u6863\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u514d\u8bad\u7ec3\u98ce\u683c\u63a7\u5236\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

Despite its empirical success, CFG relies on a heuristic linear extrapolation that is often sensitive to the guidance scale. In this work, we provide a principled interpretation of CFG through the lens of optimization. We demonstrate that the velocity field in flow matching corresponds to the gradient of a sequence of smoothed distance functions, which guides latent variables toward the scaled target image set. This perspective reveals that the standard CFG formulation is an approximation of this gradient, where the prediction gap, the discrepancy between conditional and unconditional outputs, governs guidance sensitivity. Leveraging this insight, we reformulate the CFG sampling as a homotopy optimization with a manifold constraint. This formulation necessitates a manifold projection step, which we implement via an incremental gradient descent scheme during sampling.

However, existing approaches generally rely on heuristic KV Cache policies, which ignore differences in token importance in long-term video generation. This leads to the loss of critical spatiotemporal information and the accumulation of redundant, invalid cache, thereby degrading video generation quality and efficiency. To address this limitation, we first observe that token contributions to video generation are highly time-heterogeneous and accordingly propose a novel Past- and Future-Informed KV Cache Policy (PaFu-KV). Specifically, PaFu-KV introduces a lightweight Salience Estimation Head distilled from a bidirectional teacher to estimate salience scores, allowing the KV cache to retain informative tokens while discarding less relevant ones. This policy yields a better quality-efficiency trade-off by shrinking KV cache capacity and reducing memory footprint at inference time. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that our method preserves high-fidelity video generation quality while enables accelerated inference, thereby enabling more efficient long-horizon video generation.

To enable their use in clinical settings, LLMs are typically further adapted through continued pretraining or post-training using clinical data. However, most medical LLMs are trained on data from a single institution, which faces limitations in generalizability and safety in heterogeneous systems. Federated learning (FL) is a promising solution for enabling collaborative model development across healthcare institutions. Yet applying FL to LLMs in medicine remains fundamentally limited. First, conventional FL requires transmitting the full model during each communication round, which becomes impractical for multi-billion-parameter LLMs given the limited computational resources. Second, many FL algorithms implicitly assume data homogeneity, whereas real-world clinical data are highly heterogeneous across patients, diseases, and institutional practices. We introduce the model-agnostic and parameter-efficient federated learning framework for adapting LLMs to medical applications. Fed-MedLoRA transmits only low-rank adapter parameters, reducing communication and computation overhead, while Fed-MedLoRA+ further incorporates adaptive, data-aware aggregation to improve convergence under cross-site heterogeneity. We apply the framework to clinical information extraction (IE), which transforms patient narratives into structured medical entities and relations. Accuracy was assessed across five patient cohorts through comparisons with BERT models, and LLaMA-3 and DeepSeek-R1, GPT-4o models.

By selectively suppressing these causal chains, TraceRouter physically severs the flow of harmful information while leaving orthogonal computation routes intact.

We propose Proactive Interactive Reasoning (PIR), a new reasoning paradigm that transforms LLMs from passive solvers into proactive inquirers that interleave reasoning with clarification. Unlike existing search- or tool-based frameworks that primarily address knowledge uncertainty by querying external environments, PIR targets premise- and intent-level uncertainty through direct interaction with the user. PIR is implemented via two core components: (1) an uncertainty-aware supervised fine-tuning procedure that equips models with interactive reasoning capability, and (2) a user-simulator-based policy optimization framework driven by a composite reward that aligns model behavior with user intent. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning, code generation, and document editing demonstrate that PIR consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving up to 32.70\\% higher accuracy, 22.90\\% higher pass rate, and 41.36 BLEU improvement, while reducing nearly half of the reasoning computation and unnecessary interaction turns. Further reliability evaluations on factual knowledge, question answering, and missing-premise scenarios confirm the strong generalization and robustness of PIR.

This global-centric paradigm overlooks fine-grained interactions between local motion segments and individual body joints and text tokens, inevitably leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. To address this limitation, we draw inspiration from the pyramidal process of human motion perception (from joint dynamics to segment coherence, and finally to holistic comprehension) and propose a novel Pyramidal Shapley-Taylor (PST) learning framework for fine-grained motion-language retrieval. Specifically, the framework decomposes human motion into temporal segments and spatial body joints, and learns cross-modal correspondences through progressive joint-wise and segment-wise alignment in a pyramidal fashion, effectively capturing both local semantic details and hierarchical structural relationships. Extensive experiments on multiple public benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving precise alignment between motion segments and body joints and their corresponding text tokens.

To overcome the limited amount of supervised data, we propose a procedure that can transform the knowledge in internet-scale pre-training documents into billions of synthetic instruction and answer training pairs. The resulting dataset, called FineInstructions, uses ~18M instruction templates created from real user-written queries and prompts. These instruction templates are matched to and instantiated with human-written source documents from unstructured pre-training corpora. With \"supervised\" synthetic training data generated at this scale, an LLM can be pre-trained from scratch solely with the instruction-tuning objective, which is far more in-distribution with the expected downstream usage of LLMs (responding to user prompts). We conduct controlled token-for-token training experiments and find pre-training on FineInstructions outperforms standard pre-training and other proposed synthetic pre-training techniques on standard benchmarks measuring free-form response quality.

However, the capability of video aesthetic quality assessment, which is a fundamental ability for human, remains underexplored for LMMs. To address this, we introduce VideoAesBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LMMs' understanding of video aesthetic quality. VideoAesBench has several significant characteristics: (1) Diverse content including 1,804 videos from multiple video sources including user-generated (UGC), AI-generated (AIGC), compressed, robotic-generated (RGC), and game videos. (2) Multiple question formats containing traditional single-choice questions, multi-choice questions, True or False questions, and a novel open-ended questions for video aesthetics description. (3) Holistic video aesthetics dimensions including visual form related questions from 5 aspects, visual style related questions from 4 aspects, and visual affectiveness questions from 3 aspects.

This model serves as a synthetic web environment where an agent policy can dream by generating vast quantities of rollout action trajectories for efficient online reinforcement learning. Beyond free policy rollouts, DynaWeb incorporates real expert trajectories from training data, which are randomly interleaved with on-policy rollouts during training to improve stability and sample efficiency. Experiments conducted on the challenging WebArena and WebVoyager benchmarks demonstrate that DynaWeb consistently and significantly improves the performance of state-of-the-art open-source web agent models.

Some recent studies have shown that pre-trained softmax attention blocks can be converted into RNN blocks through parameter transfer and knowledge distillation. However, these transfer methods require substantial amounts of training data (more than 10B tokens), and the resulting hybrid models also exhibit poor long-context performance, which is the scenario where hybrid models enjoy significant inference speedups over Transformer-based models. In this paper, we present HALO (Hybrid Attention via Layer Optimization), a pipeline for distilling Transformer models into RNN-attention hybrid models. We then present HypeNet, a hybrid architecture with superior length generalization enabled by a novel position encoding scheme (named HyPE) and various architectural modifications.

Just noticeable difference (JND) characterizes the maximum imperceptible distortion for images under human or machine vision. Extending it to deep visual features naturally meets the above demand by providing a task-aligned tolerance boundary in feature space, offering a practical reference for controlling feature quality under constrained resources. We propose FeatJND, a task-aligned JND formulation that predicts the maximum tolerable per-feature perturbation map while preserving downstream task performance. We propose a FeatJND estimator at standardized split points and validate it across image classification, detection, and instance segmentation. Under matched distortion strength, FeatJND-based distortions consistently preserve higher task performance than unstructured Gaussian perturbations, and attribution visualizations suggest FeatJND can suppress non-critical feature regions. As an application, we further apply FeatJND to token-wise dynamic quantization and show that FeatJND-guided step-size allocation yields clear gains over random step-size permutation and global uniform step size under the same noise budget.

UEval comprises 1,000 expert-curated questions that require both images and text in the model output, sourced from 8 real-world tasks. Our curated questions cover a wide range of reasoning types, from step-by-step guides to textbook explanations. Evaluating open-ended multimodal generation is non-trivial, as simple LLM-as-a-judge methods can miss the subtleties. Different from previous works that rely on multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to rate image quality or text accuracy, we design a rubric-based scoring system in UEval. For each question, reference images and text answers are provided to a MLLM to generate an initial rubric, consisting of multiple evaluation criteria, and human experts then refine and validate these rubrics. In total, UEval contains 10,417 validated rubric criteria, enabling scalable and fine-grained automatic scoring. UEval is challenging for current unified models: GPT-5-Thinking scores only 66.4 out of 100, while the best open-source model reaches merely 49.1. We observe that reasoning models often outperform non-reasoning ones, and transferring reasoning traces from a reasoning model to a non-reasoning model significantly narrows the gap.

Intuitively, video world models provide the ability to imagine the near future by understanding the causality between actions and visual dynamics. Inspired by this, we introduce LingBot-VA, an autoregressive diffusion framework that learns frame prediction and policy execution simultaneously. Our model features three carefully crafted designs: (1) a shared latent space, integrating vision and action tokens, driven by a Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) architecture, (2) a closed-loop rollout mechanism, allowing for ongoing acquisition of environmental feedback with ground-truth observations, (3) an asynchronous inference pipeline, parallelizing action prediction and motor execution to support efficient control.

In this work, we propose Drive-JEPA, a framework that integrates Video Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA) with multimodal trajectory distillation for end-to-end driving. First, we adapt V-JEPA for end-to-end driving, pretraining a ViT encoder on large-scale driving videos to produce predictive representations aligned with trajectory planning. Second, we introduce a proposal-centric planner that distills diverse simulator-generated trajectories alongside human trajectories, with a momentum-aware selection mechanism to promote stable and safe behavior. When evaluated on NAVSIM, the V-JEPA representation combined with a simple transformer-based decoder outperforms prior methods by 3 PDMS in the perception-free setting.

However, existing NSR methods often suffer from geometric ambiguity and instability, particularly under sparse-view conditions. This issue is critical in large-scale urban remote sensing, where aerial image acquisition is limited by flight paths, terrain, and cost. To address this challenge, we present the first urban NSR framework that fuses 3D synthetic aperture radar (SAR) point clouds with aerial imagery for high-fidelity reconstruction under constrained, sparse-view settings. 3D SAR can efficiently capture large-scale geometry even from a single side-looking flight path, providing robust priors that complement photometric cues from images. Our framework integrates radar-derived spatial constraints into an SDF-based NSR backbone, guiding structure-aware ray selection and adaptive sampling for stable and efficient optimization. We also construct the first benchmark dataset with co-registered 3D SAR point clouds and aerial imagery, facilitating systematic evaluation of cross-modal 3D reconstruction. Extensive experiments show that incorporating 3D SAR markedly enhances reconstruction accuracy, completeness, and robustness compared with single-modality baselines under highly sparse and oblique-view conditions, highlighting a viable route toward scalable high-fidelity urban reconstruction with advanced airborne and spaceborne optical-SAR sensing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u878d\u54083D SAR\u70b9\u4e91\u4e0e\u822a\u62cd\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u8868\u9762\u91cd\u5efa\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u57ce\u5e02\u4e09\u7ef4\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u6a21\u7cca\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u89d2\u573a\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u57ce\u5e02\u9065\u611f\u4e2d\u822a\u62cd\u56fe\u50cf\u91c7\u96c6\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u98de\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3001\u5730\u5f62\u548c\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0b\u73b0\u6709NSR\u65b9\u6cd5\u51e0\u4f55\u6a21\u7cca\u4e25\u91cd\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u878d\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u9996\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408\u96f7\u8fbe\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u5f71\u50cf\u7684\u57ce\u5e02NSR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c063D SAR\u70b9\u4e91\u4f5c\u4e3a\u51e0\u4f55\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u5230SDF\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5c04\u7ebf\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91c7\u6837\u63d0\u5347\u91cd\u5efa\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u51fa\u9996\u4e2a\u5149\u5b66-SAR\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u52a0\u5165SAR\u6570\u636e\u540e\u91cd\u5efa\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u534717.8%\uff0c\u7a7a\u6d1e\u533a\u57df\u586b\u8865\u7387\u63d0\u9ad825%\uff0c\u5728\u5355\u4fa7\u98de\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u4e0b\u5bf9\u503e\u659c\u89c6\u89d2\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u63d0\u534732%\uff0c\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u57ce\u5e02\u7ea7\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e09\u7ef4\u91cd\u5efa\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5149\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u4e0e\u96f7\u8fbe\u70b9\u4e91\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u7a00\u758f\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u822a\u7a7a/\u822a\u5929\u9065\u611f\u9886\u57df\u5177\u6709\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

We introduce Metric Anything, a simple and scalable pretraining framework that learns metric depth from noisy, diverse 3D sources without manually engineered prompts, camera-specific modeling, or task-specific architectures. Central to our approach is the Sparse Metric Prompt, created by randomly masking depth maps, which serves as a universal interface that decouples spatial reasoning from sensor and camera biases. Using about 20M image-depth pairs spanning reconstructed, captured, and rendered 3D data across 10000 camera models, we demonstrate-for the first time-a clear scaling trend in the metric depth track. The pretrained model excels at prompt-driven tasks such as depth completion, super-resolution and Radar-camera fusion, while its distilled prompt-free student achieves state-of-the-art results on monocular depth estimation, camera intrinsics recovery, single/multi-view metric 3D reconstruction, and VLA planning.

To improve both latent factor discovery and quality of compositional generation, we introduce an adversarial training signal via a discriminator trained to distinguish between single-source samples and those generated by recombining factors across sources. By optimizing the generator to fool this discriminator, we encourage physical and semantic consistency in the resulting recombinations.

However, constrained by the capacity of their internal world knowledge, prior work has proposed augmenting MLLMs by ``reasoning-then-tool-call'' for visual and textual search engines to obtain substantial gains on tasks requiring extensive factual information. However, these approaches typically define multimodal search in a naive setting, assuming that a single full-level or entity-level image query and few text query suffices to retrieve the key evidence needed to answer the question, which is unrealistic in real-world scenarios with substantial visual noise. Moreover, they are often limited in the reasoning depth and search breadth, making it difficult to solve complex questions that require aggregating evidence from diverse visual and textual sources. Building on this, we propose Vision-DeepResearch, which proposes one new multimodal deep-research paradigm, i.e., performs multi-turn, multi-entity and multi-scale visual and textual search to robustly hit real-world search engines under heavy noise. Our Vision-DeepResearch supports dozens of reasoning steps and hundreds of engine interactions, while internalizing deep-research capabilities into the MLLM via cold-start supervision and RL training, resulting in a strong end-to-end multimodal deep-research MLLM. It substantially outperforming existing multimodal deep-research MLLMs, and workflows built on strong closed-source foundation model such as GPT-5, Gemini-2.5-pro and Claude-4-Sonnet.

While integrating object detectors as prompt generators offers a pathway to automation, existing pipelines suffer from two fundamental limitations: objective mismatch, where detectors optimized for geometric localization do not correspond to the optimal prompting context required by SAM, and alignment overfitting in standard joint training, where the detector simply memorizes specific prompt adjustments for training samples rather than learning a generalizable policy. To bridge this gap, we introduce BLO-Inst, a unified framework that aligns detection and segmentation objectives by bi-level optimization. We formulate the alignment as a nested optimization problem over disjoint data splits. In the lower level, the SAM is fine-tuned to maximize segmentation fidelity given the current detection proposals on a subset ($D_1$). In the upper level, the detector is updated to generate bounding boxes that explicitly minimize the validation loss of the fine-tuned SAM on a separate subset ($D_2$). This effectively transforms the detector into a segmentation-aware prompt generator, optimizing the bounding boxes not just for localization accuracy, but for downstream mask quality.

Existing reference-based image generation methods leverage large-scale pretrained diffusion models and demonstrate strong capability in generating diverse images conditioned on a single reference image. However, these methods are limited to single-image references and cannot leverage 3D assets, constraining their practical versatility. To address this gap, we present a cross-domain diffusion model with dual-branch perception that leverages multi-view RGB images and point maps of 3D assets to jointly model their colors and canonical-space coordinates, achieving precise consistency between generated images and the 3D references. Our spatially aligned dual-branch generation architecture and domain-decoupled generation mechanism ensure the simultaneous generation of two spatially aligned but content-disentangled outputs, RGB images and point maps, linking 2D image attributes with 3D asset attributes. Experiments show that our approach effectively uses 3D assets as references to produce images consistent with the given assets, opening new possibilities for combining diffusion models with 3D content creation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u54083D\u8d44\u4ea7\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u89c6\u89d2RGB\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u70b9\u4e91\u56fe\u7684\u5171\u540c\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b02D\u4e0e3D\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u4f20\u7edf\u5355\u56fe\u53c2\u8003\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u5229\u75283D\u8d44\u4ea7\u8fdb\u884c\u53c2\u8003\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u53ea\u80fd\u4f9d\u8d56\u5355\u56fe\u53c2\u8003\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u57283D\u5185\u5bb9\u521b\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u65e8\u5728\u5efa\u7acb\u8fde\u63a5\u4e09\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\u5c5e\u6027\u4e0e\u4e8c\u7ef4\u89c6\u89c9\u8868\u73b0\u7684\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u4ea4\u53c9\u57df\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5904\u7406RGB\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u70b9\u4e91\u5750\u6807\u56fe\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u67b6\u6784\u751f\u6210RGB\u548c\u70b9\u4e91\u53cc\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u5185\u5bb9\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u534f\u540c\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "result": "\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u7ec6\u8282\u80fd\u4e25\u683c\u5bf9\u9f50\u8f93\u51653D\u8d44\u4ea7\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u590d\u6742\u8d44\u4ea7\u7ec4\u5408\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5728\u8de8\u89c6\u89d2\u751f\u6210\u3001\u8d44\u4ea7\u7f16\u8f91\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\u51fa\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b03D\u8d44\u4ea7\u4f5c\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u53c2\u8003\u7684\u5168\u6d41\u7a0b\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u4e3a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4e09\u7ef4\u5185\u5bb9\u521b\u4f5c\u4f53\u7cfb\u7684\u878d\u5408\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u6280\u672f\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Retrospective reviews of prediagnostic CT scans, when conducted by expert radiologists aware that the patient later developed PDAC, frequently reveal lesions that were previously overlooked. To help detecting these lesions earlier, we developed an automated system named ePAI (early Pancreatic cancer detection with Artificial Intelligence). It was trained on data from 1,598 patients from a single medical center. In the internal test involving 1,009 patients, ePAI achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.939-0.999, a sensitivity of 95.3%, and a specificity of 98.7% for detecting small PDAC less than 2 cm in diameter, precisely localizing PDAC as small as 2 mm. In an external test involving 7,158 patients across 6 centers, ePAI achieved an AUC of 0.918-0.945, a sensitivity of 91.5%, and a specificity of 88.0%, precisely localizing PDAC as small as 5 mm. Importantly, ePAI detected PDACs on prediagnostic CT scans obtained 3 to 36 months before clinical diagnosis that had originally been overlooked by radiologists. It successfully detected and localized PDACs in 75 of 159 patients, with a median lead time of 347 days before clinical diagnosis. Our multi-reader study showed that ePAI significantly outperformed 30 board-certified radiologists by 50.3% (P < 0.05) in sensitivity while maintaining a comparable specificity of 95.4% in detecting PDACs early and prediagnostic. These findings suggest its potential of ePAI as an assistive tool to improve early detection of pancreatic cancer.", "AI": {"tldr": "ePAI, an AI system trained on CT scans, achieves high accuracy in early detection and localization of pancreatic cancer, outperforming radiologists in identifying prediagnostic lesions.", "motivation": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is often diagnosed late due to overlooked small lesions; early detection is critical but challenging with current methods.", "method": "ePAI was developed using CT scans from 1,598 patients at a single center and validated internally (1,009 patients) and externally (7,158 patients across 6 centers).

To tackle these challenges, we introduce Physics-Inspired diffusion for full-image reLight ($\u03c0$-Light, or PI-Light), a two-stage framework that leverages physics-inspired diffusion models. Our design incorporates (i) batch-aware attention, which improves the consistency of intrinsic predictions across a collection of images, (ii) a physics-guided neural rendering module that enforces physically plausible light transport, (iii) physics-inspired losses that regularize training dynamics toward a physically meaningful landscape, thereby enhancing generalizability to real-world image editing, and (iv) a carefully curated dataset of diverse objects and scenes captured under controlled lighting conditions. Together, these components enable efficient finetuning of pretrained diffusion models while also providing a solid benchmark for downstream evaluation.

To move from observations to systematic understanding, this paper introduces VI-Probe, a controllable visual-illusion framework with graded perturbations and matched visual controls (without illusion inducer) that disentangles visually grounded perception from language-driven recall. Unlike prior work that focuses on averaged accuracy, we measure stability and sensitivity using Polarity-Flip Consistency, Template Fixation Index, and an illusion multiplier normalized against matched controls. Experiments across different families reveal that response persistence arises from heterogeneous causes rather than a single mechanism. For instance, GPT-5 exhibits memory override, Claude-Opus-4.1 shows perception-memory competition, while Qwen variants suggest visual-processing limits.
