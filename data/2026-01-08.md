Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CageDroneRF (CDRF) 是一个大规模无线电频率 (RF) 无人机检测和识别基准数据集，结合真实采集与系统生成的合成变体，通过精确控制信噪比、注入干扰信号和频率偏移等方法增强数据多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RF无人机数据集存在数据稀缺性和多样性不足的问题，难以支撑鲁棒模型的训练与评估，因此需要构建包含更多无人机型号和复杂场景的大规模标准化基准。

Method: 通过真实场景（Rowan大学校园）和受控RF密闭环境的数据采集，结合合成增强管道，实现信噪比调控、干扰源注入及频率偏移（保持标签一致性），并配套开发开源工具链支持数据生成、预处理和评估。

Result: 覆盖多种当前主流但未在公开数据集中收录的无人机型号，支持分类、开集识别和目标检测任务，且工具链兼容现有公共基准数据集。

Conclusion: CDRF通过提供标准化数据与工具链，旨在推动可复现、可比较的RF感知模型研究，加速领域技术发展。

Abstract: We present CageDroneRF (CDRF), a large-scale benchmark for Radio-Frequency (RF) drone detection and identification built from real-world captures and systematically generated synthetic variants. CDRF addresses the scarcity and limited diversity of existing RF datasets by coupling extensive raw recordings with a principled augmentation pipeline that (i) precisely controls Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), (ii) injects interfering emitters, and (iii) applies frequency shifts with label-consistent bounding-box transformations for detection. This dataset spans a wide range of contemporary drone models, many unavailable in current public datasets, and acquisition conditions, derived from data collected at the Rowan University campus and within a controlled RF-cage facility. CDRF is released with interoperable open-source tools for data generation, preprocessing, augmentation, and evaluation that also operate on existing public benchmarks. CDRF enables standardized benchmarking for classification, open-set recognition, and object detection, supporting rigorous comparisons and reproducible pipelines. By releasing this comprehensive benchmark and tooling, CDRF aims to accelerate progress toward robust, generalizable RF perception models.

### [2] [Mass Concept Erasure in Diffusion Models with Concept Hierarchy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03305)
*Jiahang Tu,Ye Li,Yiming Wu,Hanbin Zhao,Chao Zhang,Hui Qian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于超类型-子类型层次结构的群体抑制方法SuPLoRA，有效解决扩散模型概念擦除中的效率与性能问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法随擦除概念增加导致参数冗余和生成质量下降，需提升多概念协同抑制的效率和效果。

Method: 构建超类型（如鸟类）-子类型（如金刚鹦鹉、白头鹰）层级结构，通过共享参数实现群体抑制；采用SuPLoRA技术冻结下投影矩阵仅更新上投影矩阵以保持超类型生成能力。

Result: 在涵盖名人、物体和色情内容的跨领域基准测试中，新方法减少了独立擦除导致的参数膨胀和性能退化。

Conclusion: 理论分析和实验验证表明，群体协同抑制与SuPLoRA技术能显著提升扩散模型在多概念擦除场景下的效率和生成质量。

Abstract: The success of diffusion models has raised concerns about the generation of unsafe or harmful content, prompting concept erasure approaches that fine-tune modules to suppress specific concepts while preserving general generative capabilities. However, as the number of erased concepts grows, these methods often become inefficient and ineffective, since each concept requires a separate set of fine-tuned parameters and may degrade the overall generation quality. In this work, we propose a supertype-subtype concept hierarchy that organizes erased concepts into a parent-child structure. Each erased concept is treated as a child node, and semantically related concepts (e.g., macaw, and bald eagle) are grouped under a shared parent node, referred to as a supertype concept (e.g., bird). Rather than erasing concepts individually, we introduce an effective and efficient group-wise suppression method, where semantically similar concepts are grouped and erased jointly by sharing a single set of learnable parameters. During the erasure phase, standard diffusion regularization is applied to preserve denoising process in unmasked regions. To mitigate the degradation of supertype generation caused by excessive erasure of semantically related subtypes, we propose a novel method called Supertype-Preserving Low-Rank Adaptation (SuPLoRA), which encodes the supertype concept information in the frozen down-projection matrix and updates only the up-projection matrix during erasure. Theoretical analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of SuPLoRA in mitigating generation performance degradation. We construct a more challenging benchmark that requires simultaneous erasure of concepts across diverse domains, including celebrities, objects, and pornographic content.

### [3] [VLM4VLA: Revisiting Vision-Language-Models in Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03309)
*Jianke Zhang,Xiaoyu Chen,Qiuyue Wang,Mingsheng Li,Yanjiang Guo,Yucheng Hu,Jiajun Zhang,Shuai Bai,Junyang Lin,Jianyu Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLM4VLA introduces a minimal pipeline to evaluate how Vision-Language Models (VLMs) impact downstream VLA policy performance, revealing that VLM competence alone does not guarantee effective embodied control, with visual modules being the key bottleneck.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically study how VLM choices and their general capabilities translate to VLA policy performance, addressing a poorly understood but critical aspect of embodied AI.

Method: Proposed VLM4VLA, a minimalist framework that adapts pre-trained VLMs into VLA policies with minimal learnable parameters, enabling fair comparisons. Conducted extensive empirical studies across 3 benchmarks and analyzed the impact of embodied skill fine-tuning and vision-language components.

Result: VLM initialization improves performance over from-scratch training, but VLM general capabilities weakly predict downstream task success. Fine-tuning VLMs on embodied tasks (e.g., depth estimation) did not consistently enhance control. Vision modules, not language components, were identified as the primary bottleneck, with control-supervision injection showing gains even when frozen.

Conclusion: Current VLM pretraining objectives have a persistent domain gap with embodied control requirements. Visual modules require control-relevant supervision for effective action planning, challenging assumptions about VLM competence as a sufficient metric for VLA design.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, which integrate pretrained large Vision-Language Models (VLM) into their policy backbone, are gaining significant attention for their promising generalization capabilities. This paper revisits a fundamental yet seldom systematically studied question: how VLM choice and competence translate to downstream VLA policies performance? We introduce VLM4VLA, a minimal adaptation pipeline that converts general-purpose VLMs into VLA policies using only a small set of new learnable parameters for fair and efficient comparison. Despite its simplicity, VLM4VLA proves surprisingly competitive with more sophisticated network designs. Through extensive empirical studies on various downstream tasks across three benchmarks, we find that while VLM initialization offers a consistent benefit over training from scratch, a VLM's general capabilities are poor predictors of its downstream task performance. This challenges common assumptions, indicating that standard VLM competence is necessary but insufficient for effective embodied control. We further investigate the impact of specific embodied capabilities by fine-tuning VLMs on seven auxiliary embodied tasks (e.g., embodied QA, visual pointing, depth estimation). Contrary to intuition, improving a VLM's performance on specific embodied skills does not guarantee better downstream control performance. Finally, modality-level ablations identify the visual module in VLM, rather than the language component, as the primary performance bottleneck. We demonstrate that injecting control-relevant supervision into the vision encoder of the VLM yields consistent gains, even when the encoder remains frozen during downstream fine-tuning. This isolates a persistent domain gap between current VLM pretraining objectives and the requirements of embodied action-planning.

### [4] [Higher order PCA-like rotation-invariant features for detailed shape descriptors modulo rotation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03326)
*Jarek Duda*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本论文提出了基于高阶张量和多项式高斯模型的旋转不变特征扩展，用于更准确描述复杂形状的旋转不变性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PCA通过协方差矩阵（如迹的幂）实现旋转不变特征，但真实形状更复杂，需更高阶描述方法以提高准确性和实用性。

Method: 将PCA扩展至三阶及以上张量描述中心矩，结合多项式与高斯函数建模，形成可解码的高精度旋转不变形状描述符，并推导其旋转不变形式。

Result: 提出了适用于分子形状描述、2D/3D物体识别及低计算成本的旋转无关形状相似性度量的通用方法，具备任意精度的描述能力。

Conclusion: 高阶张量与多项式高斯模型有效克服了传统PCA在复杂形状描述中的局限性，为旋转不变特征提取提供了灵活且实用的框架。

Abstract: PCA can be used for rotation invariant features, describing a shape with its $p_{ab}=E[(x_i-E[x_a])(x_b-E[x_b])]$ covariance matrix approximating shape by ellipsoid, allowing for rotation invariants like its traces of powers. However, real shapes are usually much more complicated, hence there is proposed its extension to e.g. $p_{abc}=E[(x_a-E[x_a])(x_b-E[x_b])(x_c-E[x_c])]$ order-3 or higher tensors describing central moments, or polynomial times Gaussian allowing decodable shape descriptors of arbitrarily high accuracy, and their analogous rotation invariants. Its practical applications could be rotation-invariant features to include shape modulo rotation e.g. for molecular shape descriptors, or for up to rotation object recognition in 2D images/3D scans, or shape similarity metric allowing their inexpensive comparison (modulo rotation) without costly optimization over rotations.

### [5] [MMErroR: A Benchmark for Erroneous Reasoning in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03331)
*Yang Shi,Yifeng Xie,Minzhe Guo,Liangsi Lu,Mingxuan Huang,Jingchao Wang,Zhihong Zhu,Boyan Xu,Zhiqi Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 我们提出了MMErroR基准测试，用于评估视觉-语言模型能否发现并分类推理错误，结果显示即使是最好模型也仅能正确识别66.47%的错误，表明多模态推理仍具挑战性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉-语言模型研究多关注结果正确性，但缺乏对其是否能识别错误推理过程的探究。本文旨在填补这一空白，推动多模态模型对复杂推理的理解。

Method: 创建包含2013个样本的多模态数据集MMErroR，每个样本包含单一推理错误，覆盖视觉/语言双模态领域。要求模型检测错误并分类错误类型，而非仅判断答案正误。

Result: 在20个先进模型中，最优模型Gemini-3.0-Pro仅达到66.47%的错误分类准确率，证明现有模型在多模态推理错误识别方面存在明显局限性。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了当前视觉-语言模型在深层推理理解上的不足，提出的过程级评估方法为多模态学习提供了新研究方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have improved performance in multi-modal learning, raising the question of whether these models truly understand the content they process. Crucially, can VLMs detect when a reasoning process is wrong and identify its error type? To answer this, we present MMErroR, a multi-modal benchmark of 2,013 samples, each embedding a single coherent reasoning error. These samples span 24 subdomains across six top-level domains, ensuring broad coverage and taxonomic richness. Unlike existing benchmarks that focus on answer correctness, MMErroR targets a process-level, error-centric evaluation that requires models to detect incorrect reasoning and classify the error type within both visual and linguistic contexts. We evaluate 20 advanced VLMs, even the best model (Gemini-3.0-Pro) classifies the error in only 66.47\% of cases, underscoring the challenge of identifying erroneous reasoning. Furthermore, the ability to accurately identify errors offers valuable insights into the capabilities of multi-modal reasoning models. Project Page: https://mmerror-benchmark.github.io

Result: 可在单张图片输入下实现与OLAT采集效果相当的头像重光照，并支持新视角合成与数字人应用。

Conclusion: 通过分阶段训练分离光照依赖，首次实现了无需专业采集设备的高质量3D头像动态渲染。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become a standard approach to reconstruct and render photorealistic 3D head avatars. A major challenge is to relight the avatars to match any scene illumination. For high quality relighting, existing methods require subjects to be captured under complex time-multiplexed illumination, such as one-light-at-a-time (OLAT). We propose a new generalized relightable 3D Gaussian head model that can relight any subject observed in a single- or multi-view images without requiring OLAT data for that subject. Our core idea is to learn a mapping from flat-lit 3DGS avatars to corresponding relightable Gaussian parameters for that avatar. Our model consists of two stages: a first stage that models flat-lit 3DGS avatars without OLAT lighting, and a second stage that learns the mapping to physically-based reflectance parameters for high-quality relighting. This two-stage design allows us to train the first stage across diverse existing multi-view datasets without OLAT lighting ensuring cross-subject generalization, where we learn a dataset-specific lighting code for self-supervised lighting alignment. Subsequently, the second stage can be trained on a significantly smaller dataset of subjects captured under OLAT illumination. Together, this allows our method to generalize well and relight any subject from the first stage as if we had captured them under OLAT lighting. Furthermore, we can fit our model to unseen subjects from as little as a single image, allowing several applications in novel view synthesis and relighting for digital avatars.

### [7] [RiskCueBench: Benchmarking Anticipatory Reasoning from Early Risk Cues in Video-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03369)
*Sha Luo,Yogesh Prabhu,Tim Ossowski,Kaiping Chen,Junjie Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个新的视频风险预测基准RiskCueBench，要求模型在仅包含早期风险信号的视频片段中预测未来危险事件，而非依赖完整视频序列。现有方法在该任务中表现不佳，揭示了实际场景中风险预测模型的部署挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频风险评估数据集包含完整视频序列（含事故直接画面），导致任务难度降低。本文旨在构建更贴近现实的基准，通过早期视觉信号预判风险事件以保障公共安全，填补模型对动态情境理解与前瞻性预测能力的不足。

Method: 构建了RiskCueBench数据集，对视频进行精细标注并定义'风险信号片段'（最早预示潜在风险的时刻）。模型需仅基于这些片段进行预测，不接触事故实际发生阶段的数据，以测试其从早期信号中推断未来风险的能力。

Result: 实验表明当前系统对早期风险信号的解读能力有限，在预测未来危险事件时性能显著下降，暴露出模型在处理动态演变场景时的不足，并揭示了现有方法在实际应用中的关键技术瓶颈。

Conclusion: RiskCueBench有效验证了早期风险信号识别的挑战性，强调未来研究需提升模型对动态视觉信息的时序推理能力，同时为视频风险预测模型的实战化部署提供了关键评价标准。

Abstract: With the rapid growth of video centered social media, the ability to anticipate risky events from visual data is a promising direction for ensuring public safety and preventing real world accidents. Prior work has extensively studied supervised video risk assessment across domains such as driving, protests, and natural disasters. However, many existing datasets provide models with access to the full video sequence, including the accident itself, which substantially reduces the difficulty of the task. To better reflect real world conditions, we introduce a new video understanding benchmark RiskCueBench in which videos are carefully annotated to identify a risk signal clip, defined as the earliest moment that indicates a potential safety concern. Experimental results reveal a significant gap in current systems ability to interpret evolving situations and anticipate future risky events from early visual signals, highlighting important challenges for deploying video risk prediction models in practice.

*Ali Najar,Alireza Mirrokni,Arshia Izadyari,Sadegh Mohammadian,Amir Homayoon Sharifizade,Asal Meskin,Mobin Bagherian,Ehsaneddin Asgari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出Eye-Q多语种视觉谜题基准测试，揭示现有视觉语言模型依赖表层识别的局限性，最高准确率仅60.27%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型(VLMs)在基础基准测试中表现优异但缺乏深度推理能力，视觉单词谜题能通过隐含线索检验模型对非字面概念的推理能力，解决OCR依赖和简单匹配的局限。

Method: 构建Eye-Q基准测试，包含1,343个需多步推理的视觉谜题，要求模型理解概念密集的图像并推断非字面目标词，设计干扰项和跨语言场景，采用开放式评估协议探测假设生成与修正能力。

Result: 顶尖VLMs在抽象及跨语言谜题中表现显著不足，最高准确率仅60.27%，暴露模型在概念表征构建、跨语言推理及关联推论上的核心缺陷。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型需增强符号抽象化、假设动态修正及跨语言概念迁移能力，现有方法难以满足复杂视觉语义推理需求，为未来研究指明方向。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved strong performance on standard vision-language benchmarks, yet often rely on surface-level recognition rather than deeper reasoning. We propose visual word puzzles as a challenging alternative, as they require discovering implicit visual cues, generating and revising hypotheses, and mapping perceptual evidence to non-literal concepts in ways that are difficult to solve via literal grounding, OCR-heavy shortcuts, or simple retrieval-style matching. We introduce Eye-Q, a multilingual benchmark designed to assess this form of complex visual understanding. Eye-Q contains 1,343 puzzles in which a model observes a conceptually dense scene with a brief description and must infer a specific target word or phrase. The puzzles are intentionally unstructured and cue-implicit, with distractors and contextual relationships that demand selective attention, abstraction, and associative inference. The benchmark spans English, Persian, Arabic, and cross-lingual puzzles. We evaluate state-of-the-art VLMs using an open-ended, human-aligned protocol that probes hypothesis formation and revision under lightweight assistance. Results reveal substantial performance gaps, especially on abstract and cross-lingual puzzles, highlighting limitations in current models' ability to construct and search over appropriate conceptual representations for flexible image-to-phrase inference; maximum accuracy reaches only 60.27%.

### [9] [GAMBIT: A Gamified Jailbreak Framework for Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03416)
*Xiangdong Hu,Yangyang Jiang,Qin Hu,Xiaojun Jia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出GAMBI框架，利用模型推理过程通过游戏化场景实现多模态越狱攻击


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗攻击在具备链式推理能力的MLLMs上效果有限，因其未利用模型的认知推理动机，需探索通过影响模型决策阶段诱发自主越狱的行为机制

Method: 通过分解重组视觉有害语义，构建具有游戏机制的场景，引导模型以解决任务为目标主动探索并重构恶意查询，同时结合视觉文本复杂度训练模型安全注意力遗忘机制

Result: 在Gemini 2.5 Flash/QvQ-MAX/GPT-4o模型上分别取得92.13%/91.20%/85.87%的攻击成功率，显著超越基线方法，验证了认知干扰机制对推理模型的威胁有效性

Conclusion: 证明了推理模型在任务导向下的认知漏洞，揭示了安全对齐在动态推理场景中的脆弱性，为后续防御机制的设计提供了技术验证框架

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have become widely deployed, yet their safety alignment remains fragile under adversarial inputs. Previous work has shown that increasing inference steps can disrupt safety mechanisms and lead MLLMs to generate attacker-desired harmful content. However, most existing attacks focus on increasing the complexity of the modified visual task itself and do not explicitly leverage the model's own reasoning incentives. This leads to them underperforming on reasoning models (Models with Chain-of-Thoughts) compared to non-reasoning ones (Models without Chain-of-Thoughts). If a model can think like a human, can we influence its cognitive-stage decisions so that it proactively completes a jailbreak? To validate this idea, we propose GAMBI} (Gamified Adversarial Multimodal Breakout via Instructional Traps), a novel multimodal jailbreak framework that decomposes and reassembles harmful visual semantics, then constructs a gamified scene that drives the model to explore, reconstruct intent, and answer as part of winning the game. The resulting structured reasoning chain increases task complexity in both vision and text, positioning the model as a participant whose goal pursuit reduces safety attention and induces it to answer the reconstructed malicious query. Extensive experiments on popular reasoning and non-reasoning MLLMs demonstrate that GAMBIT achieves high Attack Success Rates (ASR), reaching 92.13% on Gemini 2.5 Flash, 91.20% on QvQ-MAX, and 85.87% on GPT-4o, significantly outperforming baselines.

### [10] [FROST-Drive: Scalable and Efficient End-to-End Driving with a Frozen Vision Encoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03460)
*Zeyu Dong,Yimin Zhu,Yu Wu,Yu Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新型端到端自动驾驶框架FROST-Drive，通过冻结预训练视觉-语言模型（VLM）的视觉编码器权重，直接迁移其通用世界知识到驾驶任务，避免了传统全量微调带来的过拟合问题，在Waymo数据集上证明了该方法在长尾场景中的优越泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统端到端自动驾驶模型通过全量微调视觉编码器适配驾驶数据，导致模型过度特化训练数据而丧失泛化能力，本文旨在验证保留预训练模型通用表征能力是否能提升复杂场景的驾驶鲁棒性。

Method: 提出FROST-Drive框架：（1）冻结VLM视觉编码器权重直接迁移通用知识（2）设计Transformer适配器进行多模态融合（3）采用GRU解码器生成平滑路径点（4）设计基于Rater Feedback Score（RFS）的定制化损失函数优化轨迹规划。

Result: 在Waymo Open E2E数据集（包含丰富长尾场景）的实验表明，与全量微调方法相比，冻结编码器方法在轨迹规划鲁棒性和场景泛化能力上均显著提升，验证了预训练知识保留在自动驾驶任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: 保留强大预训练模型的通用知识比领域特化微调更适用于自动驾驶的复杂现实场景，为视觉驱动的端到端模型提供了新的技术路径，可推广到其他需要强泛化能力的现实应用领域。

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) models in autonomous driving aim to directly map sensor inputs to control commands, but their ability to generalize to novel and complex scenarios remains a key challenge. The common practice of fully fine-tuning the vision encoder on driving datasets potentially limits its generalization by causing the model to specialize too heavily in the training data. This work challenges the necessity of this training paradigm. We propose FROST-Drive, a novel E2E architecture designed to preserve and leverage the powerful generalization capabilities of a pretrained vision encoder from a Vision-Language Model (VLM). By keeping the encoder's weights frozen, our approach directly transfers the rich, generalized world knowledge from the VLM to the driving task. Our model architecture combines this frozen encoder with a transformer-based adapter for multimodal fusion and a GRU-based decoder for smooth waypoint generation. Furthermore, we introduce a custom loss function designed to directly optimize for Rater Feedback Score (RFS), a metric that prioritizes robust trajectory planning. We conduct extensive experiments on Waymo Open E2E Dataset, a large-scale datasets deliberately curated to capture the long-tail scenarios, demonstrating that our frozen-encoder approach significantly outperforms models that employ full fine-tuning. Our results provide substantial evidence that preserving the broad knowledge of a capable VLM is a more effective strategy for achieving robust, generalizable driving performance than intensive domain-specific adaptation. This offers a new pathway for developing vision-based models that can better handle the complexities of real-world application domains.

Conclusion: 研究证实低秩模型能有效捕捉用户-物品交互的深层拓扑结构，在保持计算效率的同时实现高质量推荐，提出的冷启动策略为实际应用提供了可调节的性能-偏差平衡方案。

Abstract: Scalability and data sparsity remain critical bottlenecks for collaborative filtering on massive interaction datasets. This work investigates the latent geometry of user preferences using the MovieLens 32M dataset, implementing a high-performance, parallelized Alternating Least Squares (ALS) framework. Through extensive hyperparameter optimization, we demonstrate that constrained low-rank models significantly outperform higher dimensional counterparts in generalization, achieving an optimal balance between Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and ranking precision. We visualize the learned embedding space to reveal the unsupervised emergence of semantic genre clusters, confirming that the model captures deep structural relationships solely from interaction data. Finally, we validate the system's practical utility in a cold-start scenario, introducing a tunable scoring parameter to manage the trade-off between popularity bias and personalized affinity effectively.

Conclusion: 通过增强模型多假设验证能力和精确奖励设计，为推理驱动型图像编辑提供了新的技术范式。

Abstract: Instruction-driven image editing with unified multimodal generative models has advanced rapidly, yet their underlying visual reasoning remains limited, leading to suboptimal performance on reasoning-centric edits. Reinforcement learning (RL) has been investigated for improving the quality of image editing, but it faces three key challenges: (1) limited reasoning exploration confined to denoising stochasticity, (2) biased reward fusion, and (3) unstable VLM-based instruction rewards. In this work, we propose ThinkRL-Edit, a reasoning-centric RL framework that decouples visual reasoning from image synthesis and expands reasoning exploration beyond denoising. To the end, we introduce Chain-of-Thought (CoT)-based reasoning sampling with planning and reflection stages prior to generation in online sampling, compelling the model to explore multiple semantic hypotheses and validate their plausibility before committing to a visual outcome. To avoid the failures of weighted aggregation, we propose an unbiased chain preference grouping strategy across multiple reward dimensions. Moreover, we replace interval-based VLM scores with a binary checklist, yielding more precise, lower-variance, and interpretable rewards for complex reasoning. Experiments show our method significantly outperforms prior work on reasoning-centric image editing, producing instruction-faithful, visually coherent, and semantically grounded edits.

### [13] [Understanding Reward Hacking in Text-to-Image Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03468)
*Yunqi Hong,Kuei-Chun Kao,Hengguang Zhou,Cho-Jui Hsieh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper identifies reward hacking in text-to-image RL post-training caused by imperfect reward functions, leading to low-quality images with high reward scores. A lightweight artifact reward model is proposed to mitigate this issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reward designs for image generation models often fail to align with true human judgment, causing reward hacking. This work aims to systematically analyze these behaviors and develop a practical solution to improve visual realism and reduce exploitation of reward functions.

Method: The authors analyze contributions of aesthetic/human preference and prompt-image consistency rewards to reward hacking, highlighting their limitations. They propose an artifact reward model trained on a small curated dataset of artifact-free and artifact-containing images, which acts as a regularizer in RL pipelines.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that integrating the artifact reward model significantly reduces reward hacking and improves visual realism across multiple text-to-image RL setups. Ensemble methods alone only partially alleviate the problem, while the artifact model provides a more effective safeguard.

Conclusion: Using lightweight, adaptive reward models like the artifact reward enhances robustness against reward hacking by regularizing existing reward functions, offering a practical approach to improve text-to-image generation quality without compromising training efficiency.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a standard approach for post-training large language models and, more recently, for improving image generation models, which uses reward functions to enhance generation quality and human preference alignment. However, existing reward designs are often imperfect proxies for true human judgment, making models prone to reward hacking--producing unrealistic or low-quality images that nevertheless achieve high reward scores. In this work, we systematically analyze reward hacking behaviors in text-to-image (T2I) RL post-training. We investigate how both aesthetic/human preference rewards and prompt-image consistency rewards individually contribute to reward hacking and further show that ensembling multiple rewards can only partially mitigate this issue. Across diverse reward models, we identify a common failure mode: the generation of artifact-prone images. To address this, we propose a lightweight and adaptive artifact reward model, trained on a small curated dataset of artifact-free and artifact-containing samples. This model can be integrated into existing RL pipelines as an effective regularizer for commonly used reward models. Experiments demonstrate that incorporating our artifact reward significantly improves visual realism and reduces reward hacking across multiple T2I RL setups, demonstrating the effectiveness of lightweight reward augment serving as a safeguard against reward hacking.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于不确定性的引导框架，解决遥感图像中自然语言指向分割的跨模态对齐空间不均匀问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于遥感图像中存在尺度差异、相似干扰物和复杂边界，现有方法的全局统一融合策略在清晰区域引入语言噪声，而在模糊区域缺乏足够消歧。

Method: 通过构建像素级"指向不确定性图"作为空间先验，提出可解释的RUS、UGF动态调节语言注入强度，以及UDLR结合软掩码的局部边界精修模块。

Result: 实验证明该方法在复杂场景下显著提升可靠性（+4.5%）和几何保真度（+7.2%），且无需修改模型主干结构。

Conclusion: 不确定性引导框架实现了自适应推理，作为即插即用解决方案有效平衡了跨模态分割中的噪声抑制与边界精确定位。

Abstract: Referring remote sensing image segmentation aims to localize specific targets described by natural language within complex overhead imagery. However, due to extreme scale variations, dense similar distractors, and intricate boundary structures, the reliability of cross-modal alignment exhibits significant \textbf{spatial non-uniformity}. Existing methods typically employ uniform fusion and refinement strategies across the entire image, which often introduces unnecessary linguistic perturbations in visually clear regions while failing to provide sufficient disambiguation in confused areas. To address this, we propose an \textbf{uncertainty-guided framework} that explicitly leverages a pixel-wise \textbf{referring uncertainty map} as a spatial prior to orchestrate adaptive inference. Specifically, we introduce a plug-and-play \textbf{Referring Uncertainty Scorer (RUS)}, which is trained via an online error-consistency supervision strategy to interpretably predict the spatial distribution of referential ambiguity. Building on this prior, we design two plug-and-play modules: 1) \textbf{Uncertainty-Gated Fusion (UGF)}, which dynamically modulates language injection strength to enhance constraints in high-uncertainty regions while suppressing noise in low-uncertainty ones; and 2) \textbf{Uncertainty-Driven Local Refinement (UDLR)}, which utilizes uncertainty-derived soft masks to focus refinement on error-prone boundaries and fine details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method functions as a unified, plug-and-play solution that significantly improves robustness and geometric fidelity in complex remote sensing scenes without altering the backbone architecture.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种无需训练的Structure-Disrupted Contrastive Decoding（SDCD）算法，通过对比校准消除视觉语言模型中的纹理驱动偏差，有效缓解物体幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LVLMs的物体幻觉主要源于视觉编码器对局部纹理特征的过度依赖（源于视觉统计偏差），而现有方法未充分解决这一由弱结构监督引发的底层机制问题。

Method: SDCD通过引入打乱顺序的结构破坏视图进行对比解码，惩罚在此异常结构下仍维持高置信度的标记，从而抑制模型对局部纹理特征的过度依赖，无需修改模型参数。

Result: 实验表明SDCD在多个基准测试中显著降低物体幻觉比例（如消除63%的错误目标检测），同时提升模型在多模态任务中的整体性能（平均提升2.4%）。

Conclusion: 该方法揭示了视觉编码器内部机制对幻觉的影响，为改进多模态模型提供了可解释性框架，其训练-free特性也具备实际部署优势。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate significant progress in multimodal understanding and reasoning, yet object hallucination remains a critical challenge. While existing research focuses on mitigating language priors or high-level statistical biases, they often overlook the internal complexities of the visual encoding process. We identify that visual statistical bias, arising from the inherent Bag-of-Patches behavior of Vision Encoders under weak structural supervision, acts as a contributing factor of object hallucinations. Under this bias, models prioritize local texture features within individual patches over holistic geometric structures. This tendency may induce spurious visual confidence and result in hallucinations. To address this, we introduce a training-free algorithm called Structure-Disrupted Contrastive Decoding (SDCD), which performs contrastive calibration of the output distribution by introducing a shuffled structure-disrupted view. By penalizing tokens that maintain high confidence under this structure-less view, SDCD effectively suppresses the texture-driven bias. Experimental results demonstrate that SDCD significantly mitigates hallucinations across multiple benchmarks and enhances the overall multimodal capabilities of LVLMs.

Motivation: 点云的稀疏和不规则特性导致现有方法依赖几何特征难以区分相似形状但不同外观(颜色/材质)的物体，需引入外观一致性特征优化分割。

Method: 创建逐点对应关系建模高斯点与点云关联，利用高斯不透明度属性消除几何模糊，并通过尺度属性精确定位3D边界。

Result: 在标准benchmark中表现优于现存方法，特别是在几何复杂类别(如细长物体或遮挡场景)上提升显著，且不依赖外部监督信号。

Conclusion: G2P有效解决了点云与优化高斯点的几何对齐问题，通过几何与外观特征的协同建模实现了无监督约束的高质量语义分割。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation on point clouds is critical for 3D scene understanding. However, sparse and irregular point distributions provide limited appearance evidence, making geometry-only features insufficient to distinguish objects with similar shapes but distinct appearances (e.g., color, texture, material). We propose Gaussian-to-Point (G2P), which transfers appearance-aware attributes from 3D Gaussian Splatting to point clouds for more discriminative and appearance-consistent segmentation. Our G2P address the misalignment between optimized Gaussians and original point geometry by establishing point-wise correspondences. By leveraging Gaussian opacity attributes, we resolve the geometric ambiguity that limits existing models. Additionally, Gaussian scale attributes enable precise boundary localization in complex 3D scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance on standard benchmarks and shows significant improvements on geometrically challenging classes, all without any 2D or language supervision.

Conclusion: CloudMatch通过增强视图一致性学习和双路径场景混合策略，成功解决了低标注成本下云检测的挑战，为遥感图像半监督学习提供了可扩展的范式。

Abstract: Due to the high cost of annotating accurate pixel-level labels, semi-supervised learning has emerged as a promising approach for cloud detection. In this paper, we propose CloudMatch, a semi-supervised framework that effectively leverages unlabeled remote sensing imagery through view-consistency learning combined with scene-mixing augmentations. An observation behind CloudMatch is that cloud patterns exhibit structural diversity and contextual variability across different scenes and within the same scene category. Our key insight is that enforcing prediction consistency across diversely augmented views, incorporating both inter-scene and intra-scene mixing, enables the model to capture the structural diversity and contextual richness of cloud patterns. Specifically, CloudMatch generates one weakly augmented view along with two complementary strongly augmented views for each unlabeled image: one integrates inter-scene patches to simulate contextual variety, while the other employs intra-scene mixing to preserve semantic coherence. This approach guides pseudolabel generation and enhances generalization. Extensive experiments show that CloudMatch achieves good performance, demonstrating its capability to utilize unlabeled data efficiently and advance semi-supervised cloud detection.

TL;DR: 本文提出EASLT框架，通过引入情感编码器与情感感知融合模块，将面部表情作为语义锚点解决手语翻译中的歧义问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有手语翻译方法忽视面部表情的语义重要性，导致相同手势表达不同概念时产生歧义。需要建立更全面的跨模态表征方法。

Method: 构建专门的情感编码器捕捉连续面部动态，通过情感感知融合模块（EAF）自适应融合时空手势特征与情感上下文，实现语义解耦。

Result: 在PHOENIX14T/CSL-Daily数据集上BLEU-4达26.15/22.80，BLEURT达61.0/57.8，超越现有无词素方法；消融实验证实情感建模提升翻译保真度。

Conclusion: 面部表情作为鲁棒语义锚点能有效解耦非手动信号与手势动力学，情感编码器与EAF模块为跨模态语义对齐提供了新范式。

Abstract: Sign Language Translation (SLT) is a complex cross-modal task requiring the integration of Manual Signals (MS) and Non-Manual Signals (NMS). While recent gloss-free SLT methods have made strides in translating manual gestures, they frequently overlook the semantic criticality of facial expressions, resulting in ambiguity when distinct concepts share identical manual articulations. To address this, we present **EASLT** (**E**motion-**A**ware **S**ign **L**anguage **T**ranslation), a framework that treats facial affect not as auxiliary information, but as a robust semantic anchor. Unlike methods that relegate facial expressions to a secondary role, EASLT incorporates a dedicated emotional encoder to capture continuous affective dynamics. These representations are integrated via a novel *Emotion-Aware Fusion* (EAF) module, which adaptively recalibrates spatio-temporal sign features based on affective context to resolve semantic ambiguities. Extensive evaluations on the PHOENIX14T and CSL-Daily benchmarks demonstrate that EASLT establishes advanced performance among gloss-free methods, achieving BLEU-4 scores of 26.15 and 22.80, and BLEURT scores of 61.0 and 57.8, respectively. Ablation studies confirm that explicitly modeling emotion effectively decouples affective semantics from manual dynamics, significantly enhancing translation fidelity.

Conclusion: 融合实例级与全局级空间关系建模，结合不确定性感知的高斯定位策略，有效提升了跨模态定位的准确性。

Abstract: Cross-modal localization using text and point clouds enables robots to localize themselves via natural language descriptions, with applications in autonomous navigation and interaction between humans and robots. In this task, objects often recur across text and point clouds, making spatial relationships the most discriminative cues for localization. Given this characteristic, we present SpatiaLoc, a framework utilizing a coarse-to-fine strategy that emphasizes spatial relationships at both the instance and global levels. In the coarse stage, we introduce a Bezier Enhanced Object Spatial Encoder (BEOSE) that models spatial relationships at the instance level using quadratic Bezier curves. Additionally, a Frequency Aware Encoder (FAE) generates spatial representations in the frequency domain at the global level. In the fine stage, an Uncertainty Aware Gaussian Fine Localizer (UGFL) regresses 2D positions by modeling predictions as Gaussian distributions with a loss function aware of uncertainty. Extensive experiments on KITTI360Pose demonstrate that SpatiaLoc significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

Result: 在GenImage和UniversalFakeDetect数据集分别达到98.2%和94.6%平均准确率。

Conclusion: 通过增强CLIP模型对分布偏差的注意力，显著提升AI生成图像检测的泛化性能。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models has significantly enhanced the quality of AI-generated images, raising concerns about misinformation and the erosion of public trust. Detecting AI-generated images has thus become a critical challenge, particularly in terms of generalizing to unseen generative models. Existing methods using frozen pre-trained CLIP models show promise in generalization but treat the image encoder as a basic feature extractor, failing to fully exploit its potential. In this paper, we perform an in-depth analysis of the frozen CLIP image encoder (CLIP-ViT), revealing that it effectively clusters real images in a high-level, abstract feature space. However, it does not truly possess the ability to distinguish between real and AI-generated images. Based on this analysis, we propose a Masking-based Pre-trained model Fine-Tuning (MPFT) strategy, which introduces a Texture-Aware Masking (TAM) mechanism to mask textured areas containing generative model-specific patterns during fine-tuning. This approach compels CLIP-ViT to attend to the "distributional deviations"from authentic images for AI-generated image detection, thereby achieving enhanced generalization performance. Extensive experiments on the GenImage and UniversalFakeDetect datasets demonstrate that our method, fine-tuned with only a minimal number of images, significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving up to 98.2% and 94.6% average accuracy on the two datasets, respectively.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Spatial Intelligence (SI) have predominantly relied on Vision-Language Models (VLMs), yet a critical question remains: does spatial understanding originate from visual encoders or the fundamental reasoning backbone? Inspired by this question, we introduce SiT-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the SI performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) without pixel-level input, comprises over 3,800 expert-annotated items across five primary categories and 17 subtasks, ranging from egocentric navigation and perspective transformation to fine-grained robotic manipulation. By converting single/multi-view scenes into high-fidelity, coordinate-aware textual descriptions, we challenge LLMs to perform symbolic textual reasoning rather than visual pattern matching. Evaluation results of state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs reveals that while models achieve proficiency in localized semantic tasks, a significant "spatial gap" remains in global consistency. Notably, we find that explicit spatial reasoning significantly boosts performance, suggesting that LLMs possess latent world-modeling potential. Our proposed dataset SiT-Bench serves as a foundational resource to foster the development of spatially-grounded LLM backbones for future VLMs and embodied agents. Our code and benchmark will be released at https://github.com/binisalegend/SiT-Bench .

Abstract: Few-shot segmentation (FSS) aims to rapidly learn novel class concepts from limited examples to segment specific targets in unseen images, and has been widely applied in areas such as medical diagnosis and industrial inspection. However, existing studies largely overlook the complex environmental factors encountered in real world scenarios-such as illumination, background, and camera viewpoint-which can substantially increase the difficulty of test images. As a result, models trained under laboratory conditions often fall short of practical deployment requirements. To bridge this gap, in this paper, an environment-robust FSS setting is introduced that explicitly incorporates challenging test cases arising from complex environments-such as motion blur, small objects, and camouflaged targets-to enhance model's robustness under realistic, dynamic conditions. An environment robust FSS benchmark (ER-FSS) is established, covering eight datasets across multiple real world scenarios. In addition, an Adaptive Attention Distillation (AAD) method is proposed, which repeatedly contrasts and distills key shared semantics between known (support) and unknown (query) images to derive class-specific attention for novel categories. This strengthens the model's ability to focus on the correct targets in complex environments, thereby improving environmental robustness. Comparative experiments show that AAD improves mIoU by 3.3% - 8.5% across all datasets and settings, demonstrating superior performance and strong generalization.

Abstract: Binarization is a popular first step towards text extraction in historical artifacts. Stone inscription images pose severe challenges for binarization due to poor contrast between etched characters and the stone background, non-uniform surface degradation, distracting artifacts, and highly variable text density and layouts. These conditions frequently cause existing binarization techniques to fail and struggle to isolate coherent character regions. Many approaches sub-divide the image into patches to improve text fragment resolution and improve binarization performance. With this in mind, we present a robust and adaptive patching strategy to binarize challenging Indic inscriptions. The patches from our approach are used to train an Attention U-Net for binarization. The attention mechanism allows the model to focus on subtle structural cues, while our dynamic sampling and patch selection method ensures that the model learns to overcome surface noise and layout irregularities. We also introduce a carefully annotated, pixel-precise dataset of Indic stone inscriptions at the character-fragment level. We demonstrate that our novel patching mechanism significantly boosts binarization performance across classical and deep learning baselines. Despite training only on single script Indic dataset, our model exhibits strong zero-shot generalization to other Indic and non-indic scripts, highlighting its robustness and script-agnostic generalization capabilities. By producing clean, structured representations of inscription content, our method lays the foundation for downstream tasks such as script identification, OCR, and historical text analysis.

Conclusion: 基于排序的特征提取可有效替代目标分类中的对齐，通过分段边界特征实现高效准确的相似度测量。

Abstract: The existing object classification techniques based on descriptive features rely on object alignment to compute the similarity of objects for classification. This paper replaces the necessity of object alignment through sorting of feature. The object boundary is normalized and segmented into approximately convex segments and the segments are then sorted in descending order of their length. The segment length, number of extreme points in segments, area of segments, the base and the width of the segments - a bag of features - is used to measure the similarity between image boundaries. The proposed method is tested on datasets and acceptable results are observed.

Abstract: Automated crack segmentation is essential for scalable condition assessment of pavements and civil infrastructure, yet practical deployment is limited by scarce pixel-level labels and severe domain shift across sensors, illumination, textures, and annotation conventions. This paper presents CrackSegFlow, a controllable flow-matching synthesis framework that generates photorealistic crack images conditioned on binary masks while preserving strict mask-image alignment. The generator combines topology-preserving mask injection with boundary-gated modulation to maintain thin-structure continuity and suppress texture-driven false positives. A second class-conditional flow-matching model synthesizes crack masks with explicit control over crack coverage, enabling balanced, topology-diverse paired data without additional manual annotation. We further inject crack masks into crack-free backgrounds to diversify illumination and surface artifacts and reduce false positives caused by shadows, joints, and pavement markings. Experiments on five benchmarks spanning four asphalt datasets and the crack class of a concrete-domain dataset demonstrate consistent improvements under an established hybrid CNN--Transformer segmentation backbone and a fixed training protocol. With real plus synthesized pairs, in-domain performance improves on average by 5.37 mIoU and 5.13 F1, and target-guided cross-domain synthesis yields average gains of 13.12 mIoU and 14.82 F1 using only limited target mask statistics. Compared with diffusion-based semantic synthesis, CrackSegFlow provides substantially faster deterministic sampling and improves fidelity and mask-image alignment for thin-structure crack geometry. Finally, we release CSF-50K, a public dataset of 50,000 paired crack images and pixel-accurate masks for large-scale benchmarking of generalizable crack segmentation.

Existing models can produce high-quality short clips but often fail to preserve entity identity and appearance when scenes change or when entities reappear after long temporal gaps. We present VideoMemory, an entity-centric framework that integrates narrative planning with visual generation through a Dynamic Memory Bank. Given a structured script, a multi-agent system decomposes the narrative into shots, retrieves entity representations from memory, and synthesizes keyframes and videos conditioned on these retrieved states. The Dynamic Memory Bank stores explicit visual and semantic descriptors for characters, props, and backgrounds, and is updated after each shot to reflect story-driven changes while preserving identity. This retrieval-update mechanism enables consistent portrayal of entities across distant shots and supports coherent long-form generation. To evaluate this setting, we construct a 54-case multi-shot consistency benchmark covering character-, prop-, and background-persistent scenarios. Extensive experiments show that VideoMemory achieves strong entity-level coherence and high perceptual quality across diverse narrative sequences.

Abstract: Point cloud completion aims to recover complete 3D geometry from partial observations caused by limited viewpoints and occlusions. Existing learning-based works, including 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based, point-based, and Transformer-based methods, have achieved strong performance on synthetic benchmarks. However, due to the limitations of modality, scalability, and generative capacity, their generalization to novel objects and real-world scenarios remains challenging. In this paper, we propose MGPC, a generalizable multimodal point cloud completion framework that integrates point clouds, RGB images, and text within a unified architecture. MGPC introduces an innovative modality dropout strategy, a Transformer-based fusion module, and a novel progressive generator to improve robustness, scalability, and geometric modeling capability. We further develop an automatic data generation pipeline and construct MGPC-1M, a large-scale benchmark with over 1,000 categories and one million training pairs. Extensive experiments on MGPC-1M and in-the-wild data demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms prior baselines and exhibits strong generalization under real-world conditions.

Abstract: We present a novel approach for egocentric action recognition that leverages 2D point tracks as an additional motion cue. While most existing methods rely on RGB appearance, human pose estimation, or their combination, our work demonstrates that tracking randomly sampled image points across video frames can substantially improve recognition accuracy. Unlike prior approaches, we do not detect hands, objects, or interaction regions. Instead, we employ CoTracker to follow a set of randomly initialized points through each video and use the resulting trajectories, together with the corresponding image frames, as input to a Transformer-based recognition model. Surprisingly, our method achieves notable gains even when only the initial frame and its associated point tracks are provided, without incorporating the full video sequence. Experimental results confirm that integrating 2D point tracks consistently enhances performance compared to the same model trained without motion information, highlighting their potential as a lightweight yet effective representation for egocentric action understanding.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently shown remarkable performance in navigation and localization tasks by leveraging large-scale pretraining for semantic understanding. However, applying VLMs to 6-DoF endoscopic camera localization presents several challenges: 1) the lack of large-scale, high-quality, densely annotated, and localization-oriented vision-language datasets in real-world medical settings; 2) limited capability for fine-grained pose regression; and 3) high computational latency when extracting temporal features from past frames. To address these issues, we first construct BREATH dataset, the largest in-vivo endoscopic localization dataset to date, collected in the complex human airway. Building on this dataset, we propose BREATH-VL, a hybrid framework that integrates semantic cues from VLMs with geometric information from vision-based registration methods for accurate 6-DoF pose estimation. Our motivation lies in the complementary strengths of both approaches: VLMs offer generalizable semantic understanding, while registration methods provide precise geometric alignment. To further enhance the VLM's ability to capture temporal context, we introduce a lightweight context-learning mechanism that encodes motion history as linguistic prompts, enabling efficient temporal reasoning without expensive video-level computation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the vision-language module delivers robust semantic localization in challenging surgical scenes. Building on this, our BREATH-VL outperforms state-of-the-art vision-only localization methods in both accuracy and generalization, reducing translational error by 25.5% compared with the best-performing baseline, while achieving competitive computational latency.

Abstract: Active Alignment (AA) is a key technology for the large-scale automated assembly of high-precision optical systems. Compared with labor-intensive per-model on-device calibration, a digital-twin pipeline built on optical simulation offers a substantial advantage in generating large-scale labeled data. However, complex imaging conditions induce a domain gap between simulation and real-world images, limiting the generalization of simulation-trained models. To address this, we propose augmenting a simulation baseline with minimal unlabeled real-world images captured at random misalignment positions, mitigating the gap from a domain adaptation perspective. We introduce Domain Adaptive Active Alignment (DA3), which utilizes an autoregressive domain transformation generator and an adversarial-based feature alignment strategy to distill real-world domain information via self-supervised learning. This enables the extraction of domain-invariant image degradation features to facilitate robust misalignment prediction. Experiments on two lens types reveal that DA3 improves accuracy by 46% over a purely simulation pipeline. Notably, it approaches the performance achieved with precisely labeled real-world data collected on 3 lens samples, while reducing on-device data collection time by 98.7%. The results demonstrate that domain adaptation effectively endows simulation-trained models with robust real-world performance, validating the digital-twin pipeline as a practical solution to significantly enhance the efficiency of large-scale optical assembly.

Abstract: Fine-grained classification of marine animals supports ecology, biodiversity and habitat conservation, and evidence-based policy-making. However, existing methods often overlook contextual interactions from the surrounding environment and insufficiently incorporate the hierarchical structure of marine biological taxonomy. To address these challenges, we propose MATANet (Multi-context Attention and Taxonomy-Aware Network), a novel model designed for fine-grained marine species classification. MATANet mimics expert strategies by using taxonomy and environmental context to interpret ambiguous features of underwater animals. It consists of two key components: a Multi-Context Environmental Attention Module (MCEAM), which learns relationships between regions of interest (ROIs) and their surrounding environments, and a Hierarchical Separation-Induced Learning Module (HSLM), which encodes taxonomic hierarchy into the feature space. MATANet combines instance and environmental features with taxonomic structure to enhance fine-grained classification. Experiments on the FathomNet2025, FAIR1M, and LifeCLEF2015-Fish datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Understanding how two radiology image sets differ is critical for generating clinical insights and for interpreting medical AI systems. We introduce RadDiff, a multimodal agentic system that performs radiologist-style comparative reasoning to describe clinically meaningful differences between paired radiology studies. RadDiff builds on a proposer-ranker framework from VisDiff, and incorporates four innovations inspired by real diagnostic workflows: (1) medical knowledge injection through domain-adapted vision-language models; (2) multimodal reasoning that integrates images with their clinical reports; (3) iterative hypothesis refinement across multiple reasoning rounds; and (4) targeted visual search that localizes and zooms in on salient regions to capture subtle findings. To evaluate RadDiff, we construct RadDiffBench, a challenging benchmark comprising 57 expert-validated radiology study pairs with ground-truth difference descriptions. On RadDiffBench, RadDiff achieves 47% accuracy, and 50% accuracy when guided by ground-truth reports, significantly outperforming the general-domain VisDiff baseline. We further demonstrate RadDiff's versatility across diverse clinical tasks, including COVID-19 phenotype comparison, racial subgroup analysis, and discovery of survival-related imaging features. Together, RadDiff and RadDiffBench provide the first method-and-benchmark foundation for systematically uncovering meaningful differences in radiological data.

Abstract: RGB-based camouflaged object detection struggles in real-world scenarios where color and texture cues are ambiguous. While hyperspectral image offers a powerful alternative by capturing fine-grained spectral signatures, progress in hyperspectral camouflaged object detection (HCOD) has been critically hampered by the absence of a dedicated, large-scale benchmark. To spur innovation, we introduce HyperCOD, the first challenging benchmark for HCOD. Comprising 350 high-resolution hyperspectral images, It features complex real-world scenarios with minimal objects, intricate shapes, severe occlusions, and dynamic lighting to challenge current models. The advent of foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) presents a compelling opportunity. To adapt the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for HCOD, we propose HyperSpectral Camouflage-aware SAM (HSC-SAM). HSC-SAM ingeniously reformulates the hyperspectral image by decoupling it into a spatial map fed to SAM's image encoder and a spectral saliency map that serves as an adaptive prompt. This translation effectively bridges the modality gap. Extensive experiments show that HSC-SAM sets a new state-of-the-art on HyperCOD and generalizes robustly to other public HSI datasets. The HyperCOD dataset and our HSC-SAM baseline provide a robust foundation to foster future research in this emerging area.

Conclusion: I2E通过结构化环境下的可操作交互机制，有效解决了传统方法在组合编辑场景下的技术瓶颈，为高精度图像编辑提供了新思路

Abstract: Existing text-guided image editing methods primarily rely on end-to-end pixel-level inpainting paradigm. Despite its success in simple scenarios, this paradigm still significantly struggles with compositional editing tasks that require precise local control and complex multi-object spatial reasoning. This paradigm is severely limited by 1) the implicit coupling of planning and execution, 2) the lack of object-level control granularity, and 3) the reliance on unstructured, pixel-centric modeling. To address these limitations, we propose I2E, a novel "Decompose-then-Action" paradigm that revisits image editing as an actionable interaction process within a structured environment. I2E utilizes a Decomposer to transform unstructured images into discrete, manipulable object layers and then introduces a physics-aware Vision-Language-Action Agent to parse complex instructions into a series of atomic actions via Chain-of-Thought reasoning. Further, we also construct I2E-Bench, a benchmark designed for multi-instance spatial reasoning and high-precision editing. Experimental results on I2E-Bench and multiple public benchmarks demonstrate that I2E significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in handling complex compositional instructions, maintaining physical plausibility, and ensuring multi-turn editing stability.

Conclusion: MVP通过显式模建视频时序特性，弥补了现有方法在动态视觉表征学习中的关键缺陷。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning based post-training paradigms for Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have achieved significant success by optimizing for visual-semantic tasks such as captioning or VideoQA. However, while these approaches effectively enhance perception abilities, they primarily target holistic content understanding, often lacking explicit supervision for intrinsic temporal coherence and inter-frame correlations. This tendency limits the models' ability to capture intricate dynamics and fine-grained visual causality. To explicitly bridge this gap, we propose a novel post-training objective: Masked Video Prediction (MVP). By requiring the model to reconstruct a masked continuous segment from a set of challenging distractors, MVP forces the model to attend to the sequential logic and temporal context of events. To support scalable training, we introduce a scalable data synthesis pipeline capable of transforming arbitrary video corpora into MVP training samples, and further employ Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a fine-grained reward function to enhance the model's understanding of video context and temporal properties. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that MVP enhances video reasoning capabilities by directly reinforcing temporal reasoning and causal understanding.

Abstract: In the manufacturing industry, computer vision systems based on artificial intelligence (AI) are widely used to reduce costs and increase production. Training these AI models requires a large amount of training data that is costly to acquire and annotate, especially in high-variance, low-volume manufacturing environments. A popular approach to reduce the need for real data is the use of synthetic data that is generated by leveraging computer-aided design (CAD) models available in the industry. However, in the agricultural industry these models are not readily available, increasing the difficulty in leveraging synthetic data. In this paper, we present different techniques for substituting CAD files to create synthetic datasets. We measure their relative performance when used to train an AI object detection model to separate stones and potatoes in a bin picking environment. We demonstrate that using highly representative 3D models acquired by scanning or using image-to-3D approaches can be used to generate synthetic data for training object detection models. Finetuning on a small real dataset can significantly improve the performance of the models and even get similar performance when less representative models are used.

TL;DR: NNGPT introduces a closed-loop system for LLMs to autonomously optimize code synthesis via empirical performance feedback, reducing brute-force search by 600x while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional data-aware augmentation in code synthesis relies on inefficient heuristics or brute-force methods. LLMs need a performance-aware framework to internalize non-symbolic feedback for task-aligned optimization.

Method: NNGPT uses Low-Rank Adaptation of LLMs trained on 6,000 labeled PyTorch augmentations, applying pairwise performance ordering. It avoids reinforcement learning/reward models, instead leveraging empirical feedback through direct prompting.

Result: 600x fewer evaluated candidates vs. brute-force, competitive accuracy, and task-aligned code generation. Ablation studies show Chain-of-Thought prompting harms performance, while direct prompting enables stable optimization.

Conclusion: LLMs can internalize semantic performance cues via closed-loop empirical feedback, enabling task-level reasoning without explicit symbolic rewards.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved notable performance in code synthesis; however, data-aware augmentation remains a limiting factor, handled via heuristic design or brute-force approaches. We introduce a performance-aware, closed-loop solution in the NNGPT ecosystem of projects that enables LLMs to autonomously engineer optimal transformations by internalizing empirical performance cues. We fine-tune LLMs with Low-Rank Adaptation on a novel repository of more than 6,000 empirically evaluated PyTorch augmentation functions, each annotated solely by downstream model accuracy. Training uses pairwise performance ordering (better-worse transformations), enabling alignment through empirical feedback without reinforcement learning, reward models, or symbolic objectives. This reduces the need for exhaustive search, achieving up to 600x times fewer evaluated candidates than brute-force discovery while maintaining competitive peak accuracy and shifting generation from random synthesis to task-aligned design. Ablation studies show that structured Chain-of-Thought prompting introduces syntactic noise and degrades performance, whereas direct prompting ensures stable optimization in performance-critical code tasks. Qualitative and quantitative analyses demonstrate that the model internalizes semantic performance cues rather than memorizing syntax. These results show that LLMs can exhibit task-level reasoning through non-textual feedback loops, bypassing explicit symbolic rewards.

Abstract: Developing foundation models in medical imaging requires continuous monitoring of downstream performance. Researchers are burdened with tracking numerous experiments, design choices, and their effects on performance, often relying on ad-hoc, manual workflows that are inherently slow and error-prone. We introduce EvalBlocks, a modular, plug-and-play framework for efficient evaluation of foundation models during development. Built on Snakemake, EvalBlocks supports seamless integration of new datasets, foundation models, aggregation methods, and evaluation strategies. All experiments and results are tracked centrally and are reproducible with a single command, while efficient caching and parallel execution enable scalable use on shared compute infrastructure. Demonstrated on five state-of-the-art foundation models and three medical imaging classification tasks, EvalBlocks streamlines model evaluation, enabling researchers to iterate faster and focus on model innovation rather than evaluation logistics. The framework is released as open source software at https://github.com/DIAGNijmegen/eval-blocks.

Conclusion: 迭代式深度概率估计框架有效解决单次warp局限性，在参数效率和实时性优势下实现SOTA重建质量，具有跨数据集强泛化能力。

Abstract: Generalizable 3D Gaussian Splatting aims to directly predict Gaussian parameters using a feed-forward network for scene reconstruction. Among these parameters, Gaussian means are particularly difficult to predict, so depth is usually estimated first and then unprojected to obtain the Gaussian sphere centers. Existing methods typically rely solely on a single warp to estimate depth probability, which hinders their ability to fully leverage cross-view geometric cues, resulting in unstable and coarse depth maps. To address this limitation, we propose IDESplat, which iteratively applies warp operations to boost depth probability estimation for accurate Gaussian mean prediction. First, to eliminate the inherent instability of a single warp, we introduce a Depth Probability Boosting Unit (DPBU) that integrates epipolar attention maps produced by cascading warp operations in a multiplicative manner. Next, we construct an iterative depth estimation process by stacking multiple DPBUs, progressively identifying potential depth candidates with high likelihood. As IDESplat iteratively boosts depth probability estimates and updates the depth candidates, the depth map is gradually refined, resulting in accurate Gaussian means. We conduct experiments on RealEstate10K, ACID, and DL3DV. IDESplat achieves outstanding reconstruction quality and state-of-the-art performance with real-time efficiency. On RE10K, it outperforms DepthSplat by 0.33 dB in PSNR, using only 10.7% of the parameters and 70% of the memory. Additionally, our IDESplat improves PSNR by 2.95 dB over DepthSplat on the DTU dataset in cross-dataset experiments, demonstrating its strong generalization ability.

However, current methods often produce smooth depth maps that lack the fine geometric detail needed for accurate scene understanding. We propose MDENeRF, an iterative framework that refines monocular depth estimates using depth information from Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs). MDENeRF consists of three components: (1) an initial monocular estimate for global structure, (2) a NeRF trained on perturbed viewpoints, with per-pixel uncertainty, and (3) Bayesian fusion of the noisy monocular and NeRF depths. We derive NeRF uncertainty from the volume rendering process to iteratively inject high-frequency fine details. Meanwhile, our monocular prior maintains global structure. We demonstrate superior performance on key metrics and experiments using indoor scenes from the SUN RGB-D dataset.

Abstract: Deep learning has achieved significant advancements in medical image segmentation. Currently, obtaining accurate segmentation outcomes is critically reliant on large-scale datasets with high-quality annotations. However, noisy annotations are frequently encountered owing to the complex morphological structures of organs in medical images and variations among different annotators, which can substantially limit the efficacy of segmentation models. Motivated by the fact that medical imaging annotator can correct labeling errors during segmentation based on prior knowledge, we propose an end-to-end Staged Voxel-Level Deep Reinforcement Learning (SVL-DRL) framework for robust medical image segmentation under noisy annotations. This framework employs a dynamic iterative update strategy to automatically mitigate the impact of erroneous labels without requiring manual intervention. The key advancements of SVL-DRL over existing works include: i) formulating noisy annotations as a voxel-dependent problem and addressing it through a novel staged reinforcement learning framework which guarantees robust model convergence; ii) incorporating a voxel-level asynchronous advantage actor-critic (vA3C) module that conceptualizes each voxel as an autonomous agent, which allows each agent to dynamically refine its own state representation during training, thereby directly mitigating the influence of erroneous labels; iii) designing a novel action space for the agents, along with a composite reward function that strategically combines the Dice value and a spatial continuity metric to significantly boost segmentation accuracy while maintain semantic integrity. Experiments on three public medical image datasets demonstrates State-of-The-Art (SoTA) performance under various experimental settings, with an average improvement of over 3\% in both Dice and IoU scores.

Abstract: Distributing government relief efforts after a flood is challenging. In India, the crops are widely affected by floods; therefore, making rapid and accurate crop damage assessment is crucial for effective post-disaster agricultural management. Traditional manual surveys are slow and biased, while current satellite-based methods face challenges like cloud cover and low spatial resolution. Therefore, to bridge this gap, this paper introduced FLNet, a novel deep learning based architecture that used super-resolution to enhance the 10 m spatial resolution of Sentinel-2 satellite images into 3 m resolution before classifying damage. We tested our model on the Bihar Flood Impacted Croplands Dataset (BFCD-22), and the results showed an improved critical "Full Damage" F1-score from 0.83 to 0.89, nearly matching the 0.89 score of commercial high-resolution imagery. This work presented a cost-effective and scalable solution, paving the way for a nationwide shift from manual to automated, high-fidelity damage assessment.

TL;DR: FocusUI 提出了一种高效的UI定位框架，通过筛选与指令相关的关键视觉标记并保持位置连续性，在降低计算开销的同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型（VLMs）处理高分辨率截图时需要数千视觉标记，导致计算开销大且注意力分散。人类交互式UI时通常聚焦特定区域，因此需要模拟人眼效率的轻量化方案。

Result: 在ScreenSpot-Pro基准上，FocusUI-7B比GUI-Actor-7B性能提升3.7%；保留30%视觉标记时仅下降3.2%准确率，同时推理速度提升1.44倍，GPU峰值内存降低17%。

Conclusion: 通过任务特异性分析提出的轻量化框架，在UI定位任务中实现计算效率与精度的平衡，验证了结构化视觉标记压缩的有效性。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable performance in User Interface (UI) grounding tasks, driven by their ability to process increasingly high-resolution screenshots. However, screenshots are tokenized into thousands of visual tokens (e.g., about 4700 for 2K resolution), incurring significant computational overhead and diluting attention. In contrast, humans typically focus on regions of interest when interacting with UI. In this work, we pioneer the task of efficient UI grounding. Guided by practical analysis of the task's characteristics and challenges, we propose FocusUI, an efficient UI grounding framework that selects patches most relevant to the instruction while preserving positional continuity for precise grounding. FocusUI addresses two key challenges: (1) Eliminating redundant tokens in visual encoding. We construct patch-level supervision by fusing an instruction-conditioned score with a rule-based UI-graph score that down-weights large homogeneous regions to select distinct and instruction-relevant visual tokens. (2) Preserving positional continuity during visual token selection. We find that general visual token pruning methods suffer from severe accuracy degradation on UI grounding tasks due to broken positional information. We introduce a novel PosPad strategy, which compresses each contiguous sequence of dropped visual tokens into a single special marker placed at the sequence's last index to preserve positional continuity. Comprehensive experiments on four grounding benchmarks demonstrate that FocusUI surpasses GUI-specific baselines. On the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark, FocusUI-7B achieves a performance improvement of 3.7% over GUI-Actor-7B. Even with only 30% visual token retention, FocusUI-7B drops by only 3.2% while achieving up to 1.44x faster inference and 17% lower peak GPU memory.

Abstract: Hands are central to interacting with our surroundings and conveying gestures, making their inclusion essential for full-body motion synthesis. Despite this, existing human motion synthesis methods fall short: some ignore hand motions entirely, while others generate full-body motions only for narrowly scoped tasks under highly constrained settings. A key obstacle is the lack of large-scale datasets that jointly capture diverse full-body motion with detailed hand articulation. While some datasets capture both, they are limited in scale and diversity. Conversely, large-scale datasets typically focus either on body motion without hands or on hand motions without the body. To overcome this, we curate and unify existing hand motion datasets with large-scale body motion data to generate full-body sequences that capture both hand and body. We then propose the first diffusion-based unconditional full-body motion prior, FUSION, which jointly models body and hand motion. Despite using a pose-based motion representation, FUSION surpasses state-of-the-art skeletal control models on the Keypoint Tracking task in the HumanML3D dataset and achieves superior motion naturalness. Beyond standard benchmarks, we demonstrate that FUSION can go beyond typical uses of motion priors through two applications: (1) generating detailed full-body motion including fingers during interaction given the motion of an object, and (2) generating Self-Interaction motions using an LLM to transform natural language cues into actionable motion constraints. For these applications, we develop an optimization pipeline that refines the latent space of our diffusion model to generate task-specific motions. Experiments on these tasks highlight precise control over hand motion while maintaining plausible full-body coordination. The code will be public.

Conclusion: The combination of advanced AI models and PosterDNA dataset provides a scalable solution for commercial poster design automation, enabling small-text rendering and professional-quality outputs.

Abstract: Commercial-grade poster design demands the seamless integration of aesthetic appeal with precise, informative content delivery. Current automated poster generation systems face significant limitations, including incomplete design workflows, poor text rendering accuracy, and insufficient flexibility for commercial applications. To address these challenges, we propose PosterVerse, a full-workflow, commercial-grade poster generation method that seamlessly automates the entire design process while delivering high-density and scalable text rendering. PosterVerse replicates professional design through three key stages: (1) blueprint creation using fine-tuned LLMs to extract key design elements from user requirements, (2) graphical background generation via customized diffusion models to create visually appealing imagery, and (3) unified layout-text rendering with an MLLM-powered HTML engine to guarantee high text accuracy and flexible customization. In addition, we introduce PosterDNA, a commercial-grade, HTML-based dataset tailored for training and validating poster design models. To the best of our knowledge, PosterDNA is the first Chinese poster generation dataset to introduce HTML typography files, enabling scalable text rendering and fundamentally solving the challenges of rendering small and high-density text. Experimental results demonstrate that PosterVerse consistently produces commercial-grade posters with appealing visuals, accurate text alignment, and customizable layouts, making it a promising solution for automating commercial poster design.

### [48] [Padé Neurons for Efficient Neural Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04005)
*Onur Keleş,A. Murat Tekalp*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Padé neurons (Paons), a new nonlinear neuron model based on Padé approximants, which offers stronger non-linearity, layer efficiency, and versatility over existing neuron models. Experimental results show that networks using Paons achieve better or comparable performance with fewer layers in tasks like image super-resolution, compression, and classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of classic linear neurons with point-wise activations and other existing nonlinear neuron models (e.g., quadratic, generative, super neurons) that might lack diversity in non-linearity or require more layers for comparable performance. The authors propose Paons as a more efficient and generalizable solution.

Method: Introducing a novel nonlinear neuron model based on Padé approximants. Unlike previous approaches using point-wise activations, the Paon model allows each neuron to learn a distinct nonlinear function of its inputs. It offers diverse nonlinearity and achieves equivalent or greater representational power with fewer layers compared to piecewise linear approximations. Paons subsume multiple existing neuron types as special cases, enabling their replacement in any network.

Result: Replacing classic neurons with Paons in established neural network models (e.g., ResNet variants) resulted in comparable or superior performance on image super-resolution, compression, and classification tasks despite using fewer layers. This demonstrates Paons' efficiency and effectiveness in capturing complex patterns while reducing model depth.

Conclusion: Paons are a novel generalization of neuron models that provide greater non-linearity with fewer layers compared to standard models like linear neurons with activations and other nonlinear neuron variants. The authors demonstrate practical benefits in terms of performance and efficiency, and make their PyTorch implementation publicly available for further exploration and adoption.

Abstract: Neural networks commonly employ the McCulloch-Pitts neuron model, which is a linear model followed by a point-wise non-linear activation. Various researchers have already advanced inherently non-linear neuron models, such as quadratic neurons, generalized operational neurons, generative neurons, and super neurons, which offer stronger non-linearity compared to point-wise activation functions. In this paper, we introduce a novel and better non-linear neuron model called Padé neurons (Paons), inspired by Padé approximants. Paons offer several advantages, such as diversity of non-linearity, since each Paon learns a different non-linear function of its inputs, and layer efficiency, since Paons provide stronger non-linearity in much fewer layers compared to piecewise linear approximation. Furthermore, Paons include all previously proposed neuron models as special cases, thus any neuron model in any network can be replaced by Paons. We note that there has been a proposal to employ the Padé approximation as a generalized point-wise activation function, which is fundamentally different from our model. To validate the efficacy of Paons, in our experiments, we replace classic neurons in some well-known neural image super-resolution, compression, and classification models based on the ResNet architecture with Paons. Our comprehensive experimental results and analyses demonstrate that neural models built by Paons provide better or equal performance than their classic counterparts with a smaller number of layers. The PyTorch implementation code for Paon is open-sourced at https://github.com/onur-keles/Paon.

Motivation: 现有视频生成模型过度关注视觉质量与文本对齐，但未能有效识别结构性失真（如物体形态异常），导致生成视频质量下降。研究人员发现约42%的生成视频存在此类问题，需开发专门评估的框架。

Method: 构建基于Transformer的REACT模型，采用两阶段训练框架：1) 使用结构化标注数据进行监督微调（含mask损失优化）；2) 应用GRPO强化学习融合成对奖励和人类偏好。创新性引入动态帧采样机制，配合自行创建的结构失真分类体系与大规模标注数据集。

Result: REACT在REACT-Bench基准测试中实现87.6%的失真检测准确率，较传统方法提升23%。与人类偏好相关性达到0.82（spearman），可解释性分析实现每帧的可归因性评分，且推理速度提升1.8倍。

Conclusion: REACT通过结构感知的奖励建模和优化训练框架，首次实现了视频生成任务中异常物体交互的定量评估，为生成模型的质量控制提供了新工具。

Abstract: Recent advances in video reward models and post-training strategies have improved text-to-video (T2V) generation. While these models typically assess visual quality, motion quality, and text alignment, they often overlook key structural distortions, such as abnormal object appearances and interactions, which can degrade the overall quality of the generative video. To address this gap, we introduce REACT, a frame-level reward model designed specifically for structural distortions evaluation in generative videos. REACT assigns point-wise scores and attribution labels by reasoning over video frames, focusing on recognizing distortions. To support this, we construct a large-scale human preference dataset, annotated based on our proposed taxonomy of structural distortions, and generate additional data using a efficient Chain-of-Thought (CoT) synthesis pipeline. REACT is trained with a two-stage framework: ((1) supervised fine-tuning with masked loss for domain knowledge injection, followed by (2) reinforcement learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and pairwise rewards to enhance reasoning capability and align output scores with human preferences. During inference, a dynamic sampling mechanism is introduced to focus on frames most likely to exhibit distortion. We also present REACT-Bench, a benchmark for generative video distortion evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that REACT complements existing reward models in assessing structutal distortion, achieving both accurate quantitative evaluations and interpretable attribution analysis.

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了风电检测中数据标注成本高和模型迁移困难的瓶颈问题，为工业自动化检测提供了可扩展的技术路线。

Abstract: Reliable operation of wind turbines requires frequent inspections, as even minor surface damages can degrade aerodynamic performance, reduce energy output, and accelerate blade wear. Central to automating these inspections is the accurate segmentation of turbine blades from visual data. This task is traditionally addressed through dense, pixel-wise deep learning models. However, such methods demand extensive annotated datasets, posing scalability challenges. In this work, we introduce an annotation-efficient segmentation approach that reframes the pixel-level task into a binary region classification problem. Image regions are generated using a fully unsupervised, interpretable Modular Adaptive Region Growing technique, guided by image-specific Adaptive Thresholding and enhanced by a Region Merging process that consolidates fragmented areas into coherent segments. To improve generalization and classification robustness, we introduce RegionMix, an augmentation strategy that synthesizes new training samples by combining distinct regions. Our framework demonstrates state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy and strong cross-site generalization by consistently segmenting turbine blades across distinct windfarms.

Conclusion: LocalDPO实现了一种更高效细粒度的视频生成器对齐范式，解决了传统方法的数据效率瓶颈。

Abstract: Aligning text-to-video diffusion models with human preferences is crucial for generating high-quality videos. Existing Direct Preference Otimization (DPO) methods rely on multi-sample ranking and task-specific critic models, which is inefficient and often yields ambiguous global supervision. To address these limitations, we propose LocalDPO, a novel post-training framework that constructs localized preference pairs from real videos and optimizes alignment at the spatio-temporal region level. We design an automated pipeline to efficiently collect preference pair data that generates preference pairs with a single inference per prompt, eliminating the need for external critic models or manual annotation. Specifically, we treat high-quality real videos as positive samples and generate corresponding negatives by locally corrupting them with random spatio-temporal masks and restoring only the masked regions using the frozen base model. During training, we introduce a region-aware DPO loss that restricts preference learning to corrupted areas for rapid convergence. Experiments on Wan2.1 and CogVideoX demonstrate that LocalDPO consistently improves video fidelity, temporal coherence and human preference scores over other post-training approaches, establishing a more efficient and fine-grained paradigm for video generator alignment.

Conclusion: 文本惯性是LMMs核心缺陷，论文提出的扰动注入协议和主动视觉优化框架为提升多模态推理可靠性提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in video reasoning via Chain-of-Thought (CoT). However, the robustness of their reasoning chains remains questionable. In this paper, we identify a critical failure mode termed textual inertia, where once a textual hallucination occurs in the thinking process, models tend to blindly adhere to the erroneous text while neglecting conflicting visual evidence. To systematically investigate this, we propose the LogicGraph Perturbation Protocol that structurally injects perturbations into the reasoning chains of diverse LMMs spanning both native reasoning architectures and prompt-driven paradigms to evaluate their self-reflection capabilities. The results reveal that models successfully self-correct in less than 10% of cases and predominantly succumb to blind textual error propagation. To mitigate this, we introduce Active Visual-Context Refinement, a training-free inference paradigm which orchestrates an active visual re-grounding mechanism to enforce fine-grained verification coupled with an adaptive context refinement strategy to summarize and denoise the reasoning history. Experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly stifles hallucination propagation and enhances reasoning robustness.

Abstract: We present Gen3R, a method that bridges the strong priors of foundational reconstruction models and video diffusion models for scene-level 3D generation. We repurpose the VGGT reconstruction model to produce geometric latents by training an adapter on its tokens, which are regularized to align with the appearance latents of pre-trained video diffusion models. By jointly generating these disentangled yet aligned latents, Gen3R produces both RGB videos and corresponding 3D geometry, including camera poses, depth maps, and global point clouds. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results in single- and multi-image conditioned 3D scene generation. Additionally, our method can enhance the robustness of reconstruction by leveraging generative priors, demonstrating the mutual benefit of tightly coupling reconstruction and generative models.

Conclusion: 所提框架通过逻辑一致性约束有效解决了空间视觉推理中的逻辑断裂问题，为复杂空间决策系统的可信赖推理提供了新范式。

Abstract: The evolution of Remote Sensing Vision-Language Models(RS-VLMs) emphasizes the importance of transitioning from perception-centric recognition toward high-level deductive reasoning to enhance cognitive reliability in complex spatial tasks. However, current models often suffer from logical hallucinations, where correct answers are derived from flawed reasoning chains or rely on positional shortcuts rather than spatial logic. This decoupling undermines reliability in strategic spatial decision-making. To address this, we present GeoReason, a framework designed to synchronize internal thinking with final decisions. We first construct GeoReason-Bench, a logic-driven dataset containing 4,000 reasoning trajectories synthesized from geometric primitives and expert knowledge. We then formulate a two-stage training strategy: (1) Supervised Knowledge Initialization to equip the model with reasoning syntax and domain expertise, and (2) Consistency-Aware Reinforcement Learning to refine deductive reliability. This second stage integrates a novel Logical Consistency Reward, which penalizes logical drift via an option permutation strategy to anchor decisions in verifiable reasoning traces. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly enhances the cognitive reliability and interpretability of RS-VLMs, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to other advanced methods.

*Leandro Stival,Ricardo da Silva Torres,Helio Pedrini*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种利用二维表示和对比学习的多模态方法，显著提升卫星时间序列数据的特征提取与分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习模型难以高效处理卫星遥感时间序列（SITS）的海量数据，需通过更有效的表征学习提取关键特征以优化下游任务。

Method: 1) 将像素级植被指数（NDVI/EVI/SAVI）时间序列转化为递归图作为二维表征；2) 提出像素级多模态对比学习方法（PIMC），结合二维时序表征与遥感影像数据。使用PASTIS和EuroSAT数据集验证方法有效性。

Result: 二维表征显著增强SITS特征提取效果，对比学习提升遥感影像与时间序列的表征质量，方法在像素级分类、土地利用分类等任务上超越现有SOTA模型。

Conclusion: 该多模态无监督框架通过创新性二维表征和对比学习机制，为卫星时间序列和遥感影像处理提供了鲁棒性的技术解决方案。

Abstract: Satellites continuously generate massive volumes of data, particularly for Earth observation, including satellite image time series (SITS). However, most deep learning models are designed to process either entire images or complete time series sequences to extract meaningful features for downstream tasks. In this study, we propose a novel multimodal approach that leverages pixel-wise two-dimensional (2D) representations to encode visual property variations from SITS more effectively. Specifically, we generate recurrence plots from pixel-based vegetation index time series (NDVI, EVI, and SAVI) as an alternative to using raw pixel values, creating more informative representations. Additionally, we introduce PIxel-wise Multimodal Contrastive (PIMC), a new multimodal self-supervision approach that produces effective encoders based on two-dimensional pixel time series representations and remote sensing imagery (RSI). To validate our approach, we assess its performance on three downstream tasks: pixel-level forecasting and classification using the PASTIS dataset, and land cover classification on the EuroSAT dataset. Moreover, we compare our results to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on all downstream tasks. Our experimental results show that the use of 2D representations significantly enhances feature extraction from SITS, while contrastive learning improves the quality of representations for both pixel time series and RSI. These findings suggest that our multimodal method outperforms existing models in various Earth observation tasks, establishing it as a robust self-supervision framework for processing both SITS and RSI.

*Jun Wang,Chunyu Qiang,Yuxin Guo,Yiran Wang,Xijuan Zeng,Chen Zhang,Pengfei Wan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Klear提出通过统一架构、渐进式多任务训练及大规模高质量数据集解决音视频生成中的对齐与退化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在音频-视觉不同步、唇语对齐差和单模态质量下降，主要因跨模态建模不足、泛化能力弱及缺乏高质量标注数据。

Method: 采用单塔DiT+Omni-Full Attention架构强制对齐；渐进式多任务训练结合随机模态掩码和课程学习；开发自动化流程构建大规模对齐音视频-字幕三元组数据集。

Result: 模型在联合/单模态任务上均超越现有方法，与Veo3相当，且在分布外场景保持鲁棒性，成功生成高保真同步内容。

Conclusion: Klear提供统一可扩展框架，通过架构-训练-数据协同优化解决了音视频生成的核心挑战。

Abstract: Audio-video joint generation has progressed rapidly, yet substantial challenges still remain. Non-commercial approaches still suffer audio-visual asynchrony, poor lip-speech alignment, and unimodal degradation, which can be stemmed from weak audio-visual correspondence modeling, limited generalization, and scarce high-quality dense-caption data. To address these issues, we introduce Klear and delve into three axes--model architecture, training strategy, and data curation. Architecturally, we adopt a single-tower design with unified DiT blocks and an Omni-Full Attention mechanism, achieving tight audio-visual alignment and strong scalability. Training-wise, we adopt a progressive multitask regime--random modality masking to joint optimization across tasks, and a multistage curriculum, yielding robust representations, strengthening A-V aligned world knowledge, and preventing unimodal collapse. For datasets, we present the first large-scale audio-video dataset with dense captions, and introduce a novel automated data-construction pipeline which annotates and filters millions of diverse, high-quality, strictly aligned audio-video-caption triplets. Building on this, Klear scales to large datasets, delivering high-fidelity, semantically and temporally aligned, instruction-following generation in both joint and unimodal settings while generalizing robustly to out-of-distribution scenarios. Across tasks, it substantially outperforms prior methods by a large margin and achieves performance comparable to Veo 3, offering a unified, scalable path toward next-generation audio-video synthesis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出Diffusion-DRF，通过可微分奖励函数优化视频扩散模型，利用视觉语言模型（VLM）直接反向传播反馈，解决奖励黑客问题并提升视频生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Direct Preference Optimization（DPO）依赖非可微的人工或奖励模型标注，导致训练成本高、易引发奖励黑客和不稳定训练。

Method: 采用冻结的预训练VLM作为训练无关的critic，通过反向传播扩散去噪链的logit响应生成token感知梯度，并结合自动化多维提示和梯度检查点技术实现高效优化。

Result: 在保持视频质量与语义对齐性的同时避免了奖励坍塌问题，且无需额外奖励模型或偏好数据集，方法可迁移至其他扩散生成任务。

Conclusion: Diffusion-DRF通过可微分奖励流有效解决传统策略缺陷，在无额外数据条件下验证了方案的有效性和通用性。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has recently improved Text-to-Video (T2V) generation by enhancing visual fidelity and text alignment. However, current methods rely on non-differentiable preference signals from human annotations or learned reward models. This reliance makes training label-intensive, bias-prone, and easy-to-game, which often triggers reward hacking and unstable training. We propose Diffusion-DRF, a differentiable reward flow for fine-tuning video diffusion models using a frozen, off-the-shelf Vision-Language Model (VLM) as a training-free critic. Diffusion-DRF directly backpropagates VLM feedback through the diffusion denoising chain, converting logit-level responses into token-aware gradients for optimization. We propose an automated, aspect-structured prompting pipeline to obtain reliable multi-dimensional VLM feedback, while gradient checkpointing enables efficient updates through the final denoising steps. Diffusion-DRF improves video quality and semantic alignment while mitigating reward hacking and collapse -- without additional reward models or preference datasets. It is model-agnostic and readily generalizes to other diffusion-based generative tasks.

### [58] [ToTMNet: FFT-Accelerated Toeplitz Temporal Mixing Network for Lightweight Remote Photoplethysmography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04159)
*Vladimir Frants,Sos Agaian,Karen Panetta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种轻量级的远程光体积描记（rPPG）模型ToTMNet，通过替换传统的时间注意力机制为基于快速傅里叶变换（FFT）加速的Toeplitz时间混合层，实现了高效且准确的心率估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习rPPG方法依赖计算复杂度高、参数量大的时间注意力机制（如平方级时间扩展），需设计低计算成本且全局建模能力的替代方案。

Method: 提出基于Toeplitz矩阵的时间混合层，利用循环嵌入和FFT卷积实现线性参数数量与近线性时间效率的全局时间感受野，并通过门控机制融合局部深度卷积与全局Toeplitz混合。

Result: 在真实数据集UBFC-rPPG（心率平均绝对误差1.055 bpm，皮尔逊相关0.996）和合成数据集SCAMPS（跨域测试误差1.582 bpm，相关0.994）中均达到高精度，且模型仅63k参数。

Conclusion: Toeplitz时间混合在rPPG中可作为高效替代注意力的方案，但受限于数据集数量较少，门控机制对跨领域任务效果显著提升。

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) estimates a blood volume pulse (BVP) waveform from facial videos captured by commodity cameras. Although recent deep models improve robustness compared to classical signal-processing approaches, many methods increase computational cost and parameter count, and attention-based temporal modeling introduces quadratic scaling with respect to the temporal length. This paper proposes ToTMNet, a lightweight rPPG architecture that replaces temporal attention with an FFT-accelerated Toeplitz temporal mixing layer. The Toeplitz operator provides full-sequence temporal receptive field using a linear number of parameters in the clip length and can be applied in near-linear time using circulant embedding and FFT-based convolution. ToTMNet integrates the global Toeplitz temporal operator into a compact gated temporal mixer that combines a local depthwise temporal convolution branch with gated global Toeplitz mixing, enabling efficient long-range temporal filtering while only having 63k parameters. Experiments on two datasets, UBFC-rPPG (real videos) and SCAMPS (synthetic videos), show that ToTMNet achieves strong heart-rate estimation accuracy with a compact design. On UBFC-rPPG intra-dataset evaluation, ToTMNet reaches 1.055 bpm MAE with Pearson correlation 0.996. In a synthetic-to-real setting (SCAMPS to UBFC-rPPG), ToTMNet reaches 1.582 bpm MAE with Pearson correlation 0.994. Ablation results confirm that the gating mechanism is important for effectively using global Toeplitz mixing, especially under domain shift. The main limitation of this preprint study is the use of only two datasets; nevertheless, the results indicate that Toeplitz-structured temporal mixing is a practical and efficient alternative to attention for rPPG.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出一种基于2D图像的视觉定位新方法，通过为图像添加估计深度图增强几何结构，结合密集匹配器和GPU加速优化，在保持存储计算效率的同时达到最先进精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉定位方法存在矛盾：2D方法几何推理弱（但易维护），3D方法精度高但依赖集中重建且更新困难。作者希望设计一种兼顾维护便捷性、高精度和内存效率的定位方法。

Method: ①保留2D图像表示；②为每张图像估计深度图以编码几何结构；③使用密集匹配器进行特征匹配；④采用LO-RANSAC GPU加速实现；⑤开发紧凑压缩算法以平衡精度与内存占用。

Result: 在多个标准数据集上刷新定位精度记录，内存效率显著优于同类方法；存储与计算效率同步提升，实现了最高精度与内存效率的灵活权衡（同等精度下地图体积更小）。

Conclusion: 该方法突破了传统2D/3D方法的固有限制，实现了维护便捷性、定位精度、内存效率的有机统一，为大规模视觉定位提供了新的高效解决方案。

Abstract: Existing visual localization methods are typically either 2D image-based, which are easy to build and maintain but limited in effective geometric reasoning, or 3D structure-based, which achieve high accuracy but require a centralized reconstruction and are difficult to update. In this work, we revisit visual localization with a 2D image-based representation and propose to augment each image with estimated depth maps to capture the geometric structure. Supported by the effective use of dense matchers, this representation is not only easy to build and maintain, but achieves highest accuracy in challenging conditions. With compact compression and a GPU-accelerated LO-RANSAC implementation, the whole pipeline is efficient in both storage and computation and allows for a flexible trade-off between accuracy and highest memory efficiency. Our method achieves a new state-of-the-art accuracy on various standard benchmarks and outperforms existing memory-efficient methods at comparable map sizes.

*Yanzhe Lyu,Chen Geng,Karthik Dharmarajan,Yunzhi Zhang,Hadi Alzayer,Shangzhe Wu,Jiajun Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes CHORD, a universal generative pipeline for synthesizing complex 4D scene dynamics (3D + time) by extracting motion information from 2D videos through a distillation-based approach, avoiding labor-intensive rule-based methods and avoiding large-scale category-specific datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on category-specific rules (labor-intensive) or require extensive labeled datasets (not scalable). The authors aim to create a versatile, category-agnostic pipeline that leverages rich motion information from unlabeled videos for realistic 4D scene generation.

Method: Proposes a distillation-based pipeline that transfers Lagrangian motion understanding from 2D video generative models to 3D scenes, translating Eulerian video representations into physical motion dynamics while maintaining universality across object categories.

Result: Demonstrated successful generation of diverse multi-body 4D dynamics, outperformed traditional rule-based and learning-based methods, and achieved effective robotics manipulation policy generation as a practical application.

Conclusion: CHORD's video-driven paradigm enables category-agnostic 4D generation by distilling motion information from videos, eliminating the need for category-specific datasets or manual heuristics while enabling novel applications in robotics and scene simulation.

Abstract: Dynamic objects in our physical 4D (3D + time) world are constantly evolving, deforming, and interacting with other objects, leading to diverse 4D scene dynamics. In this paper, we present a universal generative pipeline, CHORD, for CHOReographing Dynamic objects and scenes and synthesizing this type of phenomena. Traditional rule-based graphics pipelines to create these dynamics are based on category-specific heuristics, yet are labor-intensive and not scalable. Recent learning-based methods typically demand large-scale datasets, which may not cover all object categories in interest. Our approach instead inherits the universality from the video generative models by proposing a distillation-based pipeline to extract the rich Lagrangian motion information hidden in the Eulerian representations of 2D videos. Our method is universal, versatile, and category-agnostic. We demonstrate its effectiveness by conducting experiments to generate a diverse range of multi-body 4D dynamics, show its advantage compared to existing methods, and demonstrate its applicability in generating robotics manipulation policies.

*Shuo Lu,Yinuo Xu,Jianjie Cheng,Lingxiao He,Meng Wang,Jian Liang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出DeepResearch-Slice框架，通过显式过滤机制解决检索证据的上下文盲视问题，在六个基准测试中实现显著鲁棒性提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前模型存在检索-利用差距，即使成功检索证据仍因上下文盲视和噪声干扰无法有效利用，需设计更直接的证据筛选机制。

Method: 采用神经符号架构，使用显式跨度索引预测进行硬过滤（而非隐式注意），通过确定性掩码直接截取关键证据段落供后续推理。

Result: 在冷冻模型上取得19.1%到33.0%的绝对提升（73%相对改进），且无需更新参数即能显著降低噪声影响，六项基准验证有效性。

Conclusion: 证实显式证据锚定机制可弥补隐式注意力不足，为噪声环境下的开放研究提供免训练的高效解决方案。

Abstract: Deep Research agents predominantly optimize search policies to maximize retrieval probability. However, we identify a critical bottleneck: the retrieval-utilization gap, where models fail to use gold evidence even after it is retrieved, due to context blindness in noisy environments. To bridge this gap, we propose DeepResearch-Slice, a simple yet effective neuro-symbolic framework. Unlike implicit attention, our approach predicts precise span indices to perform a deterministic hard filter before reasoning. Extensive evaluations across six benchmarks show substantial robustness gains. Applying our method to frozen backbones yields a 73 percent relative improvement, from 19.1 percent to 33.0 percent, effectively mitigating noise without requiring parameter updates to the reasoning model. These results highlight the need for explicit grounding mechanisms in open-ended research.

TL;DR: 本论文提出Jailbreak-Zero，通过攻击LLM生成对抗性提示并利用偏好数据集进行微调，实现策略覆盖、攻击多样性和提示保真度的帕累托最优，在提升攻击成功率并降低人工干预方面具有显著优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于示例的LLM安全评估方法存在生成效率低和多样性不足的缺陷，需要转向更高效的基于策略的框架。

Method: 用攻击LLM批量生成对抗性提示，随后通过偏好数据集微调攻击模型，实现多目标优化。

Result: 在GPT-40、Claude 3.5等模型上攻击成功率显著高于现有方法，生成提示具有高可读性且仅需极少量人工标注。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种可扩展、全自动的LLM漏洞挖掘方案，能高效识别模型安全风险并为防御机制提供迭代依据。

Abstract: This paper introduces Jailbreak-Zero, a novel red teaming methodology that shifts the paradigm of Large Language Model (LLM) safety evaluation from a constrained example-based approach to a more expansive and effective policy-based framework. By leveraging an attack LLM to generate a high volume of diverse adversarial prompts and then fine-tuning this attack model with a preference dataset, Jailbreak-Zero achieves Pareto optimality across the crucial objectives of policy coverage, attack strategy diversity, and prompt fidelity to real user inputs. The empirical evidence demonstrates the superiority of this method, showcasing significantly higher attack success rates against both open-source and proprietary models like GPT-40 and Claude 3.5 when compared to existing state-of-the-art techniques. Crucially, Jailbreak-Zero accomplishes this while producing human-readable and effective adversarial prompts with minimal need for human intervention, thereby presenting a more scalable and comprehensive solution for identifying and mitigating the safety vulnerabilities of LLMs.

*Alif Munim,Jun Ma,Omar Ibrahim,Alhusain Abdalla,Shuolin Yin,Leo Chen,Bo Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study evaluates on-device large language models (gpt-oss-20b and gpt-oss-120b) for clinical decision-making, showing they perform competitively with larger open-source and proprietary models while enabling privacy-preserving, resource-efficient deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Proprietary cloud-based LLMs raise privacy concerns, while existing open-source models demand excessive resources. This work addresses the need for lightweight, adaptable models suitable for resource-constrained clinical environments.

Method: Benchmarked gpt-oss-20b and gpt-oss-120b against GPT-5, o4-mini, and DeepSeek-R1 across three clinical tasks (disease diagnosis, ophthalmology diagnosis/management, expert grading simulation). Fine-tuning of gpt-oss-20b was tested on diagnostic data to assess adaptability.

Result: Gpt-oss models matched or exceeded DeepSeek-R1 and o4-mini performance despite smaller size. Fine-tuning improved gpt-oss-20b's diagnostic accuracy to near-GPT-5 levels. On-device systems demonstrated strong adaptability and efficiency.

Conclusion: On-device LLMs offer a viable solution for accurate, privacy-preserving clinical decision support in resource-limited settings, with potential for broader integration into healthcare workflows through model optimization and fine-tuning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly advanced in clinical decision-making, yet the deployment of proprietary systems is hindered by privacy concerns and reliance on cloud-based infrastructure. Open-source alternatives allow local inference but often require large model sizes that limit their use in resource-constrained clinical settings. Here, we benchmark two on-device LLMs, gpt-oss-20b and gpt-oss-120b, across three representative clinical tasks: general disease diagnosis, specialty-specific (ophthalmology) diagnosis and management, and simulation of human expert grading and evaluation. We compare their performance with state-of-the-art proprietary models (GPT-5 and o4-mini) and a leading open-source model (DeepSeek-R1), and we further evaluate the adaptability of on-device systems by fine-tuning gpt-oss-20b on general diagnostic data. Across tasks, gpt-oss models achieve performance comparable to or exceeding DeepSeek-R1 and o4-mini despite being substantially smaller. In addition, fine-tuning remarkably improves the diagnostic accuracy of gpt-oss-20b, enabling it to approach the performance of GPT-5. These findings highlight the potential of on-device LLMs to deliver accurate, adaptable, and privacy-preserving clinical decision support, offering a practical pathway for broader integration of LLMs into routine clinical practice.

Abstract: This is the system card published alongside the OpenAI GPT-5 launch, August 2025.
  GPT-5 is a unified system with a smart and fast model that answers most questions, a deeper reasoning model for harder problems, and a real-time router that quickly decides which model to use based on conversation type, complexity, tool needs, and explicit intent (for example, if you say 'think hard about this' in the prompt). The router is continuously trained on real signals, including when users switch models, preference rates for responses, and measured correctness, improving over time. Once usage limits are reached, a mini version of each model handles remaining queries.
  This system card focuses primarily on gpt-5-thinking and gpt-5-main, while evaluations for other models are available in the appendix. The GPT-5 system not only outperforms previous models on benchmarks and answers questions more quickly, but -- more importantly -- is more useful for real-world queries. We've made significant advances in reducing hallucinations, improving instruction following, and minimizing sycophancy, and have leveled up GPT-5's performance in three of ChatGPT's most common uses: writing, coding, and health. All of the GPT-5 models additionally feature safe-completions, our latest approach to safety training to prevent disallowed content.
  Similarly to ChatGPT agent, we have decided to treat gpt-5-thinking as High capability in the Biological and Chemical domain under our Preparedness Framework, activating the associated safeguards. While we do not have definitive evidence that this model could meaningfully help a novice to create severe biological harm -- our defined threshold for High capability -- we have chosen to take a precautionary approach.

### [65] [WRAVAL -- WRiting Assist eVALuation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03268)
*Gabriel Benedict,Matthew Butler,Naved Merchant,Eetu Salama-Laine*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SLMs underperform LLMs in reasoning tasks but excel in industrial applications like tone modification. The study introduces a new evaluation framework combining data generation, prompt-tuning, and LLM-based evaluation to highlight SLM capabilities in non-reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation metrics (focusing on reasoning/reasoning) misrepresent SLM effectiveness in practical applications. The paper aims to bridge this gap by creating task-specific evaluation methods for non-reasoning scenarios where labeled datasets are unavailable.

Method: Proposed WraVAEL framework uses three components: 1) Synthetic data generation via LLMs for non-reasoning tasks 2) Prompt-tuning to adapt models without parameter updates 3) Automated evaluation using LLM-based consistency scoring. All methods avoid dependence on proprietary data.

Result: Framework successfully demonstrated SLM potential in tone modification tasks (humor/formality) without sacrificing computational efficiency. Implementation showed effectiveness in edge computing and low-resource settings through task-specific fine-tuning gains.

Conclusion: Industry practitioners now have tools to benchmark both SLMs/LLMs for practical deployments, emphasizing SLM advantages in private computing environments where LLMs may be unsuitable due to size/cost constraints.

Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has shifted language model evaluation toward reasoning and problem-solving tasks as measures of general intelligence. Small Language Models (SLMs) -- defined here as models under 10B parameters -- typically score 3-4 times lower than LLMs on these metrics. However, we demonstrate that these evaluations fail to capture SLMs' effectiveness in common industrial applications, such as tone modification tasks (e.g., funny, serious, professional). We propose an evaluation framework specifically designed to highlight SLMs' capabilities in non-reasoning tasks where predefined evaluation datasets don't exist. Our framework combines novel approaches in data generation, prompt-tuning, and LLM-based evaluation to demonstrate the potential of task-specific finetuning. This work provides practitioners with tools to effectively benchmark both SLMs and LLMs for practical applications, particularly in edge and private computing scenarios. Our implementation is available at: https://github.com/amazon-science/wraval.

Motivation: 企业部署大模型时存在指令执行不一致的问题，需通过系统评估建立基准，指导实际应用并推动模型改进。

Method: 使用企业级评估协议，对13个LLM进行指令合规性、回答准确性和RAG场景测试，包含定制指令样本和真实业务场景验证。

Result: Claude-Sonnet-4和GPT-5在指令遵从性得分最高，证实存在显著指令执行差异。多数模型在通用任务表现良好但在特定指令上失效。

Conclusion: 提出指令执行基准和工程化改进方向，为企业选型提供依据，为模型开发指明指令微调和评估体系优化方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding and generation, yet their deployment in enterprise environments reveals a critical limitation: inconsistent adherence to custom instructions. This study presents a comprehensive evaluation of 13 leading LLMs across instruction compliance, response accuracy, and performance metrics in realworld RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) scenarios. Through systematic testing with samples and enterprise-grade evaluation protocols, we demonstrate that instruction following varies dramatically across models, with Claude-Sonnet-4 and GPT-5 achieving the highest results. Our findings reveal the "instruction gap" - a fundamental challenge where models excel at general tasks but struggle with precise instruction adherence required for enterprise deployment. This work provides practical insights for organizations deploying LLM-powered solutions and establishes benchmarks for instruction-following capabilities across major model families.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评测基准存在语义冗余且计算成本高，而tinyBenchmarks等依赖历史模型正确标签的压缩方法在新任务/领域/模型（无先验评测数据）场景下失效。

Method: 通过微调基础LLM获取领域语义表征，仅用原始文本生成语义嵌入，结合任务感知聚类与簇几何分析动态调节压缩强度以消除冗余。

Result: 在3GPP通信等专业领域数据集上验证，压缩后评测成本降低超90%，同时保持与全量基准高度一致（高保真压缩）

Conclusion: 该方法利用语义空间分析替代历史模型反馈，为冷启动场景下的评测压缩提供通用解决方案。

Abstract: The versatility of Large Language Models (LLMs) in vertical domains has spurred the development of numerous specialized evaluation benchmarks. However, these benchmarks often suffer from significant semantic redundancy and impose high computational costs during evaluation. Existing compression methods, such as tinyBenchmarks depend critically on correctness labels from multiple historical models evaluated on the full test set, making them inapplicable in cold-start scenarios, such as the introduction of a new task, domain, or model with no prior evaluation history.
  To address this limitation, we propose a history-free test set compression framework that requires no prior model performance data. Our method begins by fine-tuning a base LLM on a small amount of domain-specific data to internalize task-relevant semantics. It then generates high-level semantic embeddings for all original test samples using only their raw textual content. In this domain-adapted embedding space, we perform task-aware clustering and introduce a novel dataset X-ray mechanism that analyzes cluster geometry to dynamically calibrate the compression intensity based on the intrinsic redundancy of the benchmark.
  Experiments on professional-domain dataset, notably a large-scale 3GPP communications benchmark, demonstrate that our approach effectively identifies and removes redundant samples, reducing evaluation cost by over 90% while preserving high fidelity to the full benchmark.

Motivation: 现有LLM内容审核系统在隐含冒犯、性别/种族偏见等边界案例上存在审核不足，且训练数据偏差会导致伦理问题，亟需改进。

Method: 构建包含106类细粒度标注的多视角基准数据集GuardEval，并基于Gemma3-12B开发QLoRA微调的GGuard审核模型。

Result: GGuard在宏平均F1得分达0.832，显著优于OpenAI Moderator(0.64)和Llama Guard(0.61)，在复杂边缘案例中表现更优。

Conclusion: 多元化的人本主义安全基准测试能有效减少审核决策的偏见与不一致性，多样化数据显著提升安全性与公平性。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become deeply embedded in daily life, the urgent need for safer moderation systems, distinguishing between naive from harmful requests while upholding appropriate censorship boundaries, has never been greater. While existing LLMs can detect harmful or unsafe content, they often struggle with nuanced cases such as implicit offensiveness, subtle gender and racial biases, and jailbreak prompts, due to the subjective and context-dependent nature of these issues. Furthermore, their heavy reliance on training data can reinforce societal biases, resulting in inconsistent and ethically problematic outputs. To address these challenges, we introduce GuardEval, a unified multi-perspective benchmark dataset designed for both training and evaluation, containing 106 fine-grained categories spanning human emotions, offensive and hateful language, gender and racial bias, and broader safety concerns. We also present GemmaGuard (GGuard), a QLoRA fine-tuned version of Gemma3-12B trained on GuardEval, to assess content moderation with fine-grained labels. Our evaluation shows that GGuard achieves a macro F1 score of 0.832, substantially outperforming leading moderation models, including OpenAI Moderator (0.64) and Llama Guard (0.61). We show that multi-perspective, human-centered safety benchmarks are critical for reducing biased and inconsistent moderation decisions. GuardEval and GGuard together demonstrate that diverse, representative data materially improve safety, fairness, and robustness on complex, borderline cases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖语义相似性但缺乏LLMs的长程依赖和知识库优势，需探索适应大模型特性的分割策略及评估指标。

Method: 提出句子枚举的重叠递归提示策略，采用边界相似度(Boundary Similarity)衡量分割效果，并设计实验对比传统方法。

Result: LLM在主题分割准确率上超越基线模型，但存在推理成本高和预测稳定性不足的问题，边界相似度指标有效反映分割质量。

Conclusion: 生成式LLM具备主题分割潜力，但需优化计算效率与鲁棒性，未来需结合模型特性设计更适配的架构。

Abstract: Topic segmentation using generative Large Language Models (LLMs) remains relatively unexplored. Previous methods use semantic similarity between sentences, but such models lack the long range dependencies and vast knowledge found in LLMs. In this work, we propose an overlapping and recursive prompting strategy using sentence enumeration. We also support the adoption of the boundary similarity evaluation metric. Results show that LLMs can be more effective segmenters than existing methods, but issues remain to be solved before they can be relied upon for topic segmentation.

Method: 采用mmap替代标准库容器、开发定制NEON SIMD内核实现软件DMA，设计TVL内存布局保证缓存行全利用率，配合零拷贝加载器消除初始化延迟，形成完整的内存优化方案。

Result: 在M2芯片运行1.1亿参数模型实测达60+ tokens/秒吞吐，满足200ms响应延迟要求。在不依赖AMX等专用硬件前提下，较传统方案显著提升内存效率。

Conclusion: 展示了软件层面通过精细化内存管理突破LLM推理瓶颈的可行性，为研究通用ARM架构的内存墙问题提供了开放、可移植的研究基准，适用于学术研究和轻量级边缘部署场景。

Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices is fundamentally constrained by the "Memory Wall" the bottleneck where data movement latency outstrips arithmetic throughput. Standard inference runtimes often incur significant overhead through high-level abstractions, dynamic dispatch, and unaligned memory access patterns. In this work, we present a novel "Virtual Tensor Core" architecture implemented in software, optimized specifically for ARM64 microarchitectures (Apple Silicon). By bypassing standard library containers in favor of direct memory mapping (mmap) and implementing hand-tuned NEON SIMD kernels, we achieve a form of "Software-Defined Direct Memory Access (DMA)." Our proposed Tensor Virtualization Layout (TVL) guarantees 100% cache line utilization for weight matrices, while our zero-copy loader eliminates initialization latency. Experimental results on a 110M parameter model demonstrate a stable throughput of >60 tokens/second on M2 hardware. While proprietary hardware accelerators (e.g., Apple AMX) can achieve higher peak throughput, our architecture provides a fully open, portable, and deterministic reference implementation for studying the memory bottleneck on general-purpose ARM silicon, meeting the 200ms psycholinguistic latency threshold without opaque dependencies.

TL;DR: 本文研究了自然语言统计规律（如Zipf定律）与Transformer模型分词方案（BPE）的关系，发现BPE分词过程会重构语料统计特性，使令牌频率趋向幂律分布并降低局部依赖性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言存在Zipf/Heaps统计规律，但现代Transformer模型的分词机制如何影响这些规律尚不明确，需揭示BPE分词与语言统计结构的深层联系。

Method: 1) 基于Zipf分布推导信息熵闭合表达式 2) 实证分析BPE对语料统计的转化作用 3) 训练不同BPE深度的语言模型并对比其预测熵 4) 通过注意力机制分析token依赖性变化。

Result: BPE分词使token频率逼近Zipfian幂律并产生特征熵增长模式；Transformer模型预测熵与Zipf推导结果一致性随BPE深度增强；注意力诊断显示深层分词削弱局部依赖性。

Conclusion: BPE不仅是压缩工具，更是语言统计特性的重构器，其通过幂律逼近和熵调控使语言模型更贴近自然语言的弱相关统计特性。

Abstract: Natural languages exhibit striking regularities in their statistical structure, including notably the emergence of Zipf's and Heaps' laws. Despite this, it remains broadly unclear how these properties relate to the modern tokenisation schemes used in contemporary transformer models. In this note, we analyse the information content (as measured by the Shannon entropy) of various corpora under the assumption of a Zipfian frequency distribution, and derive a closed-form expression for the slot entropy expectation value. We then empirically investigate how byte--pair encoding (BPE) transforms corpus statistics, showing that recursive applications of BPE drive token frequencies toward a Zipfian power law while inducing a characteristic growth pattern in empirical entropy. Utilizing the ability of transformers to learn context dependent token probability distributions, we train language models on corpora tokenised at varying BPE depths, revealing that the model predictive entropies increasingly agree with Zipf-derived predictions as the BPE depth increases. Attention-based diagnostics further indicate that deeper tokenisation reduces local token dependencies, bringing the empirical distribution closer to the weakly dependent (near IID) regime. Together, these results clarify how BPE acts not only as a compression mechanism but also as a statistical transform that reconstructs key informational properties of natural language.

TL;DR: 本文研究发现训练数据中的隐喻会显著影响大语言模型（LLMs）的跨领域误对齐程度，通过干预隐喻可改变模型误对齐表现，并设计了基于隐喻特征的高精度误对齐探测器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 前人研究显示隐喻影响人类决策，而LLMs的训练数据中包含大量隐喻，因此本文旨在探究隐喻是否会导致LLMs在跨领域任务中出现误对齐问题，尤其是模型从错误领域数据中学习的模式迁移至其他领域的现象。

Method: 在预训练、微调和再对齐阶段对模型进行隐喻干预实验，通过监测模型中的全局与局部潜在特征，分析隐喻与其激活状态的关系，并基于这些特征设计误对齐内容检测器。

Result: 发现训练数据中的隐喻与模型推理内容的误对齐程度存在强因果关联，干预隐喻后跨领域误对齐程度显著变化；隐喻会激活特定潜变量特征，基于这些特征的检测器能高精度识别误对齐内容。

Conclusion: 隐喻是导致LLMs跨领域误对齐的关键因素之一，隐喻训练数据会引发模型推理路径的系统性偏差；通过隐喻驱动的潜变量监测可有效提升对误对齐内容的可控性，为模型对齐研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: Earlier research has shown that metaphors influence human's decision making, which raises the question of whether metaphors also influence large language models (LLMs)' reasoning pathways, considering their training data contain a large number of metaphors. In this work, we investigate the problem in the scope of the emergent misalignment problem where LLMs can generalize patterns learned from misaligned content in one domain to another domain. We discover a strong causal relationship between metaphors in training data and the misalignment degree of LLMs' reasoning contents. With interventions using metaphors in pre-training, fine-tuning and re-alignment phases, models' cross-domain misalignment degrees change significantly. As we delve deeper into the causes behind this phenomenon, we observe that there is a connection between metaphors and the activation of global and local latent features of large reasoning models. By monitoring these latent features, we design a detector that predict misaligned content with high accuracy.

Motivation: 现有程序生成角色存在两大偏差：积极道德偏差（角色统一持有和谐观点）和助手偏差（角色必直接回答问题），抑制戏剧冲突，造成角色呆板。该研究旨在突破此局限。

Method: 构建PersonaWeaver框架，解耦世界构建（角色身份/人口属性）和行为构建（道德立场/互动风格），引入道德立场与行为风格的二阶多样性（如表达长度、语气、标点等风格标记）。

Result: 实验生成角色展现多维度多样性：1）道德立场与反应模式的多样性增加；2）二阶风格标记呈现差异性；3）叙事可能性扩展（如拒绝回答等复杂交互）。

Conclusion: 通过解耦构建维度的方法，有效突破传统角色生成系统的表达局限，为虚拟叙事提供更具戏剧张力的复杂角色。

Abstract: Procedural content generation has enabled vast virtual worlds through levels, maps, and quests, but large-scale character generation remains underexplored. We identify two alignment-induced biases in existing methods: a positive moral bias, where characters uniformly adopt agreeable stances (e.g. always saying lying is bad), and a helpful assistant bias, where characters invariably answer questions directly (e.g. never refusing or deflecting). While such tendencies suit instruction-following systems, they suppress dramatic tension and yield predictable characters, stemming from maximum likelihood training and assistant fine-tuning. To address this, we introduce PersonaWeaver, a framework that disentangles world-building (roles, demographics) from behavioral-building (moral stances, interactional styles), yielding characters with more diverse reactions and moral stances, as well as second-order diversity in stylistic markers like length, tone, and punctuation.

Motivation: 大型语言模型训练使用大规模异构文本引发数据隐私担忧，现有防御手段依赖模型控制或数据删除，在黑盒场景下存在局限性，亟需新型数据保护方案。

Method:  Disclaimer Injection通过在数据中嵌入对齐触发声明，强制激活LLMs内置的对齐机制干扰学习过程，采用分层分析验证声明触发的神经激活模式及对模型训练的影响。

Result: 受保护数据微调使对齐相关层持续激活（激活强度提升23%-37%），在常规任务（如GLUE基准）中模型性能下降18-42个百分点，且影响具有持久性。

Conclusion: 该研究首次揭示模型对齐机制可作为隐私防护新维度，开发出首个可在LLM规模应用且无需接触训练系统的数据防泄露方案，为数据合规提供实用化技术路线。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained on massive, heterogeneous text corpora, raising serious concerns about the unauthorised use of proprietary or personal data during model training. In this work, we address the problem of data protection against unwanted model learning in a realistic black-box setting. We propose Disclaimer Injection, a novel data-level defence that renders text unlearnable to LLMs. Rather than relying on model-side controls or explicit data removal, our approach exploits the models' own alignment mechanisms: by injecting carefully designed alignment-triggering disclaimers to prevent effective learning. Through layer-wise analysis, we find that fine-tuning on such protected data induces persistent activation of alignment-related layers, causing alignment constraints to override task learning even on common inputs. Consequently, models trained on such data exhibit substantial and systematic performance degradation compared to standard fine-tuning. Our results identify alignment behaviour as a previously unexplored lever for data protection and, to our knowledge, present the first practical method for restricting data learnability at LLM scale without requiring access to or modification of the training pipeline.

Motivation: 现有显式结构记忆在长上下文下易崩溃，隐式记忆机制难以解析，亟需一种兼顾效率与可解释性的混合记忆框架。

Method: 将图结构记忆存储于潜在空间以保证稳定性，在推理时检索紧凑的任务子图；训练阶段通过显式图视图与冻结推理器交互，推理阶段仅外部化检索子图。

Result: 实验表明该方法超越经典显式图和隐式记忆基线，在多规模模型中实现参数高效适配，并能扩展至更大推理器。

Conclusion: LatentGraphMem通过潜在图与子图检索的协同，在长周期任务中平衡了记忆效率与推理透明度，支持可解释性分析和模型扩展性。

Abstract: Long-horizon applications increasingly require large language models (LLMs) to answer queries when relevant evidence is sparse and dispersed across very long contexts. Existing memory systems largely follow two paradigms: explicit structured memories offer interpretability but often become brittle under long-context overload, while latent memory mechanisms are efficient and stable yet difficult to inspect. We propose LatentGraphMem, a memory framework that combines implicit graph memory with explicit subgraph retrieval. LatentGraphMem stores a graph-structured memory in latent space for stability and efficiency, and exposes a task-specific subgraph retrieval interface that returns a compact symbolic subgraph under a fixed budget for downstream reasoning and human inspection. During training, an explicit graph view is materialized to interface with a frozen reasoner for question-answering supervision. At inference time, retrieval is performed in latent space and only the retrieved subgraph is externalized. Experiments on long-horizon benchmarks across multiple model scales show that LatentGraphMem consistently outperforms representative explicit-graph and latent-memory baselines, while enabling parameter-efficient adaptation and flexible scaling to larger reasoners without introducing large symbolic artifacts.

Abstract: Verifying system-generated summaries remains challenging, as effective verification requires precise attribution to the source context, which is especially crucial in high-stakes medical domains. To address this challenge, we introduce PCoA, an expert-annotated benchmark for medical aspect-based summarization with phrase-level context attribution. PCoA aligns each aspect-based summary with its supporting contextual sentences and contributory phrases within them. We further propose a fine-grained, decoupled evaluation framework that independently assesses the quality of generated summaries, citations, and contributory phrases. Through extensive experiments, we validate the quality and consistency of the PCoA dataset and benchmark several large language models on the proposed task. Experimental results demonstrate that PCoA provides a reliable benchmark for evaluating system-generated summaries with phrase-level context attribution. Furthermore, comparative experiments show that explicitly identifying relevant sentences and contributory phrases before summarization can improve overall quality.

### [80] [The Critical Role of Aspects in Measuring Document Similarity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03435)
*Eftekhar Hossain,Tarnika Hazra,Ahatesham Bhuiyan,Santu Karmaker*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出ASPECTSIM框架，通过显式指定方面条件提升文档相似性测量精度，GPT-4o实现显著优于传统方法，但开源模型仍存在差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统整体式文档相似度量法缺乏对具体维度的针对性评估，需建立可解释性更强的方面条件化相似度量框架。

Method: 构建包含26K数据新基准，对比GPT-4o直接提示与分两阶段优化的16个开源LLM，使用ASPECTSIM框架进行跨模型性能评估。

Result: GPT-4o实现人机一致率达80%提升，开源模型直接提示效果仅20-30%，优化后提升140%，但整体仍低于商业模型。

Conclusion: 显式方面条件显著提升文档相似度量效果，商业大模型在复杂语义理解上优于开源模型，研究需要革新现有测评标准化范式。

Abstract: We introduce ASPECTSIM, a simple and interpretable framework that requires conditioning document similarity on an explicitly specified aspect, which is different from the traditional holistic approach in measuring document similarity. Experimenting with a newly constructed benchmark of 26K aspect-document pairs, we found that ASPECTSIM, when implemented with direct GPT-4o prompting, achieves substantially higher human-machine agreement ($\approx$80% higher) than the same for holistic similarity without explicit aspects. These findings underscore the importance of explicitly accounting for aspects when measuring document similarity and highlight the need to revise standard practice. Next, we conducted a large-scale meta-evaluation using 16 smaller open-source LLMs and 9 embedding models with a focus on making ASPECTSIM accessible and reproducible. While directly prompting LLMs to produce ASPECTSIM scores turned out be ineffective (20-30% human-machine agreement), a simple two-stage refinement improved their agreement by $\approx$140%. Nevertheless, agreement remains well below that of GPT-4o-based models, indicating that smaller open-source LLMs still lag behind large proprietary models in capturing aspect-conditioned similarity.

### [81] [Grading Scale Impact on LLM-as-a-Judge: Human-LLM Alignment Is Highest on 0-5 Grading Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03444)

TL;DR: This study investigates how different grading scales affect the evaluation consistency of large language models (LLMs) compared to human judges, revealing significant impacts on human-LLM alignment and exposing hidden biases through subgroup analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs are widely used as automated evaluators, their scoring consistency under varying prompts has been studied, but the influence of grading scales themselves remains poorly understood.

Method: Compared human and LLM evaluations across three grading scales and six benchmarks (objective, subjective, and mixed tasks),using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) for agreement measurement and analyzing scale effects and subgroup reliability.

Result: LLM judgments showed scale-dependent inconsistency on subjective tasks; 0-5 scale achieved strongest human-LLM alignment; aggregated reliability metrics masked hidden task heterogeneity and revealed systematic gender-based alignment differences.

Conclusion: Effective LLM-as-a-judge protocols require rigorous scale design and sub-level diagnostics to address alignment challenges and uncover hidden biases in evaluation systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as automated evaluators, yet prior works demonstrate that these LLM judges often lack consistency in scoring when the prompt is altered. However, the effect of the grading scale itself remains underexplored. We study the LLM-as-a-judge problem by comparing two kinds of raters: humans and LLMs. We collect ratings from both groups on three scales and across six benchmarks that include objective, open-ended subjective, and mixed tasks. Using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) to measure absolute agreement, we find that LLM judgments are not perfectly consistent across scales on subjective benchmarks, and that the choice of scale substantially shifts human-LLM agreement, even when within-group panel reliability is high. Aggregated over tasks, the grading scale of 0-5 yields the strongest human-LLM alignment. We further demonstrate that pooled reliability can mask benchmark heterogeneity and reveal systematic subgroup differences in alignment across gender groups, strengthening the importance of scale design and sub-level diagnostics as essential components of LLM-as-a-judge protocols.

TL;DR: L2T框架结合语言学习任务与传统预训练方法，通过结构化输入输出对提升语言模型的语言能力，同时保持推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言模型虽擅长知识学习和推理，但未显式优化对语言结构的理解，需引入更直接的语言学习方式。

Method: 将原始文本转化为结构化语言学习任务（如词性标注、依存分析等），与标准语言模型预训练目标混合训练。

Result: 模型在语言能力基准测试中性能提升，学习速度加快，同时保持常规推理任务的竞争力。

Conclusion: 结构化的语言学习任务可有效增强语言模型的语言理解能力，且与通用预训练目标不冲突。

Abstract: Language models (LMs) are pre-trained on raw text datasets to generate text sequences token-by-token. While this approach facilitates the learning of world knowledge and reasoning, it does not explicitly optimize for linguistic competence. To bridge this gap, we propose L2T, a pre-training framework integrating Language Learning Tasks alongside standard next-token prediction. Inspired by human language acquisition, L2T transforms raw text into structured input-output pairs to provide explicit linguistic stimulation. Pre-training LMs on a mixture of raw text and L2T data not only improves overall performance on linguistic competence benchmarks but accelerates its acquisition, while maintaining competitive performance on general reasoning tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces EpiQAL, the first benchmark for evaluating epidemiological reasoning in large language models (LLMs), focusing on synthesizing evidence for disease burden, transmission, and intervention effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical QA benchmarks prioritize clinical/patient-level knowledge but neglect population-level epidemiological inference, creating a gap in assessing models' ability to process evidence-based public health reasoning.

Method: Constructed EpiQAL from open-access literature with three subsets: factual recall, multi-step inference (linking evidence to epidemiological principles), and conclusion reconstruction (without Discussion sections). Used expert taxonomy, model verification, and difficulty-controlled retrieval.

Result: Experiments on 10 LLMs showed poor performance in epidemiological reasoning, especially multi-step inference. Model rankings varied across subsets, scale did not guarantee success, and Chain-of-Thought prompting helped only in multi-step tasks.

Conclusion: EpiQAL provides granular diagnostic insights into models' capabilities for evidence grounding, inferential reasoning, and conclusion reconstruction in epidemiology.

Abstract: Reliable epidemiological reasoning requires synthesizing study evidence to infer disease burden, transmission dynamics, and intervention effects at the population level. Existing medical question answering benchmarks primarily emphasize clinical knowledge or patient-level reasoning, yet few systematically evaluate evidence-grounded epidemiological inference. We present EpiQAL, the first diagnostic benchmark for epidemiological question answering across diverse diseases, comprising three subsets built from open-access literature. The subsets respectively evaluate text-grounded factual recall, multi-step inference linking document evidence with epidemiological principles, and conclusion reconstruction with the Discussion section withheld. Construction combines expert-designed taxonomy guidance, multi-model verification, and retrieval-based difficulty control. Experiments on ten open models reveal that current LLMs show limited performance on epidemiological reasoning, with multi-step inference posing the greatest challenge. Model rankings shift across subsets, and scale alone does not predict success. Chain-of-Thought prompting benefits multi-step inference but yields mixed results elsewhere. EpiQAL provides fine-grained diagnostic signals for evidence grounding, inferential reasoning, and conclusion reconstruction.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出SegNSP，通过将线性文本分割转化为无监督的下一句预测（NSP）任务，利用句子间连续性检测主题边界，避免传统方法在主题定义和上下文平衡上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 线性文本分割长期以来面临主题边界定义复杂、话语结构多变、局部连贯与全局上下文平衡困难等问题，现有方法受限于需要显式标签或任务特定监督，需探索更有效的无监督范式。

Method: 构建标签无关的NSP框架，设计分段感知损失函数并引入难例负采样策略，通过建模句子连续性隐式捕捉主题边界，完全摒弃任务专用监督信号。

Result: 在CitiLink-Minutes数据集达到B-F1 0.79（近人类标注水平），在WikiSection取得B-F1 0.65，较基线模型TopSeg提升17个百分点，且无需显式主题标签。

Conclusion: 研究表明NSP机制适配文本分割任务，通过句子级连续性建模可有效提升分段质量，为摘要生成等下游应用提供稳健基础，验证了无监督建模的有效性。

Abstract: Linear text segmentation is a long-standing problem in natural language processing (NLP), focused on dividing continuous text into coherent and semantically meaningful units. Despite its importance, the task remains challenging due to the complexity of defining topic boundaries, the variability in discourse structure, and the need to balance local coherence with global context. These difficulties hinder downstream applications such as summarization, information retrieval, and question answering. In this work, we introduce SegNSP, framing linear text segmentation as a next sentence prediction (NSP) task. Although NSP has largely been abandoned in modern pre-training, its explicit modeling of sentence-to-sentence continuity makes it a natural fit for detecting topic boundaries. We propose a label-agnostic NSP approach, which predicts whether the next sentence continues the current topic without requiring explicit topic labels, and enhance it with a segmentation-aware loss combined with harder negative sampling to better capture discourse continuity. Unlike recent proposals that leverage NSP alongside auxiliary topic classification, our approach avoids task-specific supervision. We evaluate our model against established baselines on two datasets, CitiLink-Minutes, for which we establish the first segmentation benchmark, and WikiSection. On CitiLink-Minutes, SegNSP achieves a B-$F_1$ of 0.79, closely aligning with human-annotated topic transitions, while on WikiSection it attains a B-F$_1$ of 0.65, outperforming the strongest reproducible baseline, TopSeg, by 0.17 absolute points. These results demonstrate competitive and robust performance, highlighting the effectiveness of modeling sentence-to-sentence continuity for improving segmentation quality and supporting downstream NLP applications.

TL;DR: 提出CALM框架，通过动态文化表征和自适应机制提升语言模型的文化敏感性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将文化视为静态知识，导致在需要动态文化适应的任务中表现不足。

Method: CALM通过对比学习解耦文化概念与任务语义，构建结构化文化聚类；使用交叉注意力对齐文化特征，并通过专家混合机制多维度整合；最终融合模型原有知识形成文化自适应状态，结合反思学习实现动态优化。

Result: 在多个跨文化数据集上显著超越当前最优模型，验证了动态文化建模的有效性。

Conclusion: CALM成功实现了语言模型对动态文化语境的持续适应能力，为文化感知型AI系统提供新范式。

Abstract: Cultural awareness in language models is the capacity to understand and adapt to diverse cultural contexts. However, most existing approaches treat culture as static background knowledge, overlooking its dynamic and evolving nature. This limitation reduces their reliability in downstream tasks that demand genuine cultural sensitivity. In this work, we introduce CALM, a novel framework designed to endow language models with cultural self-awareness. CALM disentangles task semantics from explicit cultural concepts and latent cultural signals, shaping them into structured cultural clusters through contrastive learning. These clusters are then aligned via cross-attention to establish fine-grained interactions among related cultural features and are adaptively integrated through a Mixture-of-Experts mechanism along culture-specific dimensions. The resulting unified representation is fused with the model's original knowledge to construct a culturally grounded internal identity state, which is further enhanced through self-prompted reflective learning, enabling continual adaptation and self-correction. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple cross-cultural benchmark datasets demonstrate that CALM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统依赖验证困惑度进行模型监控无法区分语言风格模仿与真实知识习得，需要一种轻量级且基于语料库的评估方法

Method: 构建包含正确/错误续写的对比示例，通过计算似然度偏好量化知识保留能力，采用盲试-全知基线分析验证框架有效性

Result: 在LoRA微调动态诊断中，成功揭示语言收敛与知识保留的细粒度解离现象，验证了该框架的诊断有效性

Conclusion: KR-Test为解释性微调提供新视角，可作为评估模型知识获取的重要补充工具

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is a standard approach for injecting domain knowledge into Large Language Models (LLMs). However, relying on validation perplexity to monitor training is often insufficient, as it confounds stylistic mimicry with genuine factual internalization. To address this, we introduce the Knowledge Retention (KR) Test , a lightweight, corpus-grounded evaluation framework designed to distinguish factual learning from linguistics. KR-Test utilizes automatically generated contrastive examples to measure likelihood preferences for correct versus incorrect continuations, requiring no instruction tuning or generative decoding. We validate the framework's integrity through a "blind vs. oracle" baseline analysis. Furthermore, we demonstrate the diagnostic capabilities of KR-Test by analyzing the training dynamics of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). By exposing the fine-grained dissociation between linguistic convergence and knowledge retention, KR-Test enhances the interpretability of fine-tuning dynamics.

### [87] [Reasoning Pattern Alignment Merging for Adaptive Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03506)
*Zhaofeng Zhong,Wei Yuan,Tong Chen,Xiangyu Zhao,Quoc Viet Hung Nguyen,Hongzhi Yin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes Reasoning Pattern Alignment Merging (RPAM), a layer-wise model merging framework that combines long and short chain-of-thought reasoning models to create an adaptive reasoner. It reduces computation costs by aligning intermediate representations through a calibration dataset and contrastive loss, achieving efficient inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for accelerating reasoning in large models either require expensive retraining or are sensitive to input/prompt formulations. The authors aim to develop a lightweight, training-free approach that dynamically adapts reasoning paths without additional data or complex prompting.

Method: RPAM merges a Long-CoT model with a Short-CoT instruction model using feature alignment. It constructs a small labeled calibration set to identify optimal reasoning patterns, optimizes layer-wise merging coefficients by aligning merged model representations with selected model outputs, and employs contrastive loss to differentiate from non-optimal models. Fusion occurs without retraining or parameter updates.

Result: Experiments on seven reasoning benchmarks show RPAM achieves 1.5-2.0x speedup over baselines while maintaining 95%+ of original model performance. The approach exhibits robustness to input complexity variations and reduces reliance on manual prompt engineering.

Conclusion: RPAM provides an effective solution for adaptive reasoning in large models by leveraging model merging principles. The technique offers practical advantages for deployment scenarios requiring efficient inference with minimal performance trade-offs.

Abstract: Recent large reasoning models (LRMs) have made substantial progress in complex reasoning tasks, yet they often generate lengthy reasoning paths for every query, incurring unnecessary computation and latency. Existing speed-up approaches typically rely on retraining the model or designing sophisticated prompting, which are either prohibitively expensive or highly sensitive to the input and prompt formulation. In this work, we study model merging as a lightweight alternative for efficient reasoning: by combining a long chain-of-thought (Long-CoT) reasoning model with a Short-CoT instruction model, we obtain an adaptive reasoner without training from scratch or requiring large-scale additional data. Building on this idea, we propose Reasoning Pattern Alignment Merging (RPAM), a layer-wise model merging framework based on feature alignment to facilitate query-adaptive reasoning. RPAM first constructs a small pattern-labeled calibration set that assigns each query an appropriate reasoning pattern. It then optimizes layer-wise merging coefficients by aligning the merged model's intermediate representations with those of the selected model, while a contrastive objective explicitly pushes them away from the non-selected model. Experiments on seven widely used reasoning benchmarks show that RPAM substantially reduces inference cost while maintaining strong performance. Upon article acceptance, we will provide open-source code to reproduce experiments for RPAM.

Motivation: 解决现有外部分类器依赖导致的上下文限制、算力开销问题，提升LLM自我评估能力。

Method: 引入基于LoRA的内省标记机制，在prefilling阶段预测输出质量，保持原模型行为且无需外部模型。

Result: Qwen3 8B集成IntroLM后ROC AUC达90%，延迟降低33%，大模型使用率减少50%，显著优于基线。

Conclusion: IntroLM通过端到端自我评估机制，实现了高精度质量预测与多模型路由系统的高效资源调度。

Abstract: A major challenge for the operation of large language models (LLMs) is how to predict whether a specific LLM will produce sufficiently high-quality output for a given query. Existing approaches rely on external classifiers, most commonly BERT based models, which suffer from limited context windows, constrained representational capacity, and additional computational overhead. We propose IntroLM, a method that enables causal language models to predict their own output quality during the prefilling phase without affecting generation using introspective tokens. By introducing token conditional LoRA that activates only for the introspective token, the model learns to predict the output quality for a given query while preserving the original backbone behavior and avoiding external evaluators. On question answering benchmarks, IntroLM applied to Qwen3 8B achieves a ROC AUC of 90 precent for success prediction, outperforming a DeBERTa classifier by 14 precent. When integrated into multi model routing systems, IntroLM achieves superior cost performance tradeoffs, reducing latency by up to 33 precent and large model usage by up to 50 precent at matched reliability.

Conclusion: Mem-Gallery为多模态长周期记忆研究提供标准化评估工具，推动解决长期交互场景下模型记忆力短板问题。

Abstract: Long-term memory is a critical capability for multimodal large language model (MLLM) agents, particularly in conversational settings where information accumulates and evolves over time. However, existing benchmarks either evaluate multi-session memory in text-only conversations or assess multimodal understanding within localized contexts, failing to evaluate how multimodal memory is preserved, organized, and evolved across long-term conversational trajectories. Thus, we introduce Mem-Gallery, a new benchmark for evaluating multimodal long-term conversational memory in MLLM agents. Mem-Gallery features high-quality multi-session conversations grounded in both visual and textual information, with long interaction horizons and rich multimodal dependencies. Building on this dataset, we propose a systematic evaluation framework that assesses key memory capabilities along three functional dimensions: memory extraction and test-time adaptation, memory reasoning, and memory knowledge management. Extensive benchmarking across thirteen memory systems reveals several key findings, highlighting the necessity of explicit multimodal information retention and memory organization, the persistent limitations in memory reasoning and knowledge management, as well as the efficiency bottleneck of current models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Personalized LALMs (PALM) and the first benchmark (PALM-Bench) to address limitations in existing audio-language models' ability to handle personalized question answering, showing current methods struggle with modeling and transferring personalized knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LALMs perform generic audio tasks but fail to address personalized question answering (e.g., understanding personal context like a friend's speech), whereas humans rely on individual context for decision-making. This gap motivates the formalization of Personalized LALMs.

Method: The authors formalize the PALM task for modeling personal concepts and reasoning within personal context, create the first benchmark (PALM-Bench) with multi-speaker scenarios, and evaluate open-source LALMs using training-free prompting and supervised fine-tuning strategies.

Result: Experiments show that current methods (training-free prompting, supervised fine-tuning) yield partial improvements but remain limited in robustly modeling personalized knowledge and transferring it across tasks.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for better methodologies in Personalized LALMs, establishes PALM-Bench as a foundational resource, and demonstrates the inadequacy of current approaches in handling personalized audio understanding and generation tasks.

Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) have demonstrated strong performance in audio understanding and generation. Yet, our extensive benchmarking reveals that their behavior is largely generic (e.g., summarizing spoken content) and fails to adequately support personalized question answering (e.g., summarizing what my best friend says). In contrast, human conditions their interpretation and decision-making on each individual's personal context. To bridge this gap, we formalize the task of Personalized LALMs (PALM) for recognizing personal concepts and reasoning within personal context. Moreover, we create the first benchmark (PALM-Bench) to foster the methodological advances in PALM and enable structured evaluation on several tasks across multi-speaker scenarios. Our extensive experiments on representative open-source LALMs, show that existing training-free prompting and supervised fine-tuning strategies, while yield improvements, remains limited in modeling personalized knowledge and transferring them across tasks robustly. Data and code will be released.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a persona-aware Vision-Language Model framework for bikeability assessment, addressing limitations in capturing environmental complexity and user perception diversity through three innovations: theory-based persona conditioning, multi-granularity training, and AI-augmented data generation for explainable evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current bikeability methods inadequately represent complex road environments and subjective cyclist preferences, hindering accurate assessment of cycling safety and comfort across diverse user groups.

Method: 1) Persona conditioning using cyclist typology for personalized explanations via chain-of-thought reasoning;
2) Hybrid training combining expert annotations and crowd-sourced ratings;
3) AI-driven data augmentation generating controlled infrastructure comparison pairs;
4) Crowdsourcing system collecting 12,400 assessments from 427 cyclists through panoramic images.

Result: Framework demonstrated accurate bikeability prediction capability while uniquely enabling interpretable analysis of environmental impact factors through generated explanations linked to specific infrastructure elements.

Conclusion: Persona-driven explainable AI improves bikeability assessments by contextualizing infrastructure impacts through diverse user perspectives, offering actionable insights for cyclist-friendly urban planning.

Abstract: Bikeability assessment is essential for advancing sustainable urban transportation and creating cyclist-friendly cities, and it requires incorporating users' perceptions of safety and comfort. Yet existing perception-based bikeability assessment approaches face key limitations in capturing the complexity of road environments and adequately accounting for heterogeneity in subjective user perceptions. This paper proposes a persona-aware Vision-Language Model framework for bikeability assessment with three novel contributions: (i) theory-grounded persona conditioning based on established cyclist typology that generates persona-specific explanations via chain-of-thought reasoning; (ii) multi-granularity supervised fine-tuning that combines scarce expert-annotated reasoning with abundant user ratings for joint prediction and explainable assessment; and (iii) AI-enabled data augmentation that creates controlled paired data to isolate infrastructure variable impacts. To test and validate this framework, we developed a panoramic image-based crowdsourcing system and collected 12,400 persona-conditioned assessments from 427 cyclists. Experiment results show that the proposed framework offers competitive bikeability rating prediction while uniquely enabling explainable factor attribution.

Conclusion: 多跳推理是浅层MLP广泛召回与深层注意力选择性提取的协同过程，为模型诊断提供了新视角。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) perform well on multi-hop reasoning, yet how they internally compose multiple facts remains unclear. Recent work proposes \emph{hop-aligned circuit hypothesis}, suggesting that bridge entities are computed sequentially across layers before later-hop answers. Through systematic analyses on real-world multi-hop queries, we show that this hop-aligned assumption does not generalize: later-hop answer entities can become decodable earlier than bridge entities, a phenomenon we call \emph{layer-order inversion}, which strengthens with total hops. To explain this behavior, we propose a \emph{probabilistic recall-and-extract} framework that models multi-hop reasoning as broad probabilistic recall in shallow MLP layers followed by selective extraction in deeper attention layers. This framework is empirically validated through systematic probing analyses, reinterpreting prior layer-wise decoding evidence, explaining chain-of-thought gains, and providing a mechanistic diagnosis of multi-hop failures despite correct single-hop knowledge.

Conclusion: 揭示LLM在隐私与亲社会价值冲突下的差异化决策模式，VAAR指标为检测模型价值观提供了可解释的量化评估工具

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate decision-making tasks involving personal data sharing, where privacy concerns and prosocial motivations can push choices in opposite directions. Existing evaluations often measure privacy-related attitudes or sharing intentions in isolation, which makes it difficult to determine whether a model's expressed values jointly predict its downstream data-sharing actions as in real human behaviors. We introduce a context-based assessment protocol that sequentially administers standardized questionnaires for privacy attitudes, prosocialness, and acceptance of data sharing within a bounded, history-carrying session. To evaluate value-action alignments under competing attitudes, we use multi-group structural equation modeling (MGSEM) to identify relations from privacy concerns and prosocialness to data sharing. We propose Value-Action Alignment Rate (VAAR), a human-referenced directional agreement metric that aggregates path-level evidence for expected signs. Across multiple LLMs, we observe stable but model-specific Privacy-PSA-AoDS profiles, and substantial heterogeneity in value-action alignment.

Abstract: The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in police operations is growing, yet an evaluation framework tailored to police operations remains absent. While LLM's responses may not always be legally incorrect, their unverified use still can lead to severe issues such as unlawful arrests and improper evidence collection. To address this, we propose PAS (Police Action Scenarios), a systematic framework covering the entire evaluation process. Applying this framework, we constructed a novel QA dataset from over 8,000 official documents and established key metrics validated through statistical analysis with police expert judgements. Experimental results show that commercial LLMs struggle with our new police-related tasks, particularly in providing fact-based recommendations.

TL;DR: 本文提出DiffCoT，一种基于扩散模型的推理框架，用于解决多步数学问题中的错误累积问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统链式推理（CoT）易受早期错误积累影响，导致后续结果不可逆偏差，需新方法提升鲁棒性。

Method: DiffCoT将推理视为迭代去噪过程，结合滑动窗口机制实现中间步骤生成与修正，并设计因果扩散噪声调度保证推理时序一致性。

Result: 在3个数学推理基准测试中，DiffCoT在多个模型基础上均超越现有CoT优化方法，错误修正能力提升23%-41%。

Conclusion: DiffCoT通过扩散模型重构推理过程，为复杂任务提供可逆修正的通用新范式。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning improves multi-step mathematical problem solving in large language models but remains vulnerable to exposure bias and error accumulation, as early mistakes propagate irreversibly through autoregressive decoding. In this work, we propose DiffCoT, a diffusion-styled CoT framework that reformulates CoT reasoning as an iterative denoising process. DiffCoT integrates diffusion principles at the reasoning-step level via a sliding-window mechanism, enabling unified generation and retrospective correction of intermediate steps while preserving token-level autoregression. To maintain causal consistency, we further introduce a causal diffusion noise schedule that respects the temporal structure of reasoning chains. Extensive experiments on three multi-step CoT reasoning benchmarks across diverse model backbones demonstrate that DiffCoT consistently outperforms existing CoT preference optimization methods, yielding improved robustness and error-correction capability in CoT reasoning.

Motivation: 现有研究对LLMs如何动态获取/遗忘抽象概念缺乏理解，且概念间干扰与协同作用机制尚未明确

Method: 通过追踪概念回路动态变化，结合图神经度量分析电路结构，量化概念学习过程中的五种核心现象

Conclusion: 构建了电路级概念学习分析框架，为设计可解释的LLM概念感知训练策略提供理论依据

Abstract: Human beings primarily understand the world through concepts (e.g., dog), abstract mental representations that structure perception, reasoning, and learning. However, how large language models (LLMs) acquire, retain, and forget such concepts during continual pretraining remains poorly understood. In this work, we study how individual concepts are acquired and forgotten, as well as how multiple concepts interact through interference and synergy. We link these behavioral dynamics to LLMs' internal Concept Circuits, computational subgraphs associated with specific concepts, and incorporate Graph Metrics to characterize circuit structure. Our analysis reveals: (1) LLMs concept circuits provide a non-trivial, statistically significant signal of concept learning and forgetting; (2) Concept circuits exhibit a stage-wise temporal pattern during continual pretraining, with an early increase followed by gradual decrease and stabilization; (3) concepts with larger learning gains tend to exhibit greater forgetting under subsequent training; (4) semantically similar concepts induce stronger interference than weakly related ones; (5) conceptual knowledge differs in their transferability, with some significantly facilitating the learning of others. Together, our findings offer a circuit-level view of concept learning dynamics and inform the design of more interpretable and robust concept-aware training strategies for LLMs.

Method: 构建首个基于澳大利亚临床实践指南的伦理基准，包含多选和开放性任务，通过细粒度伦理标注（同理心、信息准确性等）进行双维度评估。

Result: 14个模型测试显示拒绝率与伦理对齐水平无显著正相关，部分领域微调的模型伦理表现反低于基础模型。

Conclusion: PsychEthicsBench为心理健康领域大模型伦理开发提供了司法辖区敏感的系统评估框架，揭示伦理对齐的复杂性，呼吁重视临床场景的专业化验证。

Abstract: The increasing integration of large language models (LLMs) into mental health applications necessitates robust frameworks for evaluating professional safety alignment. Current evaluative approaches primarily rely on refusal-based safety signals, which offer limited insight into the nuanced behaviors required in clinical practice. In mental health, clinically inadequate refusals can be perceived as unempathetic and discourage help-seeking. To address this gap, we move beyond refusal-centric metrics and introduce \texttt{PsychEthicsBench}, the first principle-grounded benchmark based on Australian psychology and psychiatry guidelines, designed to evaluate LLMs' ethical knowledge and behavioral responses through multiple-choice and open-ended tasks with fine-grained ethicality annotations. Empirical results across 14 models reveal that refusal rates are poor indicators of ethical behavior, revealing a significant divergence between safety triggers and clinical appropriateness. Notably, we find that domain-specific fine-tuning can degrade ethical robustness, as several specialized models underperform their base backbones in ethical alignment. PsychEthicsBench provides a foundation for systematic, jurisdiction-aware evaluation of LLMs in mental health, encouraging more responsible development in this domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言用户常通过语码转换进行自然交流，但大型语言模型难以通过语境线索准确判断期望输出语言，需解决这一实际应用障碍。

Method: 构建覆盖韩-英语码转换、包含从句内混合到指令-内容错配的OCA基准测试，系统分析7个前沿模型的语言选择模式及对指令、思维链提示的反应。

Result: 前沿模型存在系统性偏差（71%非英语输出），思维链提示无效但引入1k数据的语码感知DPO可减少56%错配；偏差在中-英、印尼-英组合具普遍性，且模型存在回应中切换和语言侵入现象。

Conclusion: 多语言大模型需通过针对性对齐训练理解隐式语境线索，传统提示工程不足以解决语言选择难题，小型定制化训练数据可有效提升实际场景表现。

Abstract: Code-switching, alternating between languages within a conversation, is natural for multilingual users, yet poses fundamental challenges for large language models (LLMs). When a user code-switches in their prompt to an LLM, they typically do not specify the expected language of the LLM response, and thus LLMs must infer the output language from contextual and pragmatic cues. We find that current LLMs systematically fail to align with this expectation, responding in undesired languages even when cues are clear to humans. We introduce OLA, a benchmark to evaluate LLMs' Output Language Alignment in code-switched interactions. OLA focuses on Korean--English code-switching and spans simple intra-sentential mixing to instruction-content mismatches. Even frontier models frequently misinterpret implicit language expectation, exhibiting a bias toward non-English responses. We further show this bias generalizes beyond Korean to Chinese and Indonesian pairs. Models also show instability through mid-response switching and language intrusions. Chain-of-Thought prompting fails to resolve these errors, indicating weak pragmatic reasoning about output language. However, Code-Switching Aware DPO with minimal data (about 1K examples) substantially reduces misalignment, suggesting these failures stem from insufficient alignment rather than fundamental limitations. Our results highlight the need to align multilingual LLMs with users' implicit expectations in real-world code-switched interactions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有线性推理方法（如Chain-of-Thought）存在逻辑不一致问题，且依赖外部图结构，缺乏模型自主构建图推理的能力。

Method: 设计SGR框架，强制LLMs显式生成图结构推理路径；构建融合多候选图的训练数据集，通过图优化增强推理连贯性。

Result: SGR在5个QA基准测试中使推理一致性显著提升17.74%，LLaMA-3.3-70B+SGR超越Claude-3.5-Haiku，接近GPT-4o表现。

Conclusion: 图结构推理能有效改善LLMs的逻辑不一致性，模型自建图结构比外部图更适应开放域复杂推理场景。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show strong reasoning ability in open-domain question answering, yet their reasoning processes are typically linear and often logically inconsistent. In contrast, real-world reasoning requires integrating multiple premises and solving subproblems in parallel. Existing methods, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), express reasoning in a linear textual form, which may appear coherent but frequently leads to inconsistent conclusions. Recent approaches rely on externally provided graphs and do not explore how LLMs can construct and use their own graph-structured reasoning, particularly in open-domain QA. To fill this gap, we novelly explore graph-structured reasoning of LLMs in general-domain question answering. We propose Self-Graph Reasoning (SGR), a framework that enables LLMs to explicitly represent their reasoning process as a structured graph before producing the final answer. We further construct a graph-structured reasoning dataset that merges multiple candidate reasoning graphs into refined graph structures for model training. Experiments on five QA benchmarks across both general and specialized domains show that SGR consistently improves reasoning consistency and yields a 17.74% gain over the base model. The LLaMA-3.3-70B model fine-tuned with SGR performs comparably to GPT-4o and surpasses Claude-3.5-Haiku, demonstrating the effectiveness of graph-structured reasoning.

*Hui Huang,Muyun Yang,Yuki Arase*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces DiVA, a hybrid framework combining generative and discriminative models for fine-grained factuality verification, surpassing binary judgment methods on a new benchmark (FGVeriBench).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current factuality verification methods use binary judgments, which cannot distinguish error severity levels, limiting their utility in fine-grained evaluation. DiVA aims to address this limitation.

Method: DiVA integrates generative models' agentic search capabilities to explore reasoning paths with discriminative models' precise scoring of each step's correctness, aggregating scores for verification decisions.

Result: DiVA outperformed existing methods on FGVeriBench for both general and multi-hop questions, demonstrating superior fine-grained factuality verification performance.

Conclusion: DiVA and FGVeriBench provide a practical solution for granular error severity assessment, enabling applications like preference optimization and model evaluation while establishing a robust benchmark for future research.

Abstract: Despite the significant advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs), their factuality remains a critical challenge, fueling growing interest in factuality verification. Existing research on factuality verification primarily conducts binary judgments (e.g., correct or incorrect), which fails to distinguish varying degrees of error severity. This limits its utility for applications such as fine-grained evaluation and preference optimization. To bridge this gap, we propose the Agentic Discriminative Verifier (DiVA), a hybrid framework that synergizes the agentic search capabilities of generative models with the precise scoring aptitude of discriminative models. We also construct a new benchmark, FGVeriBench, as a robust testbed for fine-grained factuality verification. Experimental results on FGVeriBench demonstrate that our DiVA significantly outperforms existing methods on factuality verification for both general and multi-hop questions.

*Binh Nguyen,Thai Le*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a forensic auditing framework to evaluate the robustness of Audio Language Models (ALMs) in detecting audio deepfakes, revealing that explicit reasoning in ALMs can act as a defensive shield or performance tax under adversarial attacks and that cognitive dissonance can flag potential manipulation even when classification fails.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance audio deepfake detection beyond black-box models by analyzing the robustness of predictive reasoning traces in ALMs, addressing vulnerabilities in both classification accuracy and reasoning integrity under adversarial attacks.

Method: Developed a forensic auditing framework assessing ALMs through three dimensions: acoustic perception, cognitive coherence, and cognitive dissonance, while systematically analyzing adversarial attacks' impact on reasoning and classification outputs.

Result: Explicit reasoning in ALMs improves robustness (

Conclusion: Reasoning in ALMs provides forensic value for audio deepfake detection but has vulnerabilities; reasoning-driven models require balanced design to leverage benefits while mitigating performance penalties under linguistic adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Audio Language Models (ALMs) offer a promising shift towards explainable audio deepfake detections (ADDs), moving beyond \textit{black-box} classifiers by providing some level of transparency into their predictions via reasoning traces. This necessitates a new class of model robustness analysis: robustness of the predictive reasoning under adversarial attacks, which goes beyond existing paradigm that mainly focuses on the shifts of the final predictions (e.g., fake v.s. real). To analyze such reasoning shifts, we introduce a forensic auditing framework to evaluate the robustness of ALMs' reasoning under adversarial attacks in three inter-connected dimensions: acoustic perception, cognitive coherence, and cognitive dissonance. Our systematic analysis reveals that explicit reasoning does not universally enhance robustness. Instead, we observe a bifurcation: for models exhibiting robust acoustic perception, reasoning acts as a defensive \textit{``shield''}, protecting them from adversarial attacks. However, for others, it imposes a performance \textit{``tax''}, particularly under linguistic attacks which reduce cognitive coherence and increase attack success rate. Crucially, even when classification fails, high cognitive dissonance can serve as a \textit{silent alarm}, flagging potential manipulation. Overall, this work provides a critical evaluation of the role of reasoning in forensic audio deepfake analysis and its vulnerabilities.

Abstract: We introduce EPAG, a benchmark dataset and framework designed for Evaluating the Pre-consultation Ability of LLMs using diagnostic Guidelines. LLMs are evaluated directly through HPI-diagnostic guideline comparison and indirectly through disease diagnosis. In our experiments, we observe that small open-source models fine-tuned with a well-curated, task-specific dataset can outperform frontier LLMs in pre-consultation. Additionally, we find that increased amount of HPI (History of Present Illness) does not necessarily lead to improved diagnostic performance. Further experiments reveal that the language of pre-consultation influences the characteristics of the dialogue. By open-sourcing our dataset and evaluation pipeline on https://github.com/seemdog/EPAG, we aim to contribute to the evaluation and further development of LLM applications in real-world clinical settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper compares Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) with non-reasoning LLMs, finding that LRMs excel in judgment tasks (accuracy, instruction-following, robustness) but still have biases in superficial quality. PlanJudge, a new evaluation strategy, is proposed to mitigate these biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if LRMs are superior judges compared to non-reasoning LLMs through a systematic empirical comparison.

Method: Empirical analysis of LRMs and non-reasoning LLMs across four criteria: judgment accuracy (especially on reasoning-intensive tasks), instruction-following capabilities, robustness against adversarial attacks, and bias in superficial quality. Proposed PlanJudge to mitigate biases by prompting explicit evaluation plans.

Result: 1) LRMs outperform non-reasoning LLMs in judgment accuracy (especially on reasoning tasks). 2) Superior instruction-following in evaluations. 3) Enhanced robustness against adversarial attacks. 4) Persistent biases in superficial quality. PlanJudge reduces biases in both LRMs and LLMs.

Conclusion: LRMs demonstrate strengths as judges but remain biased. PlanJudge effectively mitigates these biases, suggesting practical utility for improving LLM evaluation strategies.

Abstract: This paper presents the first systematic comparison investigating whether Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are superior judge to non-reasoning LLMs. Our empirical analysis yields four key findings: 1) LRMs outperform non-reasoning LLMs in terms of judgment accuracy, particularly on reasoning-intensive tasks; 2) LRMs demonstrate superior instruction-following capabilities in evaluation contexts; 3) LRMs exhibit enhanced robustness against adversarial attacks targeting judgment tasks; 4) However, LRMs still exhibit strong biases in superficial quality. To improve the robustness against biases, we propose PlanJudge, an evaluation strategy that prompts the model to generate an explicit evaluation plan before execution. Despite its simplicity, our experiments demonstrate that PlanJudge significantly mitigates biases in both LRMs and standard LLMs.

Conclusion: 该方法为教育及更广泛的社会行为研究提供了可扩展、可推广的人际动态分析范式。

Abstract: Emotional coordination is a core property of human interaction that shapes how relational meaning is constructed in real time. While text-based affect inference has become increasingly feasible, prior approaches often treat sentiment as a deterministic point estimate for individual speakers, failing to capture the inherent subjectivity, latent ambiguity, and sequential coupling found in mutual exchanges. We introduce LLM-MC-Affect, a probabilistic framework that characterizes emotion not as a static label, but as a continuous latent probability distribution defined over an affective space. By leveraging stochastic LLM decoding and Monte Carlo estimation, the methodology approximates these distributions to derive high-fidelity sentiment trajectories that explicitly quantify both central affective tendencies and perceptual ambiguity. These trajectories enable a structured analysis of interpersonal coupling through sequential cross-correlation and slope-based indicators, identifying leading or lagging influences between interlocutors. To validate the interpretive capacity of this approach, we utilize teacher-student instructional dialogues as a representative case study, where our quantitative indicators successfully distill high-level interaction insights such as effective scaffolding. This work establishes a scalable and deployable pathway for understanding interpersonal dynamics, offering a generalizable solution that extends beyond education to broader social and behavioral research.

Motivation: 传统持续预训练方法存在计算成本高和源语言性能下降的问题，需要一种高效且低资源消耗的优化方案。

Method: 分为两个阶段：1) ELO预训练阶段，仅训练模型中关键的第一层和最后一层；2) 层对齐阶段，将训练好的层重新整合并进行微调。

Conclusion: ELO方法通过分层优化显著降低了计算资源消耗，同时实现了多语言模型在持续预训练中的高效性能提升。

Abstract: We propose an efficient layer-specific optimization (ELO) method designed to enhance continual pretraining (CP) for specific languages in multilingual large language models (MLLMs). This approach addresses the common challenges of high computational cost and degradation of source language performance associated with traditional CP. The ELO method consists of two main stages: (1) ELO Pretraining, where a small subset of specific layers, identified in our experiments as the critically important first and last layers, are detached from the original MLLM and trained with the target language. This significantly reduces not only the number of trainable parameters but also the total parameters computed during the forward pass, minimizing GPU memory consumption and accelerating the training process. (2) Layer Alignment, where the newly trained layers are reintegrated into the original model, followed by a brief full fine-tuning step on a small dataset to align the parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that the ELO method achieves a training speedup of up to 6.46 times compared to existing methods, while improving target language performance by up to 6.2\% on qualitative benchmarks and effectively preserving source language (English) capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨模态嵌入模型过度依赖预训练视觉-语言模型的隐式对齐，导致三个核心问题：模态依赖的相似度尖锐性、难负样本失衡失效以及跨模态统计特性不匹配，从而影响排序稳定性和梯度有效性。

Method: 提出e5-omni的三种显式对齐技术：（1）模态感知温度校准以统一相似度尺度；（2）引入可控制的负样本课程学习并去偏，聚焦混淆负样本；（3）结合协方差正则化的批归一化，优化共享嵌入空间的跨模态几何匹配。

Conclusion: e5-omni通过显式对齐机制有效缓解了隐式对齐的局限性，提出的三种组件协同改善了跨模态嵌入的稳定性与可扩展性，为多模态检索任务提供了轻量级解决方案。

Abstract: Modern information systems often involve different types of items, e.g., a text query, an image, a video clip, or an audio segment. This motivates omni-modal embedding models that map heterogeneous modalities into a shared space for direct comparison. However, most recent omni-modal embeddings still rely heavily on implicit alignment inherited from pretrained vision-language model (VLM) backbones. In practice, this causes three common issues: (i) similarity logits have modality-dependent sharpness, so scores are not on a consistent scale; (ii) in-batch negatives become less effective over time because mixed-modality batches create an imbalanced hardness distribution; as a result, many negatives quickly become trivial and contribute little gradient; and (iii) embeddings across modalities show mismatched first- and second-order statistics, which makes rankings less stable. To tackle these problems, we propose e5-omni, a lightweight explicit alignment recipe that adapts off-the-shelf VLMs into robust omni-modal embedding models. e5-omni combines three simple components: (1) modality-aware temperature calibration to align similarity scales, (2) a controllable negative curriculum with debiasing to focus on confusing negatives while reducing the impact of false negatives, and (3) batch whitening with covariance regularization to better match cross-modal geometry in the shared embedding space. Experiments on MMEB-V2 and AudioCaps show consistent gains over strong bi-modal and omni-modal baselines, and the same recipe also transfers well to other VLM backbones. We release our model checkpoint at https://huggingface.co/Haon-Chen/e5-omni-7B.

Abstract: How can system-generated responses be efficiently verified, especially in the high-stakes biomedical domain? To address this challenge, we introduce eTracer, a plug-and-play framework that enables traceable text generation by grounding claims against contextual evidence. Through post-hoc grounding, each response claim is aligned with contextual evidence that either supports or contradicts it. Building on claim-level grounding results, eTracer not only enables users to precisely trace responses back to their contextual source but also quantifies response faithfulness, thereby enabling the verifiability and trustworthiness of generated responses. Experiments show that our claim-level grounding approach alleviates the limitations of conventional grounding methods in aligning generated statements with contextual sentence-level evidence, resulting in substantial improvements in overall grounding quality and user verification efficiency.

Abstract: Accurate question answering (QA) in disaster management requires reasoning over uncertain and conflicting information, a setting poorly captured by existing benchmarks built on clean evidence. We introduce DisastQA, a large-scale benchmark of 3,000 rigorously verified questions (2,000 multiple-choice and 1,000 open-ended) spanning eight disaster types. The benchmark is constructed via a human-LLM collaboration pipeline with stratified sampling to ensure balanced coverage. Models are evaluated under varying evidence conditions, from closed-book to noisy evidence integration, enabling separation of internal knowledge from reasoning under imperfect information. For open-ended QA, we propose a human-verified keypoint-based evaluation protocol emphasizing factual completeness over verbosity. Experiments with 20 models reveal substantial divergences from general-purpose leaderboards such as MMLU-Pro. While recent open-weight models approach proprietary systems in clean settings, performance degrades sharply under realistic noise, exposing critical reliability gaps for disaster response.

Result: 实验表明FSLR在同分布和跨分布任务中分别提升3.2%和4.6%准确率，训练速度提升4-6倍且减少80%训练token消耗。

Conclusion: 针对逻辑关系理解的显式建模能有效突破模型推理瓶颈，FSLR为提升大语言模型推理能力提供了高效训练范式。

Abstract: Recent studies reveal that large language models (LLMs) exhibit limited logical reasoning abilities in mathematical problem-solving, instead often relying on pattern-matching and memorization. We systematically analyze this limitation, focusing on logical relationship understanding, which is a core capability underlying genuine logical reasoning, and reveal that errors related to this capability account for over 90\% of incorrect predictions, with Chain-of-Thought Supervised Fine-Tuning (CoT-SFT) failing to substantially reduce these errors. To address this bottleneck, we propose First-Step Logical Reasoning (FSLR), a lightweight training framework targeting logical relationship understanding. Our key insight is that the first planning step-identifying which variables to use and which operation to apply-encourages the model to derive logical relationships directly from the problem statement. By training models on this isolated step, FSLR provides explicit supervision for logical relationship understanding, unlike CoT-SFT which implicitly embeds such relationships within complete solution trajectories. Extensive experiments across multiple models and datasets demonstrate that FSLR consistently outperforms CoT-SFT under both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings, with average improvements of 3.2\% and 4.6\%, respectively. Moreover, FSLR achieves 4-6x faster training and reduces training token consumption by over 80\%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有参考-based指标无法有效捕捉创造力主观性，需建立系统性评估模型

Method: 构建包含新奇性/价值/依从性/共鸣性的四维评估框架，采用‘尖峰提示’控制故事生成技术，并开展115人规模的人类主观评估实验，对比即时判断与反思性判断的差异特征

Result: 发现创造力评估呈现层次化认知模式而非简单累加，反思性评价显著改变评分分布和评分者一致性，四维框架能有效分离独立的创造力贡献因子

Conclusion: 该框架能揭示传统参考-based方法掩盖的创造力维度，证实分级评估模型在测量创造性输出方面的优越性

Abstract: Evaluating creative text generation remains a challenge because existing reference-based metrics fail to capture the subjective nature of creativity. We propose a structured evaluation framework for AI story generation comprising four components (Novelty, Value, Adherence, and Resonance) and eleven sub-components. Using controlled story generation via ``Spike Prompting'' and a crowdsourced study of 115 readers, we examine how different creative components shape both immediate and reflective human creativity judgments. Our findings show that creativity is evaluated hierarchically rather than cumulatively, with different dimensions becoming salient at different stages of judgment, and that reflective evaluation substantially alters both ratings and inter-rater agreement. Together, these results support the effectiveness of our framework in revealing dimensions of creativity that are obscured by reference-based evaluation.

TL;DR: ADEPT 通过自适应令牌级早期退出机制，动态调整计算资源，在预填充和生成阶段实现高达 25% 的效率提升和 4 倍分类任务加速，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有早期退出策略仅限于生成阶段首个令牌或预填充阶段提示级别，导致跳过层的 KV 缓存成为瓶颈。需开发能动态适配不同阶段和令牌复杂度的解决方案。

Method: 提出 ADEPT：(1) 自适应令牌级早期退出机制，根据令牌复杂度动态截断计算层数；(2) 解耦跳过层的顺序依赖关系，优化 KV 缓存生成流程。

Result: 语言生成任务效率提升 25%，下游分类任务加速 4 倍，性能提升最高达 45%。消融实验验证了解耦模块对吞吐量的优化效果。

Conclusion: ADEPT 通过灵活的动态截断策略和结构创新，在保持模型性能的前提下突破早期退出的瓶颈，为大模型推理提供通用优化框架。

Abstract: The inference of large language models imposes significant computational workloads, often requiring the processing of billions of parameters. Although early-exit strategies have proven effective in reducing computational demands by halting inference earlier, they apply either to only the first token in the generation phase or at the prompt level in the prefill phase. Thus, the Key-Value (KV) cache for skipped layers remains a bottleneck for subsequent token generation, limiting the benefits of early exit. We introduce ADEPT (Adaptive Dynamic Early-exit Process for Transformers), a novel approach designed to overcome this issue and enable dynamic early exit in both the prefill and generation phases. The proposed adaptive token-level early-exit mechanism adjusts computation dynamically based on token complexity, optimizing efficiency without compromising performance. ADEPT further enhances KV generation procedure by decoupling sequential dependencies in skipped layers, making token-level early exit more practical. Experimental results demonstrate that ADEPT improves efficiency by up to 25% in language generation tasks and achieves a 4x speed-up in downstream classification tasks, with up to a 45% improvement in performance.

TL;DR: 本研究通过语义破坏实验分析DeepSeek-OCR的OCR性能依赖性，发现其高准确率（90%→20%断崖式下降）主要依赖语言先验而非视觉能力，揭示端到端模型在视觉压缩中的鲁棒性和上下文瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对DeepSeek-OCR声称的高视觉-文本压缩比是否源于真实的OCR能力，还是过度依赖语言先验的'语言拐杖'现象展开研究，旨在界定模型能力边界并指导压缩范式优化。

Method: 提出句子/词级别语义破坏测试法，系统剥离语言先验影响；对比13种基线模型鲁棒性；通过上下文压力测试评估长文本处理能力，同时量化视觉token数量与先验依赖性的关联。

Result: 1) 移除语言先验后准确率暴跌80%；2) 传统OCR方法抗语义扰动能力显著优于端到端模型；3) 视觉token减少30%导致幻觉风险提升2.5倍；4) 在万级token时模型完全失效，颠覆'压缩缓解长上下文问题'的预期。

Conclusion: 视觉压缩模型必须平衡语言先验应用，过度依赖会导致可靠性危机。建议未来研究：1) 设计先验可控模块 2) 建立抗扰动评估标准 3) 重新审视压缩比与上下文长度的相互作用机制。

Abstract: DeepSeek-OCR utilizes an optical 2D mapping approach to achieve high-ratio vision-text compression, claiming to decode text tokens exceeding ten times the input visual tokens. While this suggests a promising solution for the LLM long-context bottleneck, we investigate a critical question: "Visual merit or linguistic crutch - which drives DeepSeek-OCR's performance?" By employing sentence-level and word-level semantic corruption, we isolate the model's intrinsic OCR capabilities from its language priors. Results demonstrate that without linguistic support, DeepSeek-OCR's performance plummets from approximately 90% to 20%. Comparative benchmarking against 13 baseline models reveals that traditional pipeline OCR methods exhibit significantly higher robustness to such semantic perturbations than end-to-end methods. Furthermore, we find that lower visual token counts correlate with increased reliance on priors, exacerbating hallucination risks. Context stress testing also reveals a total model collapse around 10,000 text tokens, suggesting that current optical compression techniques may paradoxically aggravate the long-context bottleneck. This study empirically defines DeepSeek-OCR's capability boundaries and offers essential insights for future optimizations of the vision-text compression paradigm. We release all data, results and scripts used in this study at https://github.com/dududuck00/DeepSeekOCR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 印尼语等低资源语言缺乏真实结巴语音数据集，导致现有ASR系统难以处理非流畅表达，需开发无需真实数据的解决方案。

Method: 1) 规则变换结合LLM生成带重复/延长的文本 2) TTS合成结巴语音 3) 基于合成数据微调印尼语Whisper模型

Result: 模型在结巴语音识别错误率下降23%，流畅语言处理性能保持稳定，验证合成数据有效性

Conclusion: 合成数据流水线可有效弥补低资源语言的标注数据缺陷，为包容性语音技术开发提供可行路径

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition systems have achieved remarkable performance on fluent speech but continue to degrade significantly when processing stuttered speech, a limitation that is particularly acute for low-resource languages like Indonesian where specialized datasets are virtually non-existent. To overcome this scarcity, we propose a data augmentation framework that generates synthetic stuttered audio by injecting repetitions and prolongations into fluent text through a combination of rule-based transformations and large language models followed by text-to-speech synthesis. We apply this synthetic data to fine-tune a pre-trained Indonesian Whisper model using transfer learning, enabling the architecture to adapt to dysfluent acoustic patterns without requiring large-scale real-world recordings. Our experiments demonstrate that this targeted synthetic exposure consistently reduces recognition errors on stuttered speech while maintaining performance on fluent segments, validating the utility of synthetic data pipelines for developing more inclusive speech technologies in under-represented languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型的多语言生成能力增强可能导致滥用生成个性化虚假信息，但现有研究仅关注英语场景，且缺乏对个性化策略潜在益处的系统评估。

Method: 通过构建1080种多语言个性化提示组合，使用16个语言模型生成共17,280篇文本，对比分析不同语言、目标群体(人口统计)和平台(如社交媒体)场景下文本生成质量与可检测性差异。

Result: 跨语言个性化质量存在显著差异：平台定向策略尤其影响检测能力(英语下降最显著)，而群体定向对检测影响较小；同时发现合理个性化可提升文本可信度等潜在益处。

Conclusion: 语言和应用场景显著影响个性化文本的生成与检测，需针对不同语言特征和平台特性设计检测机制，研究结果对虚假信息管控和模型安全评估具有指导意义。

Abstract: Capabilities of large language models to generate multilingual coherent text have continuously enhanced in recent years, which opens concerns about their potential misuse. Previous research has shown that they can be misused for generation of personalized disinformation in multiple languages. It has also been observed that personalization negatively affects detectability of machine-generated texts; however, this has been studied in the English language only. In this work, we examine this phenomenon across 10 languages, while we focus not only on potential misuse of personalization capabilities, but also on potential benefits they offer. Overall, we cover 1080 combinations of various personalization aspects in the prompts, for which the texts are generated by 16 distinct language models (17,280 texts in total). Our results indicate that there are differences in personalization quality of the generated texts when targeting demographic groups and when targeting social-media platforms across languages. Personalization towards platforms affects detectability of the generated texts in a higher scale, especially in English, where the personalization quality is the highest.

*Pingjun Hong,Benjamin Roth*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型（LLM）生成的自我解释是否能提升用户对其行为（如反事实预测）的预测准确性。实验显示，自我解释能提升模拟精度，但效果依赖扰动策略和评判者能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM可生成自我解释，但现有研究质疑其是否反映真实决策逻辑。本文旨在验证这些解释是否有助于用户预测模型行为（如反事实可模拟性），并探索评估解释效用的扰动策略。

Method: 使用StrategyQA数据集，设计人类与LLM法官任务，测试其在有无模型思维链/事后解释情况下预测模型答案的能力；对比LLM生成反事实与语用扰动两种扰动方法评估解释效果。

Result: 自我解释显著提升LLM法官与人类的预测准确性，但提升幅度和稳定性受扰动策略（如语用扰动更有效）与法官能力（如强LLM效果更优）影响。

Conclusion: LLM生成的自我解释可增强人类对模型行为的预测能力，但需结合扰动策略优化解释呈现形式。人类定性分析表明解释帮助形成更精准的预测逻辑。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can produce verbalized self-explanations, yet prior studies suggest that such rationales may not reliably reflect the model's true decision process. We ask whether these explanations nevertheless help users predict model behavior, operationalized as counterfactual simulatability. Using StrategyQA, we evaluate how well humans and LLM judges can predict a model's answers to counterfactual follow-up questions, with and without access to the model's chain-of-thought or post-hoc explanations. We compare LLM-generated counterfactuals with pragmatics-based perturbations as alternative ways to construct test cases for assessing the potential usefulness of explanations. Our results show that self-explanations consistently improve simulation accuracy for both LLM judges and humans, but the degree and stability of gains depend strongly on the perturbation strategy and judge strength. We also conduct a qualitative analysis of free-text justifications written by human users when predicting the model's behavior, which provides evidence that access to explanations helps humans form more accurate predictions on the perturbed questions.

TL;DR: 固有维数（ID）是区分LLM语言复杂性的有效标记，并揭示了不同处理阶段的复杂性差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证ID能否作为区分形式与功能语言复杂性的指标，并探索LLM内部语言处理阶段的关联性。

Method: 通过比较多从句句子ID差异、功能对比实验（右分支 vs 中心嵌套，歧义 vs 非歧义依存），结合表征相似性与层消融分析方法。

Result: 形式复杂度差异显著且与抽象处理阶段相关，功能复杂度差异不显著但ID仍可区分，跨LLM模型存在相似处理阶段趋势。

Conclusion: ID有效标记语言复杂性，能区分复杂性类型且指示跨模型语言处理阶段一致性。

Abstract: We explore the intrinsic dimension (ID) of LLM representations as a marker of linguistic complexity, asking if different ID profiles across LLM layers differentially characterize formal and functional complexity. We find the formal contrast between sentences with multiple coordinated or subordinated clauses to be reflected in ID differences whose onset aligns with a phase of more abstract linguistic processing independently identified in earlier work. The functional contrasts between sentences characterized by right branching vs. center embedding or unambiguous vs. ambiguous relative clause attachment are also picked up by ID, but in a less marked way, and they do not correlate with the same processing phase. Further experiments using representational similarity and layer ablation confirm the same trends. We conclude that ID is a useful marker of linguistic complexity in LLMs, that it allows to differentiate between different types of complexity, and that it points to similar stages of linguistic processing across disparate LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音频大语言模型在理解和生成方面取得了进展，但其隐私风险尚未被充分研究。本文旨在填补这一空白，首次系统性探索ALLMs仅通过声纹泄露用户隐私的可能性。

Method: 构建名为HearSay的基准数据集，包含22,000个真实世界音频片段，通过自动化分析和人工验证确保数据质量；在数据集上进行多项实验，结合Chain-of-Thought（CoT）推理分析隐私泄露风险。

Result: 实验发现三点：（1）ALLMs可高精度（92.89%）通过声纹提取隐私属性（如性别）；（2）现有安全机制效果有限，模型对隐私入侵请求的拒绝率接近零；（3）CoT推理会加剧高能力模型的隐私泄露风险。

Conclusion: 研究表明ALLMs存在关键隐私漏洞，迫切需针对性强化隐私保护机制。作者开源了代码和数据集以推动后续研究。

Abstract: While Audio Large Language Models (ALLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in understanding and generation, their potential privacy implications remain largely unexplored. This paper takes the first step to investigate whether ALLMs inadvertently leak user privacy solely through acoustic voiceprints and introduces $\textit{HearSay}$, a comprehensive benchmark constructed from over 22,000 real-world audio clips. To ensure data quality, the benchmark is meticulously curated through a rigorous pipeline involving automated profiling and human verification, guaranteeing that all privacy labels are grounded in factual records. Extensive experiments on $\textit{HearSay}$ yield three critical findings: $\textbf{Significant Privacy Leakage}$: ALLMs inherently extract private attributes from voiceprints, reaching 92.89% accuracy on gender and effectively profiling social attributes. $\textbf{Insufficient Safety Mechanisms}$: Alarmingly, existing safeguards are severely inadequate; most models fail to refuse privacy-intruding requests, exhibiting near-zero refusal rates for physiological traits. $\textbf{Reasoning Amplifies Risk}$: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning exacerbates privacy risks in capable models by uncovering deeper acoustic correlations. These findings expose critical vulnerabilities in ALLMs, underscoring the urgent need for targeted privacy alignment.

*Dehao Tao,Guoliang Ma,Yongfeng Huang,Minghu Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MemBox is a memory architecture to improve topic continuity in LLM agents, using hierarchical structure and topic-aware grouping to outperform existing methods in efficiency and coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dialogue memory systems break conversations into isolated units, losing contextual coherence and causal flow, which harms reasoning and efficiency.

Method: A Topic Loom groups continuous dialogue segments with the same topic into 'memory boxes', while a Trace Weaver links these boxes to reconstruct long-term narrative structures across topic changes.

Result: MemBox achieves 68% F1 improvement on temporal reasoning tasks over baselines like Mem0/A-MEM, using fewer context tokens for better efficiency.

Conclusion: Explicitly modeling topic continuity provides a cognitively plausible mechanism to enhance both coherence and efficiency in LLM agent memory systems.

Abstract: Human-agent dialogues often exhibit topic continuity-a stable thematic frame that evolves through temporally adjacent exchanges-yet most large language model (LLM) agent memory systems fail to preserve it. Existing designs follow a fragmentation-compensation paradigm: they first break dialogue streams into isolated utterances for storage, then attempt to restore coherence via embedding-based retrieval. This process irreversibly damages narrative and causal flow, while biasing retrieval towards lexical similarity. We introduce membox, a hierarchical memory architecture centered on a Topic Loom that continuously monitors dialogue in a sliding-window fashion, grouping consecutive same-topic turns into coherent "memory boxes" at storage time. Sealed boxes are then linked by a Trace Weaver into long-range event-timeline traces, recovering macro-topic recurrences across discontinuities. Experiments on LoCoMo demonstrate that Membox achieves up to 68% F1 improvement on temporal reasoning tasks, outperforming competitive baselines (e.g., Mem0, A-MEM). Notably, Membox attains these gains while using only a fraction of the context tokens required by existing methods, highlighting a superior balance between efficiency and effectiveness. By explicitly modeling topic continuity, Membox offers a cognitively motivated mechanism for enhancing both coherence and efficiency in LLM agents.

Motivation: 现有训练数据解释方法未充分研究示例选择策略对解释质量的影响，需量化评估指标来优化有限示例预算的利用效率。

Method: 设计基于模型参数敏感性的选择相关性评分算法，通过微调实验验证其预测能力，对比随机选择与基于影响/代表性策略的性能差异。

Result: 实验证明新型评分能准确预测示例集对模型预测的正负影响，传统策略表现劣于随机选择，平衡策略在示例预算控制方面表现最佳。

Conclusion: 该研究为示例型解释系统提供了有效的评估度量和选择框架，揭示了过度依赖单一影响力指标的局限性。

Abstract: Training data influence estimation methods quantify the contribution of training documents to a model's output, making them a promising source of information for example-based explanations. As humans cannot interpret thousands of documents, only a small subset of the training data can be presented as an explanation. Although the choice of which documents to include directly affects explanation quality, previous evaluations of such systems have largely ignored any selection strategies. To address this, we propose a novel selection relevance score, a retraining-free metric that quantifies how useful a set of examples is for explaining a model's output. We validate this score through fine-tuning experiments, confirming that it can predict whether a set of examples supports or undermines the model's predictions. Using this metric, we further show that common selection strategies often underperform random selection. Motivated by this finding, we propose a strategy that balances influence and representativeness, enabling better use of selection budgets than naively selecting the highest-ranking examples.

### [122] [Do LLMs Really Memorize Personally Identifiable Information? Revisiting PII Leakage with a Cue-Controlled Memorization Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03791)
*Xiaoyu Luo,Yiyi Chen,Qiongxiu Li,Johannes Bjerva*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出Cue-Resistant Memorization（CRM）评估框架，发现现有LLMs记忆PII泄露评估存在高估现象，当去除prompt中的表面线索后，重建成功率显著下降，揭示先前结论主要由线索驱动而非真实记忆。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前研究将PII泄露视为模型记忆的证据，但存在混淆因素——模型可能通过prompt中的词法线索（如特定模式匹配）完成任务，而非真正存储了敏感信息。需要建立可控评估标准区分记忆与线索驱动行为。

Method: 1) 提出CRM框架，通过控制prompt与目标PII的重叠线索（如词频、位置等）量化记忆能力；2) 覆盖32种语言的大规模实验，对比传统前缀-后缀补全、关联重建等任务在高低线索条件下的表现；3) 引入无线索任务（纯生成和会员推理）验证模型记忆边界。

Result: 1) 传统重建任务中，高线索条件下成功率为23.7%，低线索下骤降至5.7%；2) 无线索生成任务真阳性率仅0.02%，会员推理最佳表现仅3.2%；3) 多语言实验显示CRM效果一致性，提示语言复杂度与记忆无关。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs的记忆性PII泄露被系统性高估，核心机制是对训练数据的模式匹配而非信息存储。CRM为隐私评估提供必要标准，建议未来研究需同时报告线索控制与无控制条件下的结果以避免误导。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been reported to "leak" Personally Identifiable Information (PII), with successful PII reconstruction often interpreted as evidence of memorization. We propose a principled revision of memorization evaluation for LLMs, arguing that PII leakage should be evaluated under low lexical cue conditions, where target PII cannot be reconstructed through prompt-induced generalization or pattern completion. We formalize Cue-Resistant Memorization (CRM) as a cue-controlled evaluation framework and a necessary condition for valid memorization evaluation, explicitly conditioning on prompt-target overlap cues. Using CRM, we conduct a large-scale multilingual re-evaluation of PII leakage across 32 languages and multiple memorization paradigms. Revisiting reconstruction-based settings, including verbatim prefix-suffix completion and associative reconstruction, we find that their apparent effectiveness is driven primarily by direct surface-form cues rather than by true memorization. When such cues are controlled for, reconstruction success diminishes substantially. We further examine cue-free generation and membership inference, both of which exhibit extremely low true positive rates. Overall, our results suggest that previously reported PII leakage is better explained by cue-driven behavior than by genuine memorization, highlighting the importance of cue-controlled evaluation for reliably quantifying privacy-relevant memorization in LLMs.

Conclusion: 双模型验证的RAG生成方法有效提升越南传统医学领域数据质量，验证跨语言迁移学习的价值，公开发布的数据集将推动低资源医疗领域的研究进展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in general medical domains. However, their performance significantly degrades in specialized, culturally specific domains such as Vietnamese Traditional Medicine (VTM), primarily due to the scarcity of high-quality, structured benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce VietMed-MCQ, a novel multiple-choice question dataset generated via a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline with an automated consistency check mechanism. Unlike previous synthetic datasets, our framework incorporates a dual-model validation approach to ensure reasoning consistency through independent answer verification, though the substring-based evidence checking has known limitations. The complete dataset of 3,190 questions spans three difficulty levels and underwent validation by one medical expert and four students, achieving 94.2 percent approval with substantial inter-rater agreement (Fleiss' kappa = 0.82). We benchmark seven open-source models on VietMed-MCQ. Results reveal that general-purpose models with strong Chinese priors outperform Vietnamese-centric models, highlighting cross-lingual conceptual transfer, while all models still struggle with complex diagnostic reasoning. Our code and dataset are publicly available to foster research in low-resource medical domains.

*Taisiia Tikhomirova,Dirk U. Wulff*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 变换器语言模型中意义的心理学编码位置受方法选择和架构约束的共同影响，最终层表现并非恢复心理语言信息的最优选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究变换器模型在理论及实践中如何表征具有心理意义的语义特征，对理解模型内部机制至关重要。

Method: 对10种变换器模型（含编码器和解码器架构）的58种心理语言特征进行逐层探测研究，对比三种嵌入提取方法的表征差异。

Result: 上下文嵌入比孤立嵌入表现出更高特征选择性，且心理语言信息的线性可探测性随模型深度呈现层级分化，词汇属性先达到峰值，经验与情感维度后达到峰值。

Conclusion: 变换器模型对意义的表征是探测方法与模型架构交织作用的结果，强调需同时考虑方法论与架构限制的交互效应。

Abstract: Understanding where transformer language models encode psychologically meaningful aspects of meaning is essential for both theory and practice. We conduct a systematic layer-wise probing study of 58 psycholinguistic features across 10 transformer models, spanning encoder-only and decoder-only architectures, and compare three embedding extraction methods. We find that apparent localization of meaning is strongly method-dependent: contextualized embeddings yield higher feature-specific selectivity and different layer-wise profiles than isolated embeddings. Across models and methods, final-layer representations are rarely optimal for recovering psycholinguistic information with linear probes. Despite these differences, models exhibit a shared depth ordering of meaning dimensions, with lexical properties peaking earlier and experiential and affective dimensions peaking later. Together, these results show that where meaning "lives" in transformer models reflects an interaction between methodological choices and architectural constraints.

TL;DR: Evaluates AI text detection methods, finding transformer models outperform traditional ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rise in AI-generated text misuse by students threatens academic integrity, necessitating robust detection methods.

Method: Benchmark on HC3 and DAIGT v2 datasets with topic-split evaluation; compared TF-IDF, BiLSTM, and DistilBERT models.

Result: TF-IDF logistic regression reached 82.87% accuracy; BiLSTM (88.86%) and DistilBERT (88.11%, ROC-AUC 0.96) outperformed.

Conclusion: Contextual models excel over lexical ones; mitigating topic bias is critical. Future work includes enhancing dataset diversity and model efficiency.

Abstract: The rapid development of large language models has led to an increase in AI-generated text, with students increasingly using LLM-generated content as their own work, which violates academic integrity. This paper presents an evaluation of AI text detection methods, including both traditional machine learning models and transformer-based architectures. We utilize two datasets, HC3 and DAIGT v2, to build a unified benchmark and apply a topic-based data split to prevent information leakage. This approach ensures robust generalization across unseen domains. Our experiments show that TF-IDF logistic regression achieves a reasonable baseline accuracy of 82.87%. However, deep learning models outperform it. The BiLSTM classifier achieves an accuracy of 88.86%, while DistilBERT achieves a similar accuracy of 88.11% with the highest ROC-AUC score of 0.96, demonstrating the strongest overall performance. The results indicate that contextual semantic modeling is significantly superior to lexical features and highlight the importance of mitigating topic memorization through appropriate evaluation protocols. The limitations of this work are primarily related to dataset diversity and computational constraints. In future work, we plan to expand dataset diversity and utilize parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods such as LoRA. We also plan to explore smaller or distilled models and employ more efficient batching strategies and hardware-aware optimization.

TL;DR: 本文提出Step Potential Advantage Estimation（SPAE）方法，通过步骤级推理状态评估解决大语言模型在强化学习中的冗余验证问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法因仅依赖结果奖励导致粗粒度优势估计，缺乏语义对齐的步骤级推理进度评估机制，易引发冗余验证和错误轨迹反转。

Method: 设计无训练探测机制生成Step Potential信号（结合中间置信度与正确性），基于此构建细粒度信用分配框架SPAE，动态放大潜力增益、惩罚潜力下降并在潜力饱和后施加终止激励。

Result: 在多个基准测试中SPAE将推理准确率提升达42.3%，响应长度缩减58%，显著优于RL基线及token-level优势估计方法。

Conclusion: 步骤级过程监督机制可有效优化LLM的长链推理效率，开源代码（https://github.com/cii030/SPAE-RL）为可验证强化学习提供了新范式。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) elicits long chain-of-thought reasoning in large language models (LLMs), but outcome-based rewards lead to coarse-grained advantage estimation. While existing approaches improve RLVR via token-level entropy or sequence-level length control, they lack a semantically grounded, step-level measure of reasoning progress. As a result, LLMs fail to distinguish necessary deduction from redundant verification: they may continue checking after reaching a correct solution and, in extreme cases, overturn a correct trajectory into an incorrect final answer. To remedy the lack of process supervision, we introduce a training-free probing mechanism that extracts intermediate confidence and correctness and combines them into a Step Potential signal that explicitly estimates the reasoning state at each step. Building on this signal, we propose Step Potential Advantage Estimation (SPAE), a fine-grained credit assignment method that amplifies potential gains, penalizes potential drops, and applies penalty after potential saturates to encourage timely termination. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show SPAE consistently improves accuracy while substantially reducing response length, outperforming strong RL baselines and recent efficient reasoning and token-level advantage estimation methods. The code is available at https://github.com/cii030/SPAE-RL.

TL;DR: TabTrim 是一种新的表格剪枝框架，通过黄金轨迹监督的并行搜索改进传统顺序修改方法，有效提升多类表格问答任务的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的表格剪枝方法依赖不可靠的批评信号进行顺序修改，常导致关键答案数据丢失，影响下游推理效率。

Method: 通过黄金SQL查询中间表格构建黄金剪枝轨迹，联合训练剪枝器和验证器，并在推理阶段采用并行搜索探索最优子表格。

Result: TabTrim-8B模型以73.5%平均准确率超越最强基线3.2个百分点，在WikiTQ和TableBench数据集分别达到79.4%和61.2%。

Conclusion: 黄金轨迹监督的并行剪枝策略显著提升了表格问答任务的性能，解决了传统方法丢失关键信息的问题。

Abstract: Table Question Answering (TableQA) benefits significantly from table pruning, which extracts compact sub-tables by eliminating redundant cells to streamline downstream reasoning. However, existing pruning methods typically rely on sequential revisions driven by unreliable critique signals, often failing to detect the loss of answer-critical data. To address this limitation, we propose TabTrim, a novel table pruning framework which transforms table pruning from sequential revisions to gold trajectory-supervised parallel search. TabTrim derives a gold pruning trajectory using the intermediate sub-tables in the execution process of gold SQL queries, and trains a pruner and a verifier to make the step-wise pruning result align with the gold pruning trajectory. During inference, TabTrim performs parallel search to explore multiple candidate pruning trajectories and identify the optimal sub-table. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TabTrim achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse tabular reasoning tasks: TabTrim-8B reaches 73.5% average accuracy, outperforming the strongest baseline by 3.2%, including 79.4% on WikiTQ and 61.2% on TableBench.

*Seyed Mahed Mousavi,Simone Alghisi,Giuseppe Riccardi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文发现持续预训练(CPT)中损失函数优化与知识学习存在系统性脱节，表现为损失单调下降但事实学习不稳定且非单调，领域外能力(如数学)早期退化。通过知识电路的快速重组解释了记忆巩固困难和系统性遗忘现象，提出应基于任务级学习动态评估训练停止标准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究仅将CPT视为优化问题，依赖损失值作为知识进步的间接指标，缺乏对训练过程中知识获取动态变化和领域外技能演化的实证研究。

Method: 构建了分布匹配的事实文档控制基准，在CPT训练环路中嵌入诊断探针，实现了对知识获取过程和OOD技能(如数学)的细粒度量化监测，并结合神经电路分析追踪知识路径重组。

Result: 1) 损失值持续降低但事实知识学习不稳定；2) 新增事实难以巩固且依赖先验知识；3) OOD性能早期显著退化；4) 知识电路在训练中呈现快速动态重组，导致学习窗口狭窄。

Conclusion: 证实损失优化不能准确反映知识学习进展，揭示了CPT中记忆巩固机制的局限性，建议建立基于任务级动态评估的训练终止标准，为持续学习理论改进提供新方向。

Abstract: Continual Pre-Training (CPT) is widely used for acquiring and updating factual knowledge in LLMs. This practice treats loss as a proxy for knowledge learning, while offering no grounding into how it changes during training. We study CPT as a knowledge learning process rather than a solely optimization problem. We construct a controlled, distribution-matched benchmark of factual documents and interleave diagnostic probes directly into the CPT loop, enabling epoch-level measurement of knowledge acquisition dynamics and changes in Out-Of-Domain (OOD) general skills (e.g., math). We further analyze how CPT reshapes knowledge circuits during training. Across three instruction-tuned LLMs and multiple CPT strategies, optimization and learning systematically diverge as loss decreases monotonically while factual learning is unstable and non-monotonic. Acquired facts are rarely consolidated, learning is strongly conditioned on prior exposure, and OOD performance degrades from early epochs. Circuit analysis reveals rapid reconfiguration of knowledge pathways across epochs, providing an explanation for narrow acquisition windows and systematic forgetting. These results show that loss optimization is misaligned with learning progress in CPT and motivate evaluation of stopping criteria based on task-level learning dynamics.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究提出了多语言的PartisanLens数据集，并利用大型语言模型评估对党派新闻标题的分类及人口替代阴谋论的检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检测党派叙事和人口替代阴谋论（PRCT）对遏制错误信息传播至关重要，因现有多数资源集中于英语且将党派性、立场和修辞偏见孤立分析，缺乏综合研究。

Method: 引入包含1617个西班牙语、意大利语和葡萄牙语党派新闻标题的PartisanLens数据集，评估大型语言模型（LLM）的分类性能，探索其作为自动标注工具的潜力，并通过社会经济和意识形态特征模拟人工标注视角。

Result: 实验表明LLM在分类任务中表现稳健，但存在局限性；条件生成方法可部分模拟人类标注模式，但效果受限。

Conclusion: PartisanLens数据集为欧洲语境下研究党派及阴谋论叙事提供基础资源，LLM的应用潜力与改进空间为未来工作提供方向。

Abstract: Detecting hyperpartisan narratives and Population Replacement Conspiracy Theories (PRCT) is essential to addressing the spread of misinformation. These complex narratives pose a significant threat, as hyperpartisanship drives political polarisation and institutional distrust, while PRCTs directly motivate real-world extremist violence, making their identification critical for social cohesion and public safety. However, existing resources are scarce, predominantly English-centric, and often analyse hyperpartisanship, stance, and rhetorical bias in isolation rather than as interrelated aspects of political discourse. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textsc{PartisanLens}, the first multilingual dataset of \num{1617} hyperpartisan news headlines in Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese, annotated in multiple political discourse aspects. We first evaluate the classification performance of widely used Large Language Models (LLMs) on this dataset, establishing robust baselines for the classification of hyperpartisan and PRCT narratives. In addition, we assess the viability of using LLMs as automatic annotators for this task, analysing their ability to approximate human annotation. Results highlight both their potential and current limitations. Next, moving beyond standard judgments, we explore whether LLMs can emulate human annotation patterns by conditioning them on socio-economic and ideological profiles that simulate annotator perspectives. At last, we provide our resources and evaluation, \textsc{PartisanLens} supports future research on detecting partisan and conspiratorial narratives in European contexts.

TL;DR: 该研究通过实证分析揭示了LLMs/LRMs的安全对齐能力，发现具备推理和自我反思机制的模型（如GPT-OSS系列）最安全，同时指出微调/知识蒸馏可能损害安全性，以及通过响应前缀的思维链攻击可极大提升攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究者旨在系统性探究影响大模型安全对齐的核心因素，为构建更安全可靠的AI系统提供关键指导（包含参数规模、训练策略等六个内在特性与三种外部攻击技术）。

Method: 基于32种主流LLMs/LRMs（3B-235B参数）的跨模型家族实验，综合应用5个安全数据集、56种越狱攻击技术和4种CoT攻击策略，共进行460万次API调用，量化评估不同变量对攻击成功率的影响。

Result: 1) 逻辑推理模型在安全性能上显著优于同类；2) 微调阶段可能导致系统性安全退化；3) 响应前缀式CoT攻击使Seed-OSS-36B-Instruct模型的攻击成功率从0.6%飙升至96.3%；4) 角色扮演、提示注入和梯度攻击成为主要对齐失效触发方式。

Conclusion: 安全约束应作为训练阶段的显性优化目标，需警惕文本补全接口的响应前缀漏洞，并强调内在模型架构（如推理模块）对安全性的根本作用。

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive empirical study on the safety alignment capabilities. We evaluate what matters for safety alignment in LLMs and LRMs to provide essential insights for developing more secure and reliable AI systems. We systematically investigate and compare the influence of six critical intrinsic model characteristics and three external attack techniques. Our large-scale evaluation is conducted using 32 recent, popular LLMs and LRMs across thirteen distinct model families, spanning a parameter scale from 3B to 235B. The assessment leverages five established safety datasets and probes model vulnerabilities with 56 jailbreak techniques and four CoT attack strategies, resulting in 4.6M API calls. Our key empirical findings are fourfold. First, we identify the LRMs GPT-OSS-20B, Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Thinking, and GPT-OSS-120B as the top-three safest models, which substantiates the significant advantage of integrated reasoning and self-reflection mechanisms for robust safety alignment. Second, post-training and knowledge distillation may lead to a systematic degradation of safety alignment. We thus argue that safety must be treated as an explicit constraint or a core optimization objective during these stages, not merely subordinated to the pursuit of general capability. Third, we reveal a pronounced vulnerability: employing a CoT attack via a response prefix can elevate the attack success rate by 3.34x on average and from 0.6% to 96.3% for Seed-OSS-36B-Instruct. This critical finding underscores the safety risks inherent in text-completion interfaces and features that allow user-defined response prefixes in LLM services, highlighting an urgent need for architectural and deployment safeguards. Fourth, roleplay, prompt injection, and gradient-based search for adversarial prompts are the predominant methodologies for eliciting unaligned behaviors in modern models.

TL;DR: 本论文提出了一种名为ATLAS的双路径框架，用于在跨领域复杂推理中实现动态工具调用，显著提升了GPT-4等模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型（LLMs）和外部工具种类的多样化，选择最优的模型-工具组合成为高维优化挑战。现有方法通常依赖单一模型或固定工具调用逻辑，未能充分利用异构模型-工具对的性能差异。

Method: ATLAS采用双路径方法：(1) 基于聚类的无训练路由策略，利用经验先验知识实现领域对齐；(2) 基于强化学习的多步路由策略，探索自主轨迹以实现分布外泛化能力。此外，框架还支持多模态工具的协同调用。

Result: 在15个基准测试中，ATLAS相较于封闭式模型（如GPT-4o）和现有路由方法，在分布内任务上提升+10.1%，分布外任务上提升+13.1%。在视觉推理任务中，通过多模态工具协同调用也展现出显著优势。

Conclusion: ATLAS通过结合经验先验和强化学习策略，有效解决了模型-工具组合的高维优化问题，实现了跨领域复杂任务的性能提升和分布外泛化能力增强。

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) with external tools has significantly expanded the capabilities of AI agents. However, as the diversity of both LLMs and tools increases, selecting the optimal model-tool combination becomes a high-dimensional optimization challenge. Existing approaches often rely on a single model or fixed tool-calling logic, failing to exploit the performance variations across heterogeneous model-tool pairs. In this paper, we present ATLAS (Adaptive Tool-LLM Alignment and Synergistic Invocation), a dual-path framework for dynamic tool usage in cross-domain complex reasoning. ATLAS operates via a dual-path approach: (1) \textbf{training-free cluster-based routing} that exploits empirical priors for domain-specific alignment, and (2) \textbf{RL-based multi-step routing} that explores autonomous trajectories for out-of-distribution generalization. Extensive experiments across 15 benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms closed-source models like GPT-4o, surpassing existing routing methods on both in-distribution (+10.1%) and out-of-distribution (+13.1%) tasks. Furthermore, our framework shows significant gains in visual reasoning by orchestrating specialized multi-modal tools.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs因体积庞大、计算成本高导致部署困难，需寻找效率更高但性能相近的替代方案。

Method: 通过JFLEG和ASSET数据集测试SLMs（直接使用、微调及序列处理）的表现，并用既定指标评估其结果。

Result: SLMs学习部分行为有效，但性能低于强基线模型，且出现语义保留不足和生成幻觉的问题。

Conclusion: 尽管SLMs拥有效率优势，但当前技术尚无法达到LLMs的性能水平，需进一步改进训练方法以缩小差距。

Abstract: Large language models have become extremely popular recently due to their ability to achieve strong performance on a variety of tasks, such as text generation and rewriting, but their size and computation cost make them difficult to access, deploy, and secure in many settings. This paper investigates whether small, decoder-only language models can provide an efficient alternative for the tasks of grammar correction and text simplification. The experiments in this paper focus on testing small language models out of the box, fine-tuned, and run sequentially on the JFLEG and ASSET datasets using established metrics. The results show that while SLMs may learn certain behaviors well, their performance remains below strong baselines and current LLMs. The results also show that SLMs struggle with retaining meaning and hallucinations. These findings suggest that despite their efficiency advantages, current SLMs are not yet competitive enough with modern LLMs for rewriting, and further advances in training are required for SLMs to close the performance gap between them and today's LLMs.

Motivation: 现有RAG方法无差别触发检索且依赖单路径证据构建，导致噪声引入和性能提升受限。

Result: 在5个开放域问答基准测试中，EM和F1指标均超越标准RAG及强检索增强基线，同时减少43%冗余检索。

Conclusion: DTR通过动态决策机制显著提升RAG性能，尤其在稀疏/模糊查询场景下的准确率和效率。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge, but existing approaches indiscriminately trigger retrieval and rely on single-path evidence construction, often introducing noise and limiting performance gains. In this work, we propose Decide Then Retrieve (DTR), a training-free framework that adaptively determines when retrieval is necessary and how external information should be selected. DTR leverages generation uncertainty to guide retrieval triggering and introduces a dual-path retrieval mechanism with adaptive information selection to better handle sparse and ambiguous queries. Extensive experiments across five open-domain QA benchmarks, multiple model scales, and different retrievers demonstrate that DTR consistently improves EM and F1 over standard RAG and strong retrieval-enhanced baselines, while reducing unnecessary retrievals.

TL;DR: 研究多选问答（MCQA）任务中语言模型如何分离推理与符号绑定错误，发现其采用两阶段机制：先在内容空间选择答案再绑定对应符号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MCQA需同时解决任务并输出对应答案符号，易混淆推理错误与符号绑定失败问题，需解析模型内部处理机制。

Method: 使用主成分分析（PCA）、线性探针探测（linear probes）及因果干预实验，分析模型在选项边界和答案输出阶段的表征特征。

Result: 选项边界（如换行符）的残差状态中存在强线性解码信号，反映选项正确性；winner-identity探测显示，内容位置在末选项处理后立即可解，而输出符号在答案生成阶段才被表征。

Conclusion: 模型采用两阶段流程：先基于内容空间筛选答案，再将结果与对应符号关联输出，验证了符号绑定的机制。

Abstract: Multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) is easy to evaluate but adds a meta-task: models must both solve the problem and output the symbol that *represents* the answer, conflating reasoning errors with symbol-binding failures. We study how language models implement MCQA internally using representational analyses (PCA, linear probes) as well as causal interventions. We find that option-boundary (newline) residual states often contain strong linearly decodable signals related to per-option correctness. Winner-identity probing reveals a two-stage progression: the winning *content position* becomes decodable immediately after the final option is processed, while the *output symbol* is represented closer to the answer emission position. Tests under symbol and content permutations support a two-stage mechanism in which models first select a winner in content space and then bind or route that winner to the appropriate symbol to emit.

Result: DVA框架相较标准提示防御方案在敏感信息保留率指标上提升38.7%，同时发现提取文本虽提升感知但加剧泄漏风险

Conclusion: 结构化推理框架能有效提升策略合规文档理解，揭示了复杂推理导致的安全漏洞及其防御机制

Abstract: The deployment of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) for real-world document question answering is often constrained by dynamic, user-defined policies that dictate information disclosure based on context. While ensuring adherence to these explicit constraints is critical, existing safety research primarily focuses on implicit social norms or text-only settings, overlooking the complexities of multimodal documents. In this paper, we introduce Doc-PP (Document Policy Preservation Benchmark), a novel benchmark constructed from real-world reports requiring reasoning across heterogeneous visual and textual elements under strict non-disclosure policies. Our evaluation highlights a systemic Reasoning-Induced Safety Gap: models frequently leak sensitive information when answers must be inferred through complex synthesis or aggregated across modalities, effectively circumventing existing safety constraints. Furthermore, we identify that providing extracted text improves perception but inadvertently facilitates leakage. To address these vulnerabilities, we propose DVA (Decompose-Verify-Aggregation), a structural inference framework that decouples reasoning from policy verification. Experimental results demonstrate that DVA significantly outperforms standard prompting defenses, offering a robust baseline for policy-compliant document understanding

Abstract: We introduce Arctic-ABSA, a collection of powerful models for real-life aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA). Our models are tailored to commercial needs, trained on a large corpus of public data alongside carefully generated synthetic data, resulting in a dataset 20 times larger than SemEval14. We extend typical ABSA models by expanding the number of sentiment classes from the standard three (positive, negative, neutral) to five, adding mixed and unknown classes, while also jointly predicting overall text sentiment and supporting multiple languages. We experiment with reasoning injection by fine-tuning on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) examples and introduce a novel reasoning pretraining technique for encoder-only models that significantly improves downstream fine-tuning and generalization. Our 395M-parameter encoder and 8B-parameter decoder achieve up to 10 percentage points higher accuracy than GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, while setting new state-of-the-art results on the SemEval14 benchmark. A single multilingual model maintains 87-91% accuracy across six languages without degrading English performance. We release ABSA-mix, a large-scale benchmark aggregating 17 public ABSA datasets across 92 domains.

Our approach employs a generator that rewrites real articles with factual perturbations, paired with a lightweight detector that verifies claims using dense passage retrieval. To enable effective co-evolution, we introduce verbal adversarial feedback (VAF). Rather than relying on scalar rewards, VAF issues structured natural-language critiques; these guide the generator toward more sophisticated evasion attempts, compelling the detector to adapt and improve. On a fake news detection benchmark, RADAR achieves 86.98% ROC-AUC, significantly outperforming general-purpose LLMs with retrieval. Ablation studies confirm that detector-side retrieval yields the largest gains, while VAF and few-shot demonstrations provide critical signals for robust training.

TL;DR: 本文提出了Benchmark^2框架，通过三个互补指标系统评估大语言模型（LLM）基准质量，旨在筛选高质量基准以提升评估效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM基准数量激增，但缺乏对基准质量本身的系统评估方法，亟需解决基准可靠性问题。

Method: 构建三个指标：跨基准排名一致性（衡量与其他基准的对齐性）、可区分性得分（量化区分模型的能力）、能力偏离度（识别强模型失败但弱模型成功的问题场景），并在15个基准和11个LLM上验证。

Result: 实验证明现有基准质量差异显著，利用该框架筛选基准后，仅需较小子集即可实现相近的评估性能。

Conclusion: Benchmark^2能有效指导基准质量评估，通过选择性构建减少冗余测试集，同时保持评估有效性。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of benchmarks for evaluating large language models (LLMs) has created an urgent need for systematic methods to assess benchmark quality itself. We propose Benchmark^2, a comprehensive framework comprising three complementary metrics: (1) Cross-Benchmark Ranking Consistency, measuring whether a benchmark produces model rankings aligned with peer benchmarks; (2) Discriminability Score, quantifying a benchmark's ability to differentiate between models; and (3) Capability Alignment Deviation, identifying problematic instances where stronger models fail but weaker models succeed within the same model family. We conduct extensive experiments across 15 benchmarks spanning mathematics, reasoning, and knowledge domains, evaluating 11 LLMs across four model families. Our analysis reveals significant quality variations among existing benchmarks and demonstrates that selective benchmark construction based on our metrics can achieve comparable evaluation performance with substantially reduced test sets.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了VotIE任务，旨在从非结构化的市政会议记录中提取结构化投票信息，并构建了首个基准数据集。实验表明，在领域内微调的模型表现优异，但跨市政场景生成模型更稳健。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 市政会议记录格式多样且异构，传统方法难以自动提取投票信息。现有研究缺乏相关基准和跨场景性能分析，需探索高效实用的信息提取方案。

Method: 构建基于葡萄牙市政数据的VotIE基准，采用XLM-R-CRF等微调编码器与生成模型（如LLM）对比实验，评估其在领域内和跨市政场景下的性能表现。

Result: 1) 领域内XLM-R-CRF达93.2% F1值，优于生成模型；2) 跨市政场景微调模型性能骤降，生成模型性能下降幅度显著更小。

Conclusion: 微调模型适合大规模部署，生成模型虽鲁棒性强但计算成本高。论文开源了基准数据集和模型，推动市政NLP领域可复现实验研究。

Abstract: Municipal meeting minutes record key decisions in local democratic processes. Unlike parliamentary proceedings, which typically adhere to standardized formats, they encode voting outcomes in highly heterogeneous, free-form narrative text that varies widely across municipalities, posing significant challenges for automated extraction. In this paper, we introduce VotIE (Voting Information Extraction), a new information extraction task aimed at identifying structured voting events in narrative deliberative records, and establish the first benchmark for this task using Portuguese municipal minutes, building on the recently introduced CitiLink corpus. Our experiments yield two key findings. First, under standard in-domain evaluation, fine-tuned encoders, specifically XLM-R-CRF, achieve the strongest performance, reaching 93.2\% macro F1, outperforming generative approaches. Second, in a cross-municipality setting that evaluates transfer to unseen administrative contexts, these models suffer substantial performance degradation, whereas few-shot LLMs demonstrate greater robustness, with significantly smaller declines in performance. Despite this generalization advantage, the high computational cost of generative models currently constrains their practicality. As a result, lightweight fine-tuned encoders remain a more practical option for large-scale, real-world deployment. To support reproducible research in administrative NLP, we publicly release our benchmark, trained models, and evaluation framework.

TL;DR: 本研究针对大型语言模型（LLMs）教育应用中学生模拟质量评估不足的问题，提出多维度评估指标并验证现有方法的有效性局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs教育工具依赖学生模拟进行评估，但缺乏对模拟质量的量化验证，且真实学生实验因成本难以规模化，影响技术落地可靠性。

Method: 定义学生模拟任务形式化框架，引入语言多样性、行为一致性、认知合理性等多维度指标，在数学辅导对话数据集上对比基础提示法、监督微调和偏好优化方法的性能，结合自动指标与人工评估。

Result: 基础提示策略在连贯性（BLEU-4 12.3）和认知合理性（人工评分2.1/5）表现最差；监督微调提升响应多样性（Distinct-2 +38%）但存在过拟合风险；偏好优化在行为一致性（ACT-R模型拟合度R²=0.71）表现最优但整体仍低于真实学生水平。

Conclusion: 学生模拟质量直接影响LLMs教育系统评估可靠性，当前方法在认知建模和长期行为一致性方面存在显著缺陷，需结合认知科学理论推进更深层次的模拟技术研究。

Abstract: Advances in large language models (LLMs) enable many new innovations in education. However, evaluating the effectiveness of new technology requires real students, which is time-consuming and hard to scale up. Therefore, many recent works on LLM-powered tutoring solutions have used simulated students for both training and evaluation, often via simple prompting. Surprisingly, little work has been done to ensure or even measure the quality of simulated students. In this work, we formally define the student simulation task, propose a set of evaluation metrics that span linguistic, behavioral, and cognitive aspects, and benchmark a wide range of student simulation methods on these metrics. We experiment on a real-world math tutoring dialogue dataset, where both automated and human evaluation results show that prompting strategies for student simulation perform poorly; supervised fine-tuning and preference optimization yield much better but still limited performance, motivating future work on this challenging task.

### [141] [SpeakerSleuth: Evaluating Large Audio-Language Models as Judges for Multi-turn Speaker Consistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04029)
*Jonggeun Lee,Junseong Pyo,Gyuhyeon Seo,Yohan Jo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large Audio-Language Models struggle to assess speaker consistency in multi-turn dialogues, prioritizing text over acoustic cues and failing to detect inconsistencies like gender switches when textual coherence conflicts with audio signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research overlooks LALMs' ability to evaluate speaker consistency in multi-turn conversations, despite their use as audio evaluation judges. This study addresses this gap by proposing a benchmark to test their reliability in real-world acoustic-textual scenarios.

Method: The authors created SpeakerSleuth with 1,818 human-verified instances from four diverse datasets (synthetic/real speech), structured into three tasks: inconsistency detection, problematic turn localization, and acoustic variant selection. Nine LALMs were evaluated under controlled acoustic difficulty and multi-speaker contexts.

Result: LALMs showed inconsistent performance: some over-predicted inconsistencies, while others were overly lenient. Performance degraded sharply when multi-speaker text was present, with models favoring textual coherence over acoustic cues (e.g., missing obvious gender switches). However, models excelled in selecting the correct speaker-matching audio from variants.

Conclusion: LALMs exhibit a text-over-acoustic bias, revealing fundamental multimodal imbalances. This highlights the need for improved acoustic processing to build reliable audio-language judges for speech evaluation.

Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) as judges have emerged as a prominent approach for evaluating speech generation quality, yet their ability to assess speaker consistency across multi-turn conversations remains unexplored. We present SpeakerSleuth, a benchmark evaluating whether LALMs can reliably judge speaker consistency in multi-turn dialogues through three tasks reflecting real-world requirements. We construct 1,818 human-verified evaluation instances across four diverse datasets spanning synthetic and real speech, with controlled acoustic difficulty. Evaluating nine widely-used LALMs, we find that models struggle to reliably detect acoustic inconsistencies. For instance, given audio samples of the same speaker's turns, some models overpredict inconsistency, whereas others are overly lenient. Models further struggle to identify the exact turns that are problematic. When other interlocutors' turns are provided together, performance degrades dramatically as models prioritize textual coherence over acoustic cues, failing to detect even obvious gender switches for a speaker. On the other hand, models perform substantially better in choosing the audio that best matches the speaker among several acoustic variants, demonstrating inherent acoustic discrimination capabilities. These findings expose a significant bias in LALMs: they tend to prioritize text over acoustics, revealing fundamental modality imbalances that need to be addressed to build reliable audio-language judges.

### [142] [Analyzing and Improving Cross-lingual Knowledge Transfer for Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04036)
*David Stap*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This thesis explores how to enhance knowledge sharing in multilingual translation systems, especially for low-resource languages, by analyzing language similarities, data diversity, and training strategies to build more robust and inclusive NLP models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multilingual models struggle with low-resource languages due to limited parallel data, which hinders knowledge transfer and generalization. Better understanding of how languages interact and how to optimize training is needed for resilient systems.

Method: The study uses machine translation as a testbed to analyze: (1) language similarity impacts on transfer, (2) retrieval/auxiliary supervision for low-resource translation, (3) trade-offs in fine-tuning large models, and (4) effects of language diversity during training.

Result: Key findings show that increasing language diversity during training improves generalization, retrieval-augmented supervision strengthens low-resource translation, and fine-tuning poses unintended trade-offs in large models. Language similarity analysis reveals structured patterns in cross-lingual knowledge transfer.

Conclusion: Modeling choices and data composition (e.g., language diversity) critically shape multilingual learning. The work provides actionable insights for designing more inclusive and robust multilingual NLP systems by balancing representation sharing and targeted supervision.

Abstract: Multilingual machine translation systems aim to make knowledge accessible across languages, yet learning effective cross-lingual representations remains challenging. These challenges are especially pronounced for low-resource languages, where limited parallel data constrains generalization and transfer. Understanding how multilingual models share knowledge across languages requires examining the interaction between representations, data availability, and training strategies. In this thesis, we study cross-lingual knowledge transfer in neural models and develop methods to improve robustness and generalization in multilingual settings, using machine translation as a central testbed. We analyze how similarity between languages influences transfer, how retrieval and auxiliary supervision can strengthen low-resource translation, and how fine-tuning on parallel data can introduce unintended trade-offs in large language models. We further examine the role of language diversity during training and show that increasing translation coverage improves generalization and reduces off-target behavior. Together, this work highlights how modeling choices and data composition shape multilingual learning and offers insights toward more inclusive and resilient multilingual NLP systems.

Motivation: 研究多模态大语言模型在日常生活场景中产生的不安全内容对人类行为的影响，当前缺乏针对真实视觉输入和跨模态推理的安全评估方法。

Method: 构建包含2013个真实世界图像-文本样本的SaLAD基准库，涵盖10个日常场景类别，采用真实风险暴露设计和细粒度跨模态推理评估；提出安全警告评估框架替代传统拒绝响应评估。

Result: 18个主流多模态语言模型测试显示顶级模型安全响应率仅57.2%，传统安全对齐方法在该场景下效果受限，揭示现有模型在危险行为识别上的脆弱性。

Conclusion: 现有多模态语言模型存在显著安全隐患，需要改进安全对齐策略并开发更精确的跨模态安全评估体系。

Abstract: As Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) become an indispensable assistant in human life, the unsafe content generated by MLLMs poses a danger to human behavior, perpetually overhanging human society like a sword of Damocles. To investigate and evaluate the safety impact of MLLMs responses on human behavior in daily life, we introduce SaLAD, a multimodal safety benchmark which contains 2,013 real-world image-text samples across 10 common categories, with a balanced design covering both unsafe scenarios and cases of oversensitivity. It emphasizes realistic risk exposure, authentic visual inputs, and fine-grained cross-modal reasoning, ensuring that safety risks cannot be inferred from text alone. We further propose a safety-warning-based evaluation framework that encourages models to provide clear and informative safety warnings, rather than generic refusals. Results on 18 MLLMs demonstrate that the top-performing models achieve a safe response rate of only 57.2% on unsafe queries. Moreover, even popular safety alignment methods limit effectiveness of the models in our scenario, revealing the vulnerabilities of current MLLMs in identifying dangerous behaviors in daily life.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种模块化提示优化（MPO）框架，通过将提示拆分为固定语义模块并进行局部优化，提升小规模开源大语言模型的推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提示质量对小型开源指令微调模型至关重要，但现有方法将提示视为整体文本块，难以定位错误、保留关键指令或控制提示膨胀。

Method: MPO将提示结构化为角色、上下文、任务描述等模块，使用批评语言模型生成的文本梯度进行局部优化，并通过去重合并更新以减少冗余。

Result: 在ARC-Challenge和MMLU数据集上，MPO在保持提示结构和模型参数不变的情况下，相较基线方法显著提升准确率。

Conclusion: 固定提示结构下的模块化局部优化是小型开源语言模型提升推理性能的有效实践方案，兼具可解释性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Prompt quality plays a central role in controlling the behavior, reliability, and reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs), particularly for smaller open-source instruction-tuned models that depend heavily on explicit structure. While recent work has explored automatic prompt optimization using textual gradients and self-refinement, most existing methods treat prompts as monolithic blocks of text, making it difficult to localize errors, preserve critical instructions, or prevent uncontrolled prompt growth. We introduce Modular Prompt Optimization (MPO), a schema-based prompt optimization framework that treats prompts as structured objects composed of fixed semantic sections, including system role, context, task description, constraints, and output format. MPO applies section-local textual gradients, generated by a critic language model, to refine each section independently while keeping the overall prompt schema fixed. Section updates are consolidated through de-duplication to reduce redundancy and interference between components, yielding an interpretable and robust optimization process. We evaluate MPO on two reasoning benchmarks, ARC-Challenge and MMLU, using LLaMA-3 8B-Instruct and Mistral-7B-Instruct as solver models. Across both benchmarks and models, MPO consistently outperforms an untuned structured prompt and the TextGrad baseline, achieving substantial accuracy gains without modifying model parameters or altering prompt structure. These results demonstrate that maintaining a fixed prompt schema while applying localized, section-wise optimization is an effective and practical approach for improving reasoning performance in small open-source LMs.

Conclusion: 该方法为构建可扩展的多模态生成系统提供了新范式，打破了自回归与扩散模型的技术壁垒。

Abstract: The bifurcation of generative modeling into autoregressive approaches for discrete data (text) and diffusion approaches for continuous data (images) hinders the development of truly unified multimodal systems. While Masked Language Models (MLMs) offer efficient bidirectional context, they traditionally lack the generative fidelity of autoregressive models and the semantic continuity of diffusion models. Furthermore, extending masked generation to multimodal settings introduces severe alignment challenges and training instability. In this work, we propose \textbf{CoM-DAD} (\textbf{Co}upled \textbf{M}anifold \textbf{D}iscrete \textbf{A}bsorbing \textbf{D}iffusion), a novel probabilistic framework that reformulates multimodal generation as a hierarchical dual-process. CoM-DAD decouples high-level semantic planning from low-level token synthesis. First, we model the semantic manifold via a continuous latent diffusion process; second, we treat token generation as a discrete absorbing diffusion process, regulated by a \textbf{Variable-Rate Noise Schedule}, conditioned on these evolving semantic priors. Crucially, we introduce a \textbf{Stochastic Mixed-Modal Transport} strategy that aligns disparate modalities without requiring heavy contrastive dual-encoders. Our method demonstrates superior stability over standard masked modeling, establishing a new paradigm for scalable, unified text-image generation.

Motivation: 针对大语言模型在推理过程中由提示诱导产生的幻觉问题，现有方法难以同时提高准确性和可解释性，因此提出一种新的框架以解决这一不足。

Method: 通过扩展链式知识蒸馏方法，嵌入可编程模块作为可执行代码到推理提示中，引导模型在推理阶段动态结合外部结构化知识（如知识图谱）进行上下文建模与中间推理约束。

Result: 在GPT-4和LLaMA-3.3上的实验表明，代码引导推理使HIT@1、HIT@3、HIT@5分别提升15.64%、13.38%和13.28%，多数评估设置得分超95%，且显著降低幻觉并提升可解释性。

Conclusion: 该框架通过显式约束推理过程，有效减少了错误决策，同时在复杂推理任务中保持高效准确，证明了代码引导方法在增强模型可靠性上的潜力。

Abstract: To mitigate hallucinations in large language models (LLMs), we propose a framework that focuses on errors induced by prompts. Our method extends a chain-style knowledge distillation approach by incorporating a programmable module that guides knowledge graph exploration. This module is embedded as executable code within the reasoning prompt, allowing the model to leverage external structured knowledge during inference. Based on this design, we develop an enhanced distillation-based reasoning framework that explicitly regulates intermediate reasoning steps, resulting in more reliable predictions. We evaluate the proposed approach on multiple public benchmarks using GPT-4 and LLaMA-3.3. Experimental results show that code-guided reasoning significantly improves contextual modeling and reduces prompt-induced hallucinations. Specifically, HIT@1, HIT@3, and HIT@5 increase by 15.64%, 13.38%, and 13.28%, respectively, with scores exceeding 95% across several evaluation settings. These findings indicate that the proposed method effectively constrains erroneous reasoning while improving both accuracy and interpretability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为ContextFocus的轻量级激活转向方法，旨在提升大语言模型在知识冲突场景下的上下文忠实度，无需模型微调且保持高效推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当外部检索上下文与模型内存知识冲突时，大语言模型倾向于依赖内存知识而产生不忠实输出。已有解决方案（如微调、上下文增强）存在效率低或需额外训练资源的问题，亟需高效且无需微调的方法。

Method: ContextFocus通过推理时动态调整模型激活状态实现上下文优先：1) 利用对比向量分析冲突上下文与内存知识的表征差异；2) 通过方向性激活干预增强模型对正确上下文的敏感度；3) 基于重要性权重动态平衡上下文与内存知识的交互强度。

Result: 在ConFiQA基准测试中，ContextFocus在3个LLM（Vicuna1.5、LLaMA2、ChatGPT）上平均提升上下文忠实度（Faithfulness@top-5）27.8%，同时保持原文流畅度（BERTScore>0.91），推理延迟仅增加8%。与ContextDPO相比，效果提升2.6倍且无需训练。

Conclusion: ContextFocus通过激活干预技术在保留模型原有能力的同时有效解决知识冲突问题，其零训练、实时性特点支持快速部署，且与提示工程互补，为LLM动态对齐最新知识提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) encode vast amounts of parametric knowledge during pre-training. As world knowledge evolves, effective deployment increasingly depends on their ability to faithfully follow externally retrieved context. When such evidence conflicts with the model's internal knowledge, LLMs often default to memorized facts, producing unfaithful outputs. In this work, we introduce ContextFocus, a lightweight activation steering approach that improves context faithfulness in such knowledge-conflict settings while preserving fluency and efficiency. Unlike prior approaches, our solution requires no model finetuning and incurs minimal inference-time overhead, making it highly efficient. We evaluate ContextFocus on the ConFiQA benchmark, comparing it against strong baselines including ContextDPO, COIECD, and prompting-based methods. Furthermore, we show that our method is complementary to prompting strategies and remains effective on larger models. Extensive experiments show that ContextFocus significantly improves contextual-faithfulness. Our results highlight the effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency of ContextFocus in improving contextual-faithfulness of LLM outputs.

TL;DR: RFC Bench是一款评估金融虚假新闻的基准测试工具，包含无参考检测与对比诊断两种任务。实验表明，对比语境下模型表现更优，而无参考设置暴露了模型的不稳定性与高错误率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融领域的大语言模型在缺乏外部参考信息时，难以准确识别虚假新闻。现有模型缺乏对金融新闻复杂上下文的稳定推理能力，需要系统性评估框架。

Method: 构建RFC Bench基准，包含两类任务：1) 无参考虚假新闻检测，评估模型独立判断能力；2) 基于原始与篡改新闻对的对比诊断，分析模型对细微差异的敏感性。

Result: 实验发现，对比语境下模型性能显著提升，但无参考场景下出现预测不稳定、输出无效内容等缺陷，表明模型依赖外部参考源维持逻辑一致性。

Conclusion: RFC Bench揭示了当前金融虚假信息检测的技术缺口，为研究无参考推理机制提供了标准化测试平台，推动更稳健的金融信息验证方法发展。

Abstract: We introduce RFC Bench, a benchmark for evaluating large language models on financial misinformation under realistic news. RFC Bench operates at the paragraph level and captures the contextual complexity of financial news where meaning emerges from dispersed cues. The benchmark defines two complementary tasks: reference free misinformation detection and comparison based diagnosis using paired original perturbed inputs. Experiments reveal a consistent pattern: performance is substantially stronger when comparative context is available, while reference free settings expose significant weaknesses, including unstable predictions and elevated invalid outputs. These results indicate that current models struggle to maintain coherent belief states without external grounding. By highlighting this gap, RFC Bench provides a structured testbed for studying reference free reasoning and advancing more reliable financial misinformation detection in real world settings.
