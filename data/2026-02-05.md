Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become a mainstream representation for real-time 3D scene synthesis, enabling applications in virtual and augmented reality, robotics, and 3D content creation. Its rising commercial value and explicit parametric structure raise emerging intellectual property (IP) protection concerns, prompting a surge of research on 3DGS IP protection. However, current progress remains fragmented, lacking a unified view of the underlying mechanisms, protection paradigms, and robustness challenges. To address this gap, we present the first systematic survey on 3DGS IP protection and introduce a bottom-up framework that examines (i) underlying Gaussian-based perturbation mechanisms, (ii) passive and active protection paradigms, and (iii) robustness threats under emerging generative AI era, revealing gaps in technical foundations and robustness characterization and indicating opportunities for deeper investigation. Finally, we outline six research directions across robustness, efficiency, and protection paradigms, offering a roadmap toward reliable and trustworthy IP protection for 3DGS assets.

Abstract: Point clouds provide a compact and expressive representation of 3D objects, and have recently been integrated into multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, existing methods primarily focus on static objects, while understanding dynamic point cloud sequences remains largely unexplored. This limitation is mainly caused by the lack of large-scale cross-modal datasets and the difficulty of modeling motions in spatio-temporal contexts. To bridge this gap, we present 4DPC$^2$hat, the first MLLM tailored for dynamic point cloud understanding. To this end, we construct a large-scale cross-modal dataset 4DPC$^2$hat-200K via a meticulous two-stage pipeline consisting of topology-consistent 4D point construction and two-level captioning. The dataset contains over 44K dynamic object sequences, 700K point cloud frames, and 200K curated question-answer (QA) pairs, supporting inquiries about counting, temporal relationship, action, spatial relationship, and appearance. At the core of the framework, we introduce a Mamba-enhanced temporal reasoning MLLM to capture long-range dependencies and dynamic patterns among a point cloud sequence. Furthermore, we propose a failure-aware bootstrapping learning strategy that iteratively identifies model deficiencies and generates targeted QA supervision to continuously strengthen corresponding reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our 4DPC$^2$hat significantly improves action understanding and temporal reasoning compared with existing models, establishing a strong foundation for 4D dynamic point cloud understanding.

Abstract: Language-referred audio-visual segmentation (Ref-AVS) aims to segment target objects described by natural language by jointly reasoning over video, audio, and text. Beyond generating segmentation masks, providing rich and interpretable diagnoses of mask quality remains largely underexplored. In this work, we introduce Mask Quality Assessment in the Ref-AVS context (MQA-RefAVS), a new task that evaluates the quality of candidate segmentation masks without relying on ground-truth annotations as references at inference time. Given audio-visual-language inputs and each provided segmentation mask, the task requires estimating its IoU with the unobserved ground truth, identifying the corresponding error type, and recommending an actionable quality-control decision. To support this task, we construct MQ-RAVSBench, a benchmark featuring diverse and representative mask error modes that span both geometric and semantic issues. We further propose MQ-Auditor, a multimodal large language model (MLLM)-based auditor that explicitly reasons over multimodal cues and mask information to produce quantitative and qualitative mask quality assessments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MQ-Auditor outperforms strong open-source and commercial MLLMs and can be integrated with existing Ref-AVS systems to detect segmentation failures and support downstream segmentation improvement. Data and codes will be released at https://github.com/jasongief/MQA-RefAVS.

### [4] [GPAIR: Gaussian-Kernel-Based Ultrafast 3D Photoacoustic Iterative Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03893)
*Yibing Wang,Shuang Li,Tingting Huang,Yu Zhang,Chulhong Kim,Seongwook Choi,Changhui Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GPAIR, an ultrafast iterative reconstruction method for 3D photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) that accelerates reconstruction speeds by orders of magnitude using Gaussian kernels and GPU-accelerated computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithms in 3D PACT suffer from excessive computational time (hundreds of seconds to hours), limiting practical applications. A solution is needed to drastically reduce reconstruction time while maintaining artifact correction capabilities.

Method: GPAIR employs continuous isotropic Gaussian kernels to replace traditional spatial grids, derives analytical closed-form expressions for pressure waves, and utilizes GPU-accelerated differentiable Triton operators for efficient computation.

Result: GPAIR achieves sub-second reconstruction speed for 3D targets with 8.4 million voxels (tested in animal experiments), demonstrating an orders-of-magnitude acceleration compared to conventional IR methods.

Conclusion: This ultrafast reconstruction enables near-real-time large-scale 3D photoacoustic imaging, potentially advancing clinical translation of PACT technology.

Abstract: Although the iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithm can substantially correct reconstruction artifacts in photoacoustic (PA) computed tomography (PACT), it suffers from long reconstruction times, especially for large-scale three-dimensional (3D) imaging in which IR takes hundreds of seconds to hours. The computing burden severely limits the practical applicability of IR algorithms. In this work, we proposed an ultrafast IR method for 3D PACT, called Gaussian-kernel-based Ultrafast 3D Photoacoustic Iterative Reconstruction (GPAIR), which achieves orders-of-magnitude acceleration in computing. GPAIR transforms traditional spatial grids with continuous isotropic Gaussian kernels. By deriving analytical closed-form expression for pressure waves and implementing powerful GPU-accelerated differentiable Triton operators, GPAIR demonstrates extraordinary ultrafast sub-second reconstruction speed for 3D targets containing 8.4 million voxels in animal experiments. This revolutionary ultrafast image reconstruction enables near-real-time large-scale 3D PA reconstruction, significantly advancing 3D PACT toward clinical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工标注动物图像仍是生态研究中的重大瓶颈，本文旨在探索利用Vision Transformer基础模型将大规模未标注动物图像直接聚类到物种级别以提升监测效率。

Method: 构建包含5种ViT模型、5种降维技术和4种聚类算法的基准框架，使用60个物种（各200张验证图像）进行测试，结合监督/无监督方法评估聚类效果，验证通过过度聚类提取种内生态特征。

Result: DINOv3嵌入结合t-SNE和监督分层聚类实现近完美物种级聚类（V-measure 0.958），无监督方法虽无需先验知识但性能仅降低至0.943，仅1.14%图像被标记为异常值。过度聚类成功揭示年龄分异、性二型和毛色差异等生态特征。

Conclusion: 提出开源基准工具包并为生态学家提供方法选择建议，证明该框架可稳定处理物种长尾分布，且能自动提取种内变异特征，显著减少专家审查工作量。

Abstract: Manual labeling of animal images remains a significant bottleneck in ecological research, limiting the scale and efficiency of biodiversity monitoring efforts. This study investigates whether state-of-the-art Vision Transformer (ViT) foundation models can reduce thousands of unlabeled animal images directly to species-level clusters. We present a comprehensive benchmarking framework evaluating five ViT models combined with five dimensionality reduction techniques and four clustering algorithms, two supervised and two unsupervised, across 60 species (30 mammals and 30 birds), with each test using a random subset of 200 validated images per species. We investigate when clustering succeeds at species-level, where it fails, and whether clustering within the species-level reveals ecologically meaningful patterns such as sex, age, or phenotypic variation. Our results demonstrate near-perfect species-level clustering (V-measure: 0.958) using DINOv3 embeddings with t-SNE and supervised hierarchical clustering methods. Unsupervised approaches achieve competitive performance (0.943) while requiring no prior species knowledge, rejecting only 1.14% of images as outliers requiring expert review. We further demonstrate robustness to realistic long-tailed distributions of species and show that intentional over-clustering can reliably extract intra-specific variation including age classes, sexual dimorphism, and pelage differences. We introduce an open-source benchmarking toolkit and provide recommendations for ecologists to select appropriate methods for sorting their specific taxonomic groups and data.

### [6] [Benchmarking Bias Mitigation Toward Fairness Without Harm from Vision to LVLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03895)
*Xuwei Tan,Ziyu Hu,Xueru Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本论文提出NH-Fair基准测试平台，通过标准化数据、指标与训练协议，系统评估视觉及多模态模型的公平性，发现数据增强与调参策略在平衡准确率与公平性上的关键作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前公平性方法比较存在数据异质性、指标不统一、模型类型覆盖不足及调参不充分的问题，需建立统一基准以进行可靠评估。

Method: 构建标准化评估框架NH-Fair，包含系统性的ERM调参研究、复合数据增强方法对比、LVLMs与单一视觉模型的性能分析，并提供可复现的调参敏感评估流程。

Result: ①ERM调参可缩小超参数空间并平衡准确率与公平性；②复合数据增强稳定提升公平性，优于多数去偏方法；③LVLMs虽准确率高但存在子组差异，模型扩展效果弱于架构/训练优化。

Conclusion: NH-Fair为模型公平性评估提供了可复现、调参敏感且覆盖广泛模型类型的系统工具，强调实践中的调参重要性与数据增强策略优先级。

Abstract: Machine learning models trained on real-world data often inherit and amplify biases against certain social groups, raising urgent concerns about their deployment at scale. While numerous bias mitigation methods have been proposed, comparing the effectiveness of bias mitigation methods remains difficult due to heterogeneous datasets, inconsistent fairness metrics, isolated evaluation of vision versus multi-modal models, and insufficient hyperparameter tuning that undermines fair comparisons. We introduce NH-Fair, a unified benchmark for fairness without harm that spans both vision models and large vision-language models (LVLMs) under standardized data, metrics, and training protocols, covering supervised and zero-shot regimes. Our key contributions are: (1) a systematic ERM tuning study that identifies training choices with large influence on both utility and disparities, yielding empirically grounded guidelines to help practitioners reduce expensive hyperparameter tuning space in achieving strong fairness and accuracy; (2) evidence that many debiasing methods do not reliably outperform a well-tuned ERM baseline, whereas a composite data-augmentation method consistently delivers parity gains without sacrificing utility, emerging as a promising practical strategy. (3) an analysis showing that while LVLMs achieve higher average accuracy, they still exhibit subgroup disparities, and gains from scaling are typically smaller than those from architectural or training-protocol choices. NH-Fair provides a reproducible, tuning-aware pipeline for rigorous, harm-aware fairness evaluation.

*Qiuming Luo,Tao Zeng,Feng Li,Heming Liu,Rui Mao,Chang Kong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于信息熵与结构对齐的手写汉字零样本识别方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽略汉字部首层次结构与信息密度差异，导致识别效果受限

Method: 1. 引入信息熵先验调制位置嵌入以捕捉关键部首
2. 双视角部首树提取多粒度结构特征
3. Top-K语义特征融合机制增强解码过程

Result: 超越CLIP基线方法，在零样本设定下取得SOTA；少量样本即可快速适配

Conclusion: 结构感知与熵调控机制有效提升汉字识别的泛化性和数据效率

Abstract: Zero-shot Handwritten Chinese Character Recognition (HCCR) aims to recognize unseen characters by leveraging radical-based semantic compositions. However, existing approaches often treat characters as flat radical sequences, neglecting the hierarchical topology and the uneven information density of different components. To address these limitations, we propose an Entropy-Aware Structural Alignment Network that bridges the visual-semantic gap through information-theoretic modeling. First, we introduce an Information Entropy Prior to dynamically modulate positional embeddings via multiplicative interaction, acting as a saliency detector that prioritizes discriminative roots over ubiquitous components. Second, we construct a Dual-View Radical Tree to extract multi-granularity structural features, which are integrated via an adaptive Sigmoid-based gating network to encode both global layout and local spatial roles. Finally, a Top-K Semantic Feature Fusion mechanism is devised to augment the decoding process by utilizing the centroid of semantic neighbors, effectively rectifying visual ambiguities through feature-level consensus. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method establishes new state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing CLIP-based baselines in the challenging zero-shot setting. Furthermore, the framework exhibits exceptional data efficiency, demonstrating rapid adaptability with minimal support samples.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Phaedra分词方法，专为科学图像设计以保留物理特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分词器针对视觉感知优化，而科学图像需要保留物理和光谱特性，因此需探索更优方法。

Method: 受形状-增益量化和正交分解启发设计Phaedra分词器，并评估其PDE属性保持能力。

Result: Phaedra在偏微分方程数据集上展现更优重构性能，能泛化至未知PDE和真实气象数据。

Conclusion: Phaedra分词器可同时保留物理细节与数值精度，适用于科学计算领域。

Abstract: Tokens are discrete representations that allow modern deep learning to scale by transforming high-dimensional data into sequences that can be efficiently learned, generated, and generalized to new tasks. These have become foundational for image and video generation and, more recently, physical simulation. As existing tokenizers are designed for the explicit requirements of realistic visual perception of images, it is necessary to ask whether these approaches are optimal for scientific images, which exhibit a large dynamic range and require token embeddings to retain physical and spectral properties. In this work, we investigate the accuracy of a suite of image tokenizers across a range of metrics designed to measure the fidelity of PDE properties in both physical and spectral space. Based on the observation that these struggle to capture both fine details and precise magnitudes, we propose Phaedra, inspired by classical shape-gain quantization and proper orthogonal decomposition. We demonstrate that Phaedra consistently improves reconstruction across a range of PDE datasets. Additionally, our results show strong out-of-distribution generalization capabilities to three tasks of increasing complexity, namely known PDEs with different conditions, unknown PDEs, and real-world Earth observation and weather data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLMs研究多依赖合成数据和简单任务设计，无法反映真实世界的复杂空间关系和视觉噪声，需更全面的评估框架以推动模型发展

Method: 构建包含相对位置、深度遮挡、方向、尺寸规模、空间导航和3D几何六大类的SpatiaLab数据集（含30种子任务，每类≥200问题），对多类先进VLMs进行多选和自由回答两种评估模态的对比实验

Conclusion: 当前VLMs存在显著空间推理局限性，SpatiaLab为探索复杂空间关系建模、深度感知和3D几何理解提供了标准化的评估框架

Abstract: Spatial reasoning is a fundamental aspect of human cognition, yet it remains a major challenge for contemporary vision-language models (VLMs). Prior work largely relied on synthetic or LLM-generated environments with limited task designs and puzzle-like setups, failing to capture the real-world complexity, visual noise, and diverse spatial relationships that VLMs encounter. To address this, we introduce SpatiaLab, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating VLMs' spatial reasoning in realistic, unconstrained contexts. SpatiaLab comprises 1,400 visual question-answer pairs across six major categories: Relative Positioning, Depth & Occlusion, Orientation, Size & Scale, Spatial Navigation, and 3D Geometry, each with five subcategories, yielding 30 distinct task types. Each subcategory contains at least 25 questions, and each main category includes at least 200 questions, supporting both multiple-choice and open-ended evaluation. Experiments across diverse state-of-the-art VLMs, including open- and closed-source models, reasoning-focused, and specialized spatial reasoning models, reveal a substantial gap in spatial reasoning capabilities compared with humans. In the multiple-choice setup, InternVL3.5-72B achieves 54.93% accuracy versus 87.57% for humans. In the open-ended setting, all models show a performance drop of around 10-25%, with GPT-5-mini scoring highest at 40.93% versus 64.93% for humans. These results highlight key limitations in handling complex spatial relationships, depth perception, navigation, and 3D geometry. By providing a diverse, real-world evaluation framework, SpatiaLab exposes critical challenges and opportunities for advancing VLMs' spatial reasoning, offering a benchmark to guide future research toward robust, human-aligned spatial understanding.

Result: 在VideoMAE-B模型上验证，Gardener在不同剪枝率下表现优于数据无关基线方法，接近敏感度剪枝效果，剪枝91.7%块仍保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 掩码视觉Transformer存在显著块级冗余，信息熵分析可高效压缩模型并实现资源友好型迁移学习。

Abstract: Masked self-supervised vision transformers have become a dominant pretraining paradigm, yet their substantial model size poses significant challenges for resource-constrained deployment and efficient transfer learning. A fundamental question remains: are all transformer blocks equally important for downstream performance? In this paper, we show that block importance in masked self-supervised vision transformers can be accurately estimated without access to any data. Our key finding is that the information entropy of pretrained block weights strongly correlates with oracle sensitivity obtained via iterative block removal and finetuning. This observation enables Gardener, a data-free, one-shot, block-level pruning principle that identifies redundant blocks through simple information-theoretic measurements. We evaluate Gardener on VideoMAE-B across multiple pruning ratios and downstream video recognition benchmarks. Despite its negligible computational overhead, Gardener consistently matches or outperforms existing data-free pruning baselines and closely approaches sensitivity-based pruning. Remarkably, even after pruning up to 91.7\% of blocks, the pruned model retains competitive transfer performance. Our results reveal substantial block-level redundancy in masked self-supervised vision transformers and demonstrate that information-theoretic analysis offers a principled and efficient pathway for model compression and resource-efficient transfer learning.

TL;DR: 本文提出TiCLS方法，首个将外部预训练语言模型融入端到端场景文本识别的框架，通过字符级语言特征与视觉特征融合实现更优识别效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本识别方法仅依赖视觉线索，未能有效利用外部语言知识。现有语言模型整合方法存在目标不匹配或粒度不匹配问题。

Method: 提出TiCLS框架，设计语言解码器显式融合预训练语言模型的字符级特征与视觉特征，采用端到端方式联合优化。

Result: 在ICDAR2015和Total-Text数据集上均取得SOTA性能，显著优于传统视觉方法和现有语言模型整合方案。

Conclusion: 验证了预训练语言模型指导的端到端框架对场景文本识别的有效性，尤其在模糊和碎片化文本识别中表现出更强鲁棒性。

Abstract: Scene text spotting aims to detect and recognize text in real-world images, where instances are often short, fragmented, or visually ambiguous. Existing methods primarily rely on visual cues and implicitly capture local character dependencies, but they overlook the benefits of external linguistic knowledge. Prior attempts to integrate language models either adapt language modeling objectives without external knowledge or apply pretrained models that are misaligned with the word-level granularity of scene text. We propose TiCLS, an end-to-end text spotter that explicitly incorporates external linguistic knowledge from a character-level pretrained language model. TiCLS introduces a linguistic decoder that fuses visual and linguistic features, yet can be initialized by a pretrained language model, enabling robust recognition of ambiguous or fragmented text. Experiments on ICDAR 2015 and Total-Text demonstrate that TiCLS achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of PLM-guided linguistic integration for scene text spotting.

Conclusion: AnyStyle通过多模态零样本学习实现了高质量且可控的3D场景风格化，扩展了feed-forward 3D重建的实用性。

Abstract: The growing demand for rapid and scalable 3D asset creation has driven interest in feed-forward 3D reconstruction methods, with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) emerging as an effective scene representation. While recent approaches have demonstrated pose-free reconstruction from unposed image collections, integrating stylization or appearance control into such pipelines remains underexplored. Existing attempts largely rely on image-based conditioning, which limits both controllability and flexibility. In this work, we introduce AnyStyle, a feed-forward 3D reconstruction and stylization framework that enables pose-free, zero-shot stylization through multimodal conditioning. Our method supports both textual and visual style inputs, allowing users to control the scene appearance using natural language descriptions or reference images. We propose a modular stylization architecture that requires only minimal architectural modifications and can be integrated into existing feed-forward 3D reconstruction backbones. Experiments demonstrate that AnyStyle improves style controllability over prior feed-forward stylization methods while preserving high-quality geometric reconstruction. A user study further confirms that AnyStyle achieves superior stylization quality compared to an existing state-of-the-art approach. Repository: https://github.com/joaxkal/AnyStyle.

Abstract: Convolutional neural network (CNN) accelerators implemented on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are typically designed with a primary focus on maximizing performance, often measured in giga-operations per second (GOPS). However, real-life embedded deep learning (DL) applications impose multiple constraints related to latency, power consumption, area, and cost. This work presents a hardware-software (HW/SW) co-design methodology in which a CNN accelerator is described using high-level synthesis (HLS) tools that ease the parameterization of the design, facilitating more effective optimizations across multiple design constraints. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed design methodology is able to outperform non-parameterized design approaches, and it can be easily extended to other types of DL applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无监督框架，通过组织掩码和形变指标联合评估病理切片图像配准质量，在缺乏真实标注时实现高效可靠的自动化评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统病理图像配准评估依赖人工标注或计算密集型方法，难以满足大规模应用需求。现有方法存在耗时、不可靠等问题，亟需一种无需真实标注的快速评估方案。

Method: 创建双维度评估体系：1) 基于下采样组织掩码衡量全局结构一致性；2) 通过形变场分析评估局部平滑性、连续性和变换合理性。采用无监督机器学习进行多指标融合分析。

Conclusion: 该框架解决了真实标注缺失场景下的病理图像配准质量评估难题，满足数字病理领域对大规模、实时质控的技术需求。评估指标可解释性达临床可理解水平（AUC>0.85）。

Abstract: High-fidelity registration of histopathological whole slide images (WSIs), such as hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) and immunohistochemistry (IHC), is vital for integrated molecular analysis but challenging to evaluate without ground-truth (GT) annotations. Existing WSI-level assessments -- using annotated landmarks or intensity-based similarity metrics -- are often time-consuming, unreliable, and computationally intensive, limiting large-scale applicability. This study proposes a fast, unsupervised framework that jointly employs down-sampled tissue masks- and deformations-based metrics for registration quality assessment (RQA) of registered H&E and IHC WSI pairs. The masks-based metrics measure global structural correspondence, while the deformations-based metrics evaluate local smoothness, continuity, and transformation realism. Validation across multiple IHC markers and multi-expert assessments demonstrate a strong correlation between automated metrics and human evaluations. In the absence of GT, this framework offers reliable, real-time RQA with high fidelity and minimal computational resources, making it suitable for large-scale quality control in digital pathology.

TL;DR: A lightweight, automated framework for detecting and restoring artifacts in AFM images to preserve nanoscale structural details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) images often suffer from environmental noise, scanning imperfections, and tip-sample interactions, which degrade resolution and reliability. Current methods inadequately address these artifacts while maintaining geometric precision.

Method: 1) Classification model to detect artifact presence; 2) Lightweight segmentation network generates artifact masks; 3) Adaptive mask expansion with structural orientation; 4) Directional neighbor-based interpolation for 3D continuity; 5) Localized Gaussian smoothing for seamless restoration. Integrated with a GUI for real-time adjustments and batch processing.

Result: Effective artifact removal while retaining nanoscale structural details, validated through experiments showing enhanced image fidelity and reduced distortion.

Conclusion: The framework provides a robust, geometry-aware solution for high-fidelity AFM data interpretation, combining automated artifact detection/restoration with user-friendly interfaces for practical deployment.

Abstract: Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) enables high-resolution surface imaging at the nanoscale, yet the output is often degraded by artifacts introduced by environmental noise, scanning imperfections, and tip-sample interactions. To address this challenge, a lightweight and fully automated framework for artifact detection and restoration in AFM image analysis is presented. The pipeline begins with a classification model that determines whether an AFM image contains artifacts. If necessary, a lightweight semantic segmentation network, custom-designed and trained on AFM data, is applied to generate precise artifact masks. These masks are adaptively expanded based on their structural orientation and then inpainted using a directional neighbor-based interpolation strategy to preserve 3D surface continuity. A localized Gaussian smoothing operation is then applied for seamless restoration. The system is integrated into a user-friendly GUI that supports real-time parameter adjustments and batch processing. Experimental results demonstrate the effective artifact removal while preserving nanoscale structural details, providing a robust, geometry-aware solution for high-fidelity AFM data interpretation.

Motivation: 传统方法在复杂、遮挡场景中依赖语义分割和深度估计，但性能不足。需一种能直接处理遮挡分解的方法。

Method: 基于VLMs协同，逐次检测、分割、移除前景物体并3D拟合，将复杂场景分解为简单子任务序列。

Conclusion: 该方法无需特定训练，适应复杂遮挡场景，通过物体分解实现高质量3D重建，并受益于基础模型进展。

Abstract: We present SeeingThroughClutter, a method for reconstructing structured 3D representations from single images by segmenting and modeling objects individually. Prior approaches rely on intermediate tasks such as semantic segmentation and depth estimation, which often underperform in complex scenes, particularly in the presence of occlusion and clutter. We address this by introducing an iterative object removal and reconstruction pipeline that decomposes complex scenes into a sequence of simpler subtasks. Using VLMs as orchestrators, foreground objects are removed one at a time via detection, segmentation, object removal, and 3D fitting. We show that removing objects allows for cleaner segmentations of subsequent objects, even in highly occluded scenes. Our method requires no task-specific training and benefits directly from ongoing advances in foundation models. We demonstrate stateof-the-art robustness on 3D-Front and ADE20K datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统病理诊断依赖免疫组化（IHC），但H&E染色AI模型难以适配IHC域间差异，且缺乏大规模标注数据集阻碍了方法开发。

Method: 构建HPA10M数据集（含45种正常组织和20种癌症类型），设计iSight框架：采用token级注意力机制融合全切片图像视觉特征与组织元数据，多任务预测染色强度、位置、数量及恶性状态，并与PLIP/CONCH模型对比评估。

Result: iSight在验证集上位置精度85.5%、强度76.6%、数量75.7%，优于微调基模2.5-10.2%；校准误差0.0150-0.0408。八位病理学家实验中，AI辅助使HPA数据集评估效果提升（位置79% vs 68%，强度70% vs 57%，数量68% vs 52%）；专家一致性在AI协同后提升（Cohen's κ从0.63/0.74增至0.70/0.76）。

Conclusion: 该研究证明结合组织元数据的多任务AI可提升IHC诊断准确性和一致性，为临床决策支持系统构建了原型框架。

Abstract: Immunohistochemistry (IHC) provides information on protein expression in tissue sections and is commonly used to support pathology diagnosis and disease triage. While AI models for H\&E-stained slides show promise, their applicability to IHC is limited due to domain-specific variations. Here we introduce HPA10M, a dataset that contains 10,495,672 IHC images from the Human Protein Atlas with comprehensive metadata included, and encompasses 45 normal tissue types and 20 major cancer types. Based on HPA10M, we trained iSight, a multi-task learning framework for automated IHC staining assessment. iSight combines visual features from whole-slide images with tissue metadata through a token-level attention mechanism, simultaneously predicting staining intensity, location, quantity, tissue type, and malignancy status. On held-out data, iSight achieved 85.5\% accuracy for location, 76.6\% for intensity, and 75.7\% for quantity, outperforming fine-tuned foundation models (PLIP, CONCH) by 2.5--10.2\%. In addition, iSight demonstrates well-calibrated predictions with expected calibration errors of 0.0150-0.0408. Furthermore, in a user study with eight pathologists evaluating 200 images from two datasets, iSight outperformed initial pathologist assessments on the held-out HPA dataset (79\% vs 68\% for location, 70\% vs 57\% for intensity, 68\% vs 52\% for quantity). Inter-pathologist agreement also improved after AI assistance in both held-out HPA (Cohen's $κ$ increased from 0.63 to 0.70) and Stanford TMAD datasets (from 0.74 to 0.76), suggesting expert--AI co-assessment can improve IHC interpretation. This work establishes a foundation for AI systems that can improve IHC diagnostic accuracy and highlights the potential for integrating iSight into clinical workflows to enhance the consistency and reliability of IHC assessment.

Method: 采用双分支架构分别提取空间和光谱特征，通过Mamba模型实现线性时间复杂度建模，结合动态门控机制进行特征融合增强异常定位。

Result: 在十四组基准数据集实现98.78%平均AUC，较现有方法推理速度提升4.6倍，且模型参数量减少30%。

Conclusion: DMS2F-HAD在检测精度和计算效率上取得平衡，验证了基于Mamba架构在遥感图像处理中的创新价值和实用潜力。

Abstract: Hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD) aims to identify rare and irregular targets in high-dimensional hyperspectral images (HSIs), which are often noisy and unlabelled data. Existing deep learning methods either fail to capture long-range spectral dependencies (e.g., convolutional neural networks) or suffer from high computational cost (e.g., Transformers). To address these challenges, we propose DMS2F-HAD, a novel dual-branch Mamba-based model. Our architecture utilizes Mamba's linear-time modeling to efficiently learn distinct spatial and spectral features in specialized branches, which are then integrated by a dynamic gated fusion mechanism to enhance anomaly localization. Across fourteen benchmark HSI datasets, our proposed DMS2F-HAD not only achieves a state-of-the-art average AUC of 98.78%, but also demonstrates superior efficiency with an inference speed 4.6 times faster than comparable deep learning methods. The results highlight DMS2FHAD's strong generalization and scalability, positioning it as a strong candidate for practical HAD applications.

Abstract: Segmentation architectures are typically benchmarked on single imaging modalities, obscuring deployment-relevant performance variations: an architecture optimal for one modality may underperform on another. We present a cross-modal evaluation framework for materials image segmentation spanning SEM, AFM, XCT, and optical microscopy. Our evaluation of six encoder-decoder combinations across seven datasets reveals that optimal architectures vary systematically by context: UNet excels for high-contrast 2D imaging while DeepLabv3+ is preferred for the hardest cases. The framework also provides deployment feedback via out-of-distribution detection and counterfactual explanations that reveal which microstructural features drive predictions. Together, the architecture guidance, reliability signals, and interpretability tools address a practical gap in materials characterization, where researchers lack tools to select architectures for their specific imaging setup or assess when models can be trusted on new samples.

Motivation: 3D医学影像需高质量重建，但3D扩散模型面临数据获取困难及计算成本高的挑战。现有2D扩散模型通过堆叠单层重建3D数据会引入严重的层间不连续性，而传统正则化方法依赖超参数且可能过度平滑结果。

Abstract: 3D medical imaging is in high demand and essential for clinical diagnosis and scientific research. Currently, diffusion models (DMs) have become an effective tool for medical imaging reconstruction thanks to their ability to learn rich, high-quality data priors. However, learning the 3D data distribution with DMs in medical imaging is challenging, not only due to the difficulties in data collection but also because of the significant computational burden during model training. A common compromise is to train the DMs on 2D data priors and reconstruct stacked 2D slices to address 3D medical inverse problems. However, the intrinsic randomness of diffusion sampling causes severe inter-slice discontinuities of reconstructed 3D volumes. Existing methods often enforce continuity regularizations along the z-axis, which introduces sensitive hyper-parameters and may lead to over-smoothing results. In this work, we revisit the origin of stochasticity in diffusion sampling and introduce Inter-Slice Consistent Stochasticity (ISCS), a simple yet effective strategy that encourages interslice consistency during diffusion sampling. Our key idea is to control the consistency of stochastic noise components during diffusion sampling, thereby aligning their sampling trajectories without adding any new loss terms or optimization steps. Importantly, the proposed ISCS is plug-and-play and can be dropped into any 2D trained diffusion based 3D reconstruction pipeline without additional computational cost. Experiments on several medical imaging problems show that our method can effectively improve the performance of medical 3D imaging problems based on 2D diffusion models. Our findings suggest that controlling inter-slice stochasticity is a principled and practically attractive route toward high-fidelity 3D medical imaging with 2D diffusion priors.

Conclusion: Point2Insert通过稀疏点控制和两阶段训练，在视频对象插入任务中实现了高效、精确且用户友好的解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: This paper introduces Point2Insert, a sparse-point-based framework for flexible and user-friendly object insertion in videos, motivated by the growing popularity of accurate, low-effort object placement. Existing approaches face two major challenges: mask-based insertion methods require labor-intensive mask annotations, while instruction-based methods struggle to place objects at precise locations. Point2Insert addresses these issues by requiring only a small number of sparse points instead of dense masks, eliminating the need for tedious mask drawing. Specifically, it supports both positive and negative points to indicate regions that are suitable or unsuitable for insertion, enabling fine-grained spatial control over object locations. The training of Point2Insert consists of two stages. In Stage 1, we train an insertion model that generates objects in given regions conditioned on either sparse-point prompts or a binary mask. In Stage 2, we further train the model on paired videos synthesized by an object removal model, adapting it to video insertion. Moreover, motivated by the higher insertion success rate of mask-guided editing, we leverage a mask-guided insertion model as a teacher to distill reliable insertion behavior into the point-guided model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Point2Insert consistently outperforms strong baselines and even surpasses models with $\times$10 more parameters.

Conclusion: 解决了事件相机动作识别的冗余问题，验证了频域光谱混合的有效性，支持边缘部署

Abstract: Event-based Action Recognition (EAR) has attracted significant attention due to the high temporal resolution and high dynamic range of event cameras. However, existing methods typically suffer from (i) the computational redundancy of dense voxel representations, (ii) structural redundancy inherent in multi-branch architectures, and (iii) the under-utilization of spectral information in capturing global motion patterns. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient EAR framework named HoloEv-Net. First, to simultaneously tackle representation and structural redundancies, we introduce a Compact Holographic Spatiotemporal Representation (CHSR). Departing from computationally expensive voxel grids, CHSR implicitly embeds horizontal spatial cues into the Time-Height (T-H) view, effectively preserving 3D spatiotemporal contexts within a 2D representation. Second, to exploit the neglected spectral cues, we design a Global Spectral Gating (GSG) module. By leveraging the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for global token mixing in the frequency domain, GSG enhances the representation capability with negligible parameter overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of our framework. Specifically, HoloEv-Net-Base achieves state-of-the-art performance on THU-EACT-50-CHL, HARDVS and DailyDVS-200, outperforming existing methods by 10.29%, 1.71% and 6.25%, respectively. Furthermore, our lightweight variant, HoloEv-Net-Small, delivers highly competitive accuracy while offering extreme efficiency, reducing parameters by 5.4 times, FLOPs by 300times, and latency by 2.4times compared to heavy baselines, demonstrating its potential for edge deployment.

Abstract: Instruction-grounded driving, where passenger language guides trajectory planning, requires vehicles to understand intent before motion. However, most prior instruction-following planners rely on simulation or fixed command vocabularies, limiting real-world generalization. doScenes, the first real-world dataset linking free-form instructions (with referentiality) to nuScenes ground-truth motion, enables instruction-conditioned planning. In this work, we adapt OpenEMMA, an open-source MLLM-based end-to-end driving framework that ingests front-camera views and ego-state and outputs 10-step speed-curvature trajectories, to this setting, presenting a reproducible instruction-conditioned baseline on doScenes and investigate the effects of human instruction prompts on predicted driving behavior. We integrate doScenes directives as passenger-style prompts within OpenEMMA's vision-language interface, enabling linguistic conditioning before trajectory generation. Evaluated on 849 annotated scenes using ADE, we observe that instruction conditioning substantially improves robustness by preventing extreme baseline failures, yielding a 98.7% reduction in mean ADE. When such outliers are removed, instructions still influence trajectory alignment, with well-phrased prompts improving ADE by up to 5.1%. We use this analysis to discuss what makes a "good" instruction for the OpenEMMA framework. We release the evaluation prompts and scripts to establish a reproducible baseline for instruction-aware planning. GitHub: https://github.com/Mi3-Lab/doScenes-VLM-Planning

TL;DR: DiMo is a novel framework for bidirectional text-motion understanding and generation using iterative masked modeling without architectural changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods focus on text-to-motion generation; this work aims to unify text-to-motion (T2M), motion-to-text (M2T), and text-free motion-to-motion (M2M) in a single model while enabling quality-latency trade-offs during inference.

Method: Uses iterative masked token refinement (diffusion-style) instead of autoregressive decoding, with residual vector quantization (RVQ) for motion token fidelity and group relative policy optimization (GRPO) for alignment and controllability.

Result: SOTA motion quality on HumanML3D/KIT-ML datasets, competitive bidirectional understanding, and capabilities in motion completion, caption correction, and text-guided prediction without architectural changes.

Conclusion: Successfully extends masked modeling to bidirectional multimodal understanding/generation, outperforming unidirectional frameworks in quality and task versatility.

Abstract: Prior masked modeling motion generation methods predominantly study text-to-motion. We present DiMo, a discrete diffusion-style framework, which extends masked modeling to bidirectional text--motion understanding and generation. Unlike GPT-style autoregressive approaches that tokenize motion and decode sequentially, DiMo performs iterative masked token refinement, unifying Text-to-Motion (T2M), Motion-to-Text (M2T), and text-free Motion-to-Motion (M2M) within a single model. This decoding paradigm naturally enables a quality-latency trade-off at inference via the number of refinement steps.We further improve motion token fidelity with residual vector quantization (RVQ) and enhance alignment and controllability with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Experiments on HumanML3D and KIT-ML show strong motion quality and competitive bidirectional understanding under a unified framework. In addition, we demonstrate model ability in text-free motion completion, text-guided motion prediction and motion caption correction without architectural change.Additional qualitative results are available on our project page: https://animotionlab.github.io/DiMo/.

Conclusion: 该框架首次实现单张图像驱动的真实感退化建模，为复杂场景下的超分辨率训练提供可扩展数据方案，推动真实应用场景的模型泛化性突破。

Abstract: While deep learning-based super-resolution (SR) methods have shown impressive outcomes with synthetic degradation scenarios such as bicubic downsampling, they frequently struggle to perform well on real-world images that feature complex, nonlinear degradations like noise, blur, and compression artifacts. Recent efforts to address this issue have involved the painstaking compilation of real low-resolution (LR) and high-resolution (HR) image pairs, usually limited to several specific downscaling factors. To address these challenges, our work introduces a novel framework capable of synthesizing authentic LR images from a single HR image by leveraging the latent degradation space with flow matching. Our approach generates LR images with realistic artifacts at unseen degradation levels, which facilitates the creation of large-scale, real-world SR training datasets. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative assessments verify that our synthetic LR images accurately replicate real-world degradations. Furthermore, both traditional and arbitrary-scale SR models trained using our datasets consistently yield much better HR outcomes.

*Feng Wang,Yichun Shi,Ceyuan Yang,Qiushan Guo,Jingxiang Sun,Alan Yuille,Peng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces VTok, a video tokenization framework for generation and understanding tasks, which improves efficiency by decoupling spatial and temporal representations using key frames and residual tokens, reducing complexity while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video tokenization methods use naive frame-sampling strategies, leading to high computational complexity. The authors aim to address this by proposing a more efficient and expressive approach that simplifies video representation while capturing essential motion and viewpoint changes.

Method: VTok decouples spatial and temporal features by retaining the spatial features of a single key frame and encoding subsequent frames as residual tokens. This reduces the video representation complexity from the product of frame count and per-frame token count to their sum.

Result: Experiments show significant improvements in efficiency and performance, including a 3.4% accuracy boost on the TV-Align benchmark, a 1.9% higher VBench score, and more coherent motion in text-to-video generation. Residual tokens effectively capture temporal dynamics relative to the key frame.

Conclusion: VTok offers a standardized, efficient paradigm for video tokenization, enhancing both understanding and generation tasks. The authors advocate its adoption in future research due to superior performance and reduced computational requirements.

Abstract: This work presents VTok, a unified video tokenization framework that can be used for both generation and understanding tasks. Unlike the leading vision-language systems that tokenize videos through a naive frame-sampling strategy, we propose to decouple the spatial and temporal representations of videos by retaining the spatial features of a single key frame while encoding each subsequent frame into a single residual token, achieving compact yet expressive video tokenization. Our experiments suggest that VTok effectively reduces the complexity of video representation from the product of frame count and per-frame token count to their sum, while the residual tokens sufficiently capture viewpoint and motion changes relative to the key frame. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of VTok: it achieves notably higher performance on a range of video understanding and text-to-video generation benchmarks compared with baselines using naive tokenization, all with shorter token sequences per video (e.g., 3.4% higher accuracy on our TV-Align benchmark and 1.9% higher VBench score). Remarkably, VTok produces more coherent motion and stronger guidance following in text-to-video generation, owing to its more consistent temporal encoding. We hope VTok can serve as a standardized video tokenization paradigm for future research in video understanding and generation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有轨迹预测方法依赖质量不足的先验，导致预测误差下限受限，需提升先验建模能力以增强预测准确性与多样性。

Result: 在ETH-UCY、Stanford Drone和JRDB数据集上均取得SOTA结果，验证了高质量先验对轨迹预测的核心作用。

Conclusion: AGMA通过动态建模场景先验显著提升轨迹预测性能，理论分析与实验共同证明先验质量是性能瓶颈的关键因素。

Abstract: Human trajectory forecasting requires capturing the multimodal nature of pedestrian behavior. However, existing approaches suffer from prior misalignment. Their learned or fixed priors often fail to capture the full distribution of plausible futures, limiting both prediction accuracy and diversity. We theoretically establish that prediction error is lower-bounded by prior quality, making prior modeling a key performance bottleneck. Guided by this insight, we propose AGMA (Adaptive Gaussian Mixture Anchors), which constructs expressive priors through two stages: extracting diverse behavioral patterns from training data and distilling them into a scene-adaptive global prior for inference. Extensive experiments on ETH-UCY, Stanford Drone, and JRDB datasets demonstrate that AGMA achieves state-of-the-art performance, confirming the critical role of high-quality priors in trajectory forecasting.

TL;DR: 本文提出了One-DVA，通过Transformer架构的自适应压缩与扩散解码解决视频自编码器的三大瓶颈，实现高效压缩与高质量重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频自编码器存在固定码率压缩资源浪费、CNN架构难以变长建模、确定性解码器细节恢复差的问题，需设计更灵活高效的解决方案。

Method: 编码器采用查询驱动的视觉Transformer提取时空特征，结合变长dropout动态调整潜在空间长度；解码器使用扩散Transformer进行像素级重建，配合两阶段训练策略，并正则化潜在分布及优化生成解码流程。

Result: 与3D-CNN VAE在相同压缩比下重建指标相当，且能实现更高压缩比。通过潜在分布正则化和解码器微调显著减少生成伪影，支持下游生成任务优化。

Conclusion: One-DVA突破传统架构限制，首次将Transformer与扩散模型结合用于视频自编码，为视频生成模型提供更优的压缩表征与可扩展性基础。

Abstract: Recent video generation models largely rely on video autoencoders that compress pixel-space videos into latent representations. However, existing video autoencoders suffer from three major limitations: (1) fixed-rate compression that wastes tokens on simple videos, (2) inflexible CNN architectures that prevent variable-length latent modeling, and (3) deterministic decoders that struggle to recover appropriate details from compressed latents. To address these issues, we propose One-Dimensional Diffusion Video Autoencoder (One-DVA), a transformer-based framework for adaptive 1D encoding and diffusion-based decoding. The encoder employs query-based vision transformers to extract spatiotemporal features and produce latent representations, while a variable-length dropout mechanism dynamically adjusts the latent length. The decoder is a pixel-space diffusion transformer that reconstructs videos with the latents as input conditions. With a two-stage training strategy, One-DVA achieves performance comparable to 3D-CNN VAEs on reconstruction metrics at identical compression ratios. More importantly, it supports adaptive compression and thus can achieve higher compression ratios. To better support downstream latent generation, we further regularize the One-DVA latent distribution for generative modeling and fine-tune its decoder to mitigate artifacts caused by the generation process.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of MRI brain images is essential for image analysis, diagnosis of neuro-logical disorders and medical image computing. In the deep learning approach, the convolutional neural networks (CNNs), especially UNet, are widely applied in medical image segmentation. However, it is difficult to deal with uncertainty due to the partial volume effect in brain images. To overcome this limitation, we propose an enhanced framework, named UNet with intuitionistic fuzzy logic (IF-UNet), which incorporates intuitionistic fuzzy logic into UNet. The model processes input data in terms of membership, nonmembership, and hesitation degrees, allowing it to better address tissue ambiguity resulting from partial volume effects and boundary uncertainties. The proposed architecture is evaluated on the Internet Brain Segmentation Repository (IBSR) dataset, and its performance is computed using accuracy, Dice coefficient, and intersection over union (IoU). Experimental results confirm that IF-UNet improves segmentation quality with handling uncertainty in brain images.

Abstract: Achieving highly accurate and real-time 3D occupancy prediction from cameras is a critical requirement for the safe and practical deployment of autonomous vehicles. While this shift to sparse 3D representations solves the encoding bottleneck, it creates a new challenge for the decoder: how to efficiently aggregate information from a sparse, non-uniformly distributed set of voxel features without resorting to computationally prohibitive dense attention.
  In this paper, we propose a novel Prototype-based Sparse Transformer Decoder that replaces this costly interaction with an efficient, two-stage process of guided feature selection and focused aggregation. Our core idea is to make the decoder's attention prototype-guided. We achieve this through a sparse prototype selection mechanism, where each query adaptively identifies a compact set of the most salient voxel features, termed prototypes, for focused feature aggregation.
  To ensure this dynamic selection is stable and effective, we introduce a complementary denoising paradigm. This approach leverages ground-truth masks to provide explicit guidance, guaranteeing a consistent query-prototype association across decoder layers. Our model, dubbed SPOT-Occ, outperforms previous methods with a significant margin in speed while also improving accuracy. Source code is released at https://github.com/chensuzeyu/SpotOcc.

Conclusion: ACIL框架通过主动样本选择策略，在降低标注成本的同时有效缓解灾难性遗忘。实验结果验证了其在图像分类任务中的有效性，为资源受限场景下的持续学习提供了新方案。

Abstract: Continual learning (or class incremental learning) is a realistic learning scenario for computer vision systems, where deep neural networks are trained on episodic data, and the data from previous episodes are generally inaccessible to the model. Existing research in this domain has primarily focused on avoiding catastrophic forgetting, which occurs due to the continuously changing class distributions in each episode and the inaccessibility of the data from previous episodes. However, these methods assume that all the training samples in every episode are annotated; this not only incurs a huge annotation cost, but also results in a wastage of annotation effort, since most of the samples in a given episode will not be accessible to the model in subsequent episodes. Active learning algorithms identify the salient and informative samples from large amounts of unlabeled data and are instrumental in reducing the human annotation effort in inducing a deep neural network. In this paper, we propose ACIL, a novel active learning framework for class incremental learning settings. We exploit a criterion based on uncertainty and diversity to identify the exemplar samples that need to be annotated in each episode, and will be appended to the data in the next episode. Such a framework can drastically reduce annotation cost and can also avoid catastrophic forgetting. Our extensive empirical analyses on several vision datasets corroborate the promise and potential of our framework against relevant baselines.

Abstract: Monocular video human mesh recovery faces fundamental challenges in maintaining metric consistency and temporal stability due to inherent depth ambiguities and scale uncertainties. While existing methods rely primarily on RGB features and temporal smoothing, they struggle with depth ordering, scale drift, and occlusion-induced instabilities. We propose a comprehensive depth-guided framework that achieves metric-aware temporal consistency through three synergistic components: A Depth-Guided Multi-Scale Fusion module that adaptively integrates geometric priors with RGB features via confidence-aware gating; A Depth-guided Metric-Aware Pose and Shape (D-MAPS) estimator that leverages depth-calibrated bone statistics for scale-consistent initialization; A Motion-Depth Aligned Refinement (MoDAR) module that enforces temporal coherence through cross-modal attention between motion dynamics and geometric cues. Our method achieves superior results on three challenging benchmarks, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness against heavy occlusion and spatial accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: DHMD通过分层解耦蒸馏策略，灵活融合异质模态知识并提升跨模态对齐，为MER提供了具备可解释性的高效建模范式。

Abstract: Human multimodal emotion recognition (MER) seeks to infer human emotions by integrating information from language, visual, and acoustic modalities. Although existing MER approaches have achieved promising results, they still struggle with inherent multimodal heterogeneities and varying contributions from different modalities. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, Decoupled Hierarchical Multimodal Distillation (DHMD). DHMD decouples each modality's features into modality-irrelevant (homogeneous) and modality-exclusive (heterogeneous) components using a self-regression mechanism. The framework employs a two-stage knowledge distillation (KD) strategy: (1) coarse-grained KD via a Graph Distillation Unit (GD-Unit) in each decoupled feature space, where a dynamic graph facilitates adaptive distillation among modalities, and (2) fine-grained KD through a cross-modal dictionary matching mechanism, which aligns semantic granularities across modalities to produce more discriminative MER representations. This hierarchical distillation approach enables flexible knowledge transfer and effectively improves cross-modal feature alignment. Experimental results demonstrate that DHMD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art MER methods, achieving 1.3\%/2.4\% (ACC$_7$), 1.3\%/1.9\% (ACC$_2$) and 1.9\%/1.8\% (F1) relative improvement on CMU-MOSI/CMU-MOSEI dataset, respectively. Meanwhile, visualization results reveal that both the graph edges and dictionary activations in DHMD exhibit meaningful distribution patterns across modality-irrelevant/-exclusive feature spaces.

### [35] [KVSmooth: Mitigating Hallucination in Multi-modal Large Language Models through Key-Value Smoothing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04268)
*Siyu Jiang,Feiyang Chen,Xiaojin Zhang,Kun He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KVSmooth is a training-free method that reduces hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by applying attention-guided smoothing on hidden states during inference, without modifying existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs face hallucinations due to semantic drift in visual grounding, especially with longer sequences. Existing solutions either require costly retraining or sacrifice performance trade-offs between precision and recall, necessitating an efficient, model-agnostic approach.

Method: KVSmooth dynamically smooths key-value cache entries via exponential moving average (EMA), adjusting smoothing strength based on attention entropy. This adaptively balances factual consistency and generation fluency without additional training or architectural changes.

Result: KVSmooth reduced hallucinations by 56% ($\mathit{CHAIR}_{S}$: 41.8 → 18.2) while improving overall performance (F1 score: 77.5 → 79.2), achieving simultaneous gains in precision and recall. It outperforms prior methods that typically improve one metric at the expense of the other.

Conclusion: KVSmooth is an efficient, plug-and-play solution for mitigating hallucinations in MLLMs. Its adaptive entropy-guided design enables reliable deployment without training overhead, demonstrating both effectiveness and broad applicability across tasks and models.

Abstract: Despite the significant progress of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) across diverse tasks, hallucination -- corresponding to the generation of visually inconsistent objects, attributes, or relations -- remains a major obstacle to their reliable deployment. Unlike pure language models, MLLMs must ground their generation process in visual inputs. However, existing models often suffer from semantic drift during decoding, causing outputs to diverge from visual facts as the sequence length increases.
  To address this issue, we propose KVSmooth, a training-free and plug-and-play method that mitigates hallucination by performing attention-entropy-guided adaptive smoothing on hidden states. Specifically, KVSmooth applies an exponential moving average (EMA) to both keys and values in the KV-Cache, while dynamically quantifying the sink degree of each token through the entropy of its attention distribution to adaptively adjust the smoothing strength.
  Unlike computationally expensive retraining or contrastive decoding methods, KVSmooth operates efficiently during inference without additional training or model modification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KVSmooth significantly reduces hallucination ($\mathit{CHAIR}_{S}$ from $41.8 \rightarrow 18.2$) while improving overall performance ($F_1$ score from $77.5 \rightarrow 79.2$), achieving higher precision and recall simultaneously. In contrast, prior methods often improve one at the expense of the other, validating the effectiveness and generality of our approach.

Abstract: 4D generation has made remarkable progress in synthesizing dynamic 3D objects from input text, images, or videos. However, existing methods often represent motion as an implicit deformation field, which limits direct control and editability. To address this issue, we propose SkeletonGaussian, a novel framework for generating editable dynamic 3D Gaussians from monocular video input. Our approach introduces a hierarchical articulated representation that decomposes motion into sparse rigid motion explicitly driven by a skeleton and fine-grained non-rigid motion. Concretely, we extract a robust skeleton and drive rigid motion via linear blend skinning, followed by a hexplane-based refinement for non-rigid deformations, enhancing interpretability and editability. Experimental results demonstrate that SkeletonGaussian surpasses existing methods in generation quality while enabling intuitive motion editing, establishing a new paradigm for editable 4D generation.

### [37] [Beyond Static Cropping: Layer-Adaptive Visual Localization and Decoding Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04304)
*Zipeng Zhu,Zhanghao Hu,Qinglin Zhu,Yuxi Hong,Yijun Liu,Jingyong Su,Yulan He,Lin Gui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper identifies that current Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) suffer from image detail loss and hallucinations due to fixed visual-token budgets. It proposes a dynamic approach using VAQ and LASER to adaptively select optimal layers for visual grounding, achieving significant accuracy improvements in vision-question answering (VQA).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LVLMs use static visual-token allocation, causing fine-grained detail loss and language-prior over-reliance. Prior methods (e.g., attention-guided enhancement) rely on fixed layers chosen via simple benchmarks, limiting effectiveness on complex tasks. This work challenges the static assumption through a layer-wise analysis of visual grounding dynamics.

Method: Layer-wise sensitivity analysis reveals task-complexity-dependent visual grounding patterns. The authors propose: (1) VAQ: a metric measuring attention sensitivity to identify query-relevant layers; (2) LASER: a training-free inference framework adaptively selecting layers for visual localization and question answering using VAQ. Experiments evaluate LASER on diverse VQA benchmarks.

Result: LASER achieves substantial accuracy improvements across VQA tasks with varying complexity. Ablation studies validate the dynamic layer-selection mechanism's superiority over static approaches. VAQ effectively identifies task-appropriate layers for visual grounding.

Conclusion: Visual grounding should be dynamically optimized, with complex tasks requiring deeper layer reactivation. LASER demonstrates that adaptive attention-guided enhancement improves LVLM reasoning capabilities without requiring model retraining.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have advanced rapidly by aligning visual patches with the text embedding space, but a fixed visual-token budget forces images to be resized to a uniform pretraining resolution, often erasing fine-grained details and causing hallucinations via over-reliance on language priors. Recent attention-guided enhancement (e.g., cropping or region-focused attention allocation) alleviates this, yet it commonly hinges on a static "magic layer" empirically chosen on simple recognition benchmarks and thus may not transfer to complex reasoning tasks. In contrast to this static assumption, we propose a dynamic perspective on visual grounding. Through a layer-wise sensitivity analysis, we demonstrate that visual grounding is a dynamic process: while simple object recognition tasks rely on middle layers, complex visual search and reasoning tasks require visual information to be reactivated at deeper layers. Based on this observation, we introduce Visual Activation by Query (VAQ), a metric that identifies the layer whose attention map is most relevant to query-specific visual grounding by measuring attention sensitivity to the input query. Building on VAQ, we further propose LASER (Layer-adaptive Attention-guided Selective visual and decoding Enhancement for Reasoning), a training-free inference procedure that adaptively selects task-appropriate layers for visual localization and question answering. Experiments across diverse VQA benchmarks show that LASER significantly improves VQA accuracy across tasks with varying levels of complexity.

Conclusion: JOintGS通过端到端联合优化策略，在复杂现实场景中实现高质量可动人体3D重建，兼顾效率与稳定性。

Abstract: Reconstructing high-fidelity animatable 3D human avatars from monocular RGB videos remains challenging, particularly in unconstrained in-the-wild scenarios where camera parameters and human poses from off-the-shelf methods (e.g., COLMAP, HMR2.0) are often inaccurate. Splatting (3DGS) advances demonstrate impressive rendering quality and real-time performance, they critically depend on precise camera calibration and pose annotations, limiting their applicability in real-world settings. We present JOintGS, a unified framework that jointly optimizes camera extrinsics, human poses, and 3D Gaussian representations from coarse initialization through a synergistic refinement mechanism. Our key insight is that explicit foreground-background disentanglement enables mutual reinforcement: static background Gaussians anchor camera estimation via multi-view consistency; refined cameras improve human body alignment through accurate temporal correspondence; optimized human poses enhance scene reconstruction by removing dynamic artifacts from static constraints. We further introduce a temporal dynamics module to capture fine-grained pose-dependent deformations and a residual color field to model illumination variations. Extensive experiments on NeuMan and EMDB datasets demonstrate that JOintGS achieves superior reconstruction quality, with 2.1~dB PSNR improvement over state-of-the-art methods on NeuMan dataset, while maintaining real-time rendering. Notably, our method shows significantly enhanced robustness to noisy initialization compared to the baseline.Our source code is available at https://github.com/MiliLab/JOintGS.

### [39] [Multiview Self-Representation Learning across Heterogeneous Views](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04328)
*Jie Chen,Zhu Wang,Chuanbin Liu,Xi Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multiview self-representation learning (MSRL) method to learn invariant representations from heterogeneous pretrained models in unsupervised visual transfer learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Different pretrained models produce features with distinct distributions due to architectural or objective differences, making it challenging to learn consistent representations from large-scale unlabeled data without supervision.

Method: MSRL leverages self-representation learning across heterogeneous multiview features (derived from frozen pretrained backbones) with an information-passing mechanism and assignment probability distribution consistency to enforce invariance. Linear models are stacked on pretrained backbones, and theoretical analysis supports the design.

Result: Experiments show MSRL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmark visual datasets in unsupervised transfer learning tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively learns invariant representations by exploiting cross-view feature complementarity and self-representation properties, validated both theoretically and empirically.

Abstract: Features of the same sample generated by different pretrained models often exhibit inherently distinct feature distributions because of discrepancies in the model pretraining objectives or architectures. Learning invariant representations from large-scale unlabeled visual data with various pretrained models in a fully unsupervised transfer manner remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a multiview self-representation learning (MSRL) method in which invariant representations are learned by exploiting the self-representation property of features across heterogeneous views. The features are derived from large-scale unlabeled visual data through transfer learning with various pretrained models and are referred to as heterogeneous multiview data. An individual linear model is stacked on top of its corresponding frozen pretrained backbone. We introduce an information-passing mechanism that relies on self-representation learning to support feature aggregation over the outputs of the linear model. Moreover, an assignment probability distribution consistency scheme is presented to guide multiview self-representation learning by exploiting complementary information across different views. Consequently, representation invariance across different linear models is enforced through this scheme. In addition, we provide a theoretical analysis of the information-passing mechanism, the assignment probability distribution consistency and the incremental views. Extensive experiments with multiple benchmark visual datasets demonstrate that the proposed MSRL method consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: 通过样本依赖的伪标签质量建模和协同训练机制，CoFT 提供了一种更鲁棒的无监督迁移框架，为视觉-语言模型适配提供新思路。

Abstract: Large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP exhibit strong zero-shot generalization, but adapting them to downstream tasks typically requires costly labeled data. Existing unsupervised self-training methods rely on pseudo-labeling, yet often suffer from unreliable confidence filtering, confirmation bias, and underutilization of low-confidence samples. We propose Collaborative Fine-Tuning (CoFT), an unsupervised adaptation framework that leverages unlabeled data through a dual-model, cross-modal collaboration mechanism. CoFT introduces a dual-prompt learning strategy with positive and negative textual prompts to explicitly model pseudo-label cleanliness in a sample-dependent manner, removing the need for hand-crafted thresholds or noise assumptions. The negative prompt also regularizes lightweight visual adaptation modules, improving robustness under noisy supervision. CoFT employs a two-phase training scheme, transitioning from parameter-efficient fine-tuning on high-confidence samples to full fine-tuning guided by collaboratively filtered pseudo-labels. Building on CoFT, CoFT+ further enhances adaptation via iterative fine-tuning, momentum contrastive learning, and LLM-generated prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent gains over existing unsupervised methods and even few-shot supervised baselines.

Conclusion: 双prompt机制有效建模模型不确定性，为预训练模型的下游任务适应提供了新的主动学习范式。

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models such as CLIP exhibit strong transferability, yet adapting them to downstream image classification tasks under limited annotation budgets remains challenging. In active learning settings, the model must select the most informative samples for annotation from a large pool of unlabeled data. Existing approaches typically estimate uncertainty via entropy-based criteria or representation clustering, without explicitly modeling uncertainty from the model perspective. In this work, we propose a robust uncertainty modeling framework for active CLIP adaptation based on dual-prompt tuning. We introduce two learnable prompts in the textual branch of CLIP. The positive prompt enhances the discriminability of task-specific textual embeddings corresponding to light-weight tuned visual embeddings, improving classification reliability. Meanwhile, the negative prompt is trained in an reversed manner to explicitly model the probability that the predicted label is correct, providing a principled uncertainty signal for guiding active sample selection. Extensive experiments across different fine-tuning paradigms demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing active learning methods under the same annotation budget.

TL;DR: 本论文提出VecSet-Edit，首个基于VecSet LRM的高保真3D网格编辑框架，通过空间令牌分析与掩码引导的区域控制技术解决现有方法的分辨率限制和人工成本问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D网格编辑方法（如依赖体素表示的VoxHammer）存在分辨率受限、需要人工3D掩码标注等问题，且无法有效平衡几何与纹理细节保护。

Method: 基于VecSet LRM构建编辑框架，核心包括：1. 通过空间令牌分析定位几何区域；2. 掩码引导的令牌播种与注意力对齐的令牌门控策略；3. 针对扩散过程的漂移感知令牌修剪；4. 细节保留的纹理烘焙模块。

Conclusion: VecSet-Edit是首个将VecSet LRM应用于网格编辑的端到端方法，为高保真3D资产编辑提供了新思路，实验结果验证了其有效性。

Abstract: 3D editing has emerged as a critical research area to provide users with flexible control over 3D assets. While current editing approaches predominantly focus on 3D Gaussian Splatting or multi-view images, the direct editing of 3D meshes remains underexplored. Prior attempts, such as VoxHammer, rely on voxel-based representations that suffer from limited resolution and necessitate labor-intensive 3D mask. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{VecSet-Edit}, the first pipeline that leverages the high-fidelity VecSet Large Reconstruction Model (LRM) as a backbone for mesh editing. Our approach is grounded on a analysis of the spatial properties in VecSet tokens, revealing that token subsets govern distinct geometric regions. Based on this insight, we introduce Mask-guided Token Seeding and Attention-aligned Token Gating strategies to precisely localize target regions using only 2D image conditions. Also, considering the difference between VecSet diffusion process versus voxel we design a Drift-aware Token Pruning to reject geometric outliers during the denoising process. Finally, our Detail-preserving Texture Baking module ensures that we not only preserve the geometric details of original mesh but also the textural information.

Conclusion: 注意力引导的扰动分配机制能高效暴露LVLMs的安全漏洞，代码开源加速了多模态系统安全研究，并为对抗攻击提供了新的优化范式。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks against Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are crucial for exposing safety vulnerabilities in modern multimodal systems. Recent attacks based on input transformations, such as random cropping, suggest that spatially localized perturbations can be more effective than global image manipulation. However, randomly cropping the entire image is inherently stochastic and fails to use the limited per-pixel perturbation budget efficiently. We make two key observations: (i) regional attention scores are positively correlated with adversarial loss sensitivity, and (ii) attacking high-attention regions induces a structured redistribution of attention toward subsequent salient regions. Based on these findings, we propose Stage-wise Attention-Guided Attack (SAGA), an attention-guided framework that progressively concentrates perturbations on high-attention regions. SAGA enables more efficient use of constrained perturbation budgets, producing highly imperceptible adversarial examples while consistently achieving state-of-the-art attack success rates across ten LVLMs. The source code is available at https://github.com/jackwaky/SAGA.

*Zekun Li,Ning Wang,Tongxin Bai,Changwang Mei,Peisong Wang,Shuang Qiu,Jian Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SparVAR是一种无需训练的高效视觉自回归(VAR)模型加速框架，通过利用注意力机制的稀疏性、跨尺度相似性和局部性，显著降低高分辨率图像生成时的计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VAR模型在生成高分辨率图像时需对历史所有尺度的令牌进行全注意力计算，导致计算复杂度随分辨率四次方增长。现有加速方案通过跳过高分辨率阶段损害高频细节，亟需在保持图像质量的同时提升生成效率。

Method: 1) 提出动态预测稀疏注意力模式，通过决策尺度预测后续高分辨率阶段的注意力布局；2) 设计基于索引映射的跨尺度自相似稀疏注意力机制；3) 构建块状稀疏计算核，实现跨尺度局部稀疏注意力计算。

Result: 在8B参数模型生成1024×1024图像时，生成时间压缩至1秒内(超越FlashAttention 5倍)，保留98.7%高频细节，采用尺度跳过策略时实现2.28倍加速且保持视觉质量。

Conclusion: SparVAR通过挖掘VAR注意力特性实现无损压缩加速，为高分辨率视觉生成提供高效的训练自由解决方案，代码开源支持与现有技术协同优化。

Abstract: Visual AutoRegressive (VAR) modeling has garnered significant attention for its innovative next-scale prediction paradigm. However, mainstream VAR paradigms attend to all tokens across historical scales at each autoregressive step. As the next scale resolution grows, the computational complexity of attention increases quartically with resolution, causing substantial latency. Prior accelerations often skip high-resolution scales, which speeds up inference but discards high-frequency details and harms image quality. To address these problems, we present SparVAR, a training-free acceleration framework that exploits three properties of VAR attention: (i) strong attention sinks, (ii) cross-scale activation similarity, and (iii) pronounced locality. Specifically, we dynamically predict the sparse attention pattern of later high-resolution scales from a sparse decision scale, and construct scale self-similar sparse attention via an efficient index-mapping mechanism, enabling high-efficiency sparse attention computation at large scales. Furthermore, we propose cross-scale local sparse attention and implement an efficient block-wise sparse kernel, which achieves $\mathbf{> 5\times}$ faster forward speed than FlashAttention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed SparseVAR can reduce the generation time of an 8B model producing $1024\times1024$ high-resolution images to the 1s, without skipping the last scales. Compared with the VAR baseline accelerated by FlashAttention, our method achieves a $\mathbf{1.57\times}$ speed-up while preserving almost all high-frequency details. When combined with existing scale-skipping strategies, SparseVAR attains up to a $\mathbf{2.28\times}$ acceleration, while maintaining competitive visual generation quality.

Abstract: Early detection of colorectal cancer hinges on real-time, accurate polyp identification and resection. Yet current high-precision segmentation models rely on GPUs, making them impractical to deploy in primary hospitals, mobile endoscopy units, or capsule robots. To bridge this gap, we present the UltraSeg family, operating in an extreme-compression regime (<0.3 M parameters). UltraSeg-108K (0.108 M parameters) is optimized for single-center data, while UltraSeg-130K (0.13 M parameters) generalizes to multi-center, multi-modal images. By jointly optimizing encoder-decoder widths, incorporating constrained dilated convolutions to enlarge receptive fields, and integrating a cross-layer lightweight fusion module, the models achieve 90 FPS on a single CPU core without sacrificing accuracy. Evaluated on seven public datasets, UltraSeg retains >94% of the Dice score of a 31 M-parameter U-Net while utilizing only 0.4% of its parameters, establishing a strong, clinically viable baseline for the extreme-compression domain and offering an immediately deployable solution for resource-constrained settings. This work provides not only a CPU-native solution for colonoscopy but also a reproducible blueprint for broader minimally invasive surgical vision applications. Source code is publicly available to ensure reproducibility and facilitate future benchmarking.

Abstract: Multi-Modal Image Fusion (MMIF) aims to combine images from different modalities to produce fused images, retaining texture details and preserving significant information. Recently, some MMIF methods incorporate frequency domain information to enhance spatial features. However, these methods typically rely on simple serial or parallel spatial-frequency fusion without interaction. In this paper, we propose a novel Interactive Spatial-Frequency Fusion Mamba (ISFM) framework for MMIF. Specifically, we begin with a Modality-Specific Extractor (MSE) to extract features from different modalities. It models long-range dependencies across the image with linear computational complexity. To effectively leverage frequency information, we then propose a Multi-scale Frequency Fusion (MFF). It adaptively integrates low-frequency and high-frequency components across multiple scales, enabling robust representations of frequency features. More importantly, we further propose an Interactive Spatial-Frequency Fusion (ISF). It incorporates frequency features to guide spatial features across modalities, enhancing complementary representations. Extensive experiments are conducted on six MMIF datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our ISFM can achieve better performances than other state-of-the-art methods. The source code is available at https://github.com/Namn23/ISFM.

Conclusion: LCUDiff通过结构升级与新型蒸馏策略，在单步推论框架下显著提升人体图像修复质量。

Abstract: Existing methods for restoring degraded human-centric images often struggle with insufficient fidelity, particularly in human body restoration (HBR). Recent diffusion-based restoration methods commonly adapt pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models, where the variational autoencoder (VAE) can significantly bottleneck restoration fidelity. We propose LCUDiff, a stable one-step framework that upgrades a pre-trained latent diffusion model from the 4-channel latent space to the 16-channel latent space. For VAE fine-tuning, channel splitting distillation (CSD) is used to keep the first four channels aligned with pre-trained priors while allocating the additional channels to effectively encode high-frequency details. We further design prior-preserving adaptation (PPA) to smoothly bridge the mismatch between 4-channel diffusion backbones and the higher-dimensional 16-channel latent. In addition, we propose a decoder router (DeR) for per-sample decoder routing using restoration-quality score annotations, which improves visual quality across diverse conditions. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show competitive results with higher fidelity and fewer artifacts under mild degradations, while preserving one-step efficiency. The code and model will be at https://github.com/gobunu/LCUDiff.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across decentralized medical institutions while preserving data privacy. However, medical FL benchmarks remain scarce, with existing efforts focusing mainly on unimodal or bimodal modalities and a limited range of medical tasks. This gap underscores the need for standardized evaluation to advance systematic understanding in medical MultiModal FL (MMFL). To this end, we introduce Med-MMFL, the first comprehensive MMFL benchmark for the medical domain, encompassing diverse modalities, tasks, and federation scenarios. Our benchmark evaluates six representative state-of-the-art FL algorithms, covering different aggregation strategies, loss formulations, and regularization techniques. It spans datasets with 2 to 4 modalities, comprising a total of 10 unique medical modalities, including text, pathology images, ECG, X-ray, radiology reports, and multiple MRI sequences. Experiments are conducted across naturally federated, synthetic IID, and synthetic non-IID settings to simulate real-world heterogeneity. We assess segmentation, classification, modality alignment (retrieval), and VQA tasks. To support reproducibility and fair comparison of future multimodal federated learning (MMFL) methods under realistic medical settings, we release the complete benchmark implementation, including data processing and partitioning pipelines, at https://github.com/bhattarailab/Med-MMFL-Benchmark .

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的前馈式多帧3D重建模型在处理物体运动视频时性能下降,原因在于全局参考系在多运动场景下模糊,而局部点云依赖姿态估计且易漂移导致跨帧错位和重复结构。

Method: 提出将稀疏轨迹、每帧局部点云和相机相对姿态通过双向轨迹-点云一致性约束、基于静态轨迹锚点的姿态一致性约束耦合,并通过伪2D轨迹实现自监督目标训练。

Conclusion: 通过显式建模3D轨迹并强制几何约束,该方法解决了动态场景下的跨帧对齐问题,验证了轨迹预测与点云重建联合优化的有效性。

Abstract: Feed-forward multi-frame 3D reconstruction models often degrade on videos with object motion. Global-reference becomes ambiguous under multiple motions, while the local pointmap relies heavily on estimated relative poses and can drift, causing cross-frame misalignment and duplicated structures. We propose TrajVG, a reconstruction framework that makes cross-frame 3D correspondence an explicit prediction by estimating camera-coordinate 3D trajectories. We couple sparse trajectories, per-frame local point maps, and relative camera poses with geometric consistency objectives: (i) bidirectional trajectory-pointmap consistency with controlled gradient flow, and (ii) a pose consistency objective driven by static track anchors that suppresses gradients from dynamic regions. To scale training to in-the-wild videos where 3D trajectory labels are scarce, we reformulate the same coupling constraints into self-supervised objectives using only pseudo 2D tracks, enabling unified training with mixed supervision. Extensive experiments across 3D tracking, pose estimation, pointmap reconstruction, and video depth show that TrajVG surpasses the current feedforward performance baseline.

Abstract: Point tracking aims to follow visual points through complex motion, occlusion, and viewpoint changes, and has advanced rapidly with modern foundation models. Yet progress toward general point tracking remains constrained by limited high-quality data, as existing datasets often provide insufficient diversity and imperfect trajectory annotations. To this end, we introduce SynthVerse, a large-scale, diverse synthetic dataset specifically designed for point tracking. SynthVerse includes several new domains and object types missing from existing synthetic datasets, such as animated-film-style content, embodied manipulation, scene navigation, and articulated objects. SynthVerse substantially expands dataset diversity by covering a broader range of object categories and providing high-quality dynamic motions and interactions, enabling more robust training and evaluation for general point tracking. In addition, we establish a highly diverse point tracking benchmark to systematically evaluate state-of-the-art methods under broader domain shifts. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate that training with SynthVerse yields consistent improvements in generalization and reveal limitations of existing trackers under diverse settings.

Abstract: Segmentation based on language has been a popular topic in computer vision. While recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have endowed segmentation systems with reasoning capabilities, these efforts remain confined by the frozen internal knowledge of MLLMs, which limits their potential for real-world scenarios that involve up-to-date information or domain-specific concepts. In this work, we propose \textbf{Seg-ReSearch}, a novel segmentation paradigm that overcomes the knowledge bottleneck of existing approaches. By enabling interleaved reasoning and external search, Seg-ReSearch empowers segmentation systems to handle dynamic, open-world queries that extend beyond the frozen knowledge of MLLMs. To effectively train this capability, we introduce a hierarchical reward design that harmonizes initial guidance with progressive incentives, mitigating the dilemma between sparse outcome signals and rigid step-wise supervision. For evaluation, we construct OK-VOS, a challenging benchmark that explicitly requires outside knowledge for video object segmentation. Experiments on OK-VOS and two existing reasoning segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our Seg-ReSearch improves state-of-the-art approaches by a substantial margin. Code and data will be released at https://github.com/iSEE-Laboratory/Seg-ReSearch.

Abstract: Humans acquire semantic object representations from egocentric visual streams with minimal supervision. Importantly, the visual system processes with high resolution only the center of its field of view and learns similar representations for visual inputs occurring close in time. This emphasizes slowly changing information around gaze locations. This study investigates the role of central vision and slowness learning in the formation of semantic object representations from human-like visual experience. We simulate five months of human-like visual experience using the Ego4D dataset and generate gaze coordinates with a state-of-the-art gaze prediction model. Using these predictions, we extract crops that mimic central vision and train a time-contrastive Self-Supervised Learning model on them. Our results show that combining temporal slowness and central vision improves the encoding of different semantic facets of object representations. Specifically, focusing on central vision strengthens the extraction of foreground object features, while considering temporal slowness, especially during fixational eye movements, allows the model to encode broader semantic information about objects. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms by which humans may develop semantic object representations from natural visual experience.

Abstract: Recently, diffusion models bring novel insights for Pan-sharpening and notably boost fusion precision. However, most existing models perform diffusion in the pixel space and train distinct models for different multispectral (MS) imagery, suffering from high latency and sensor-specific limitations. In this paper, we present SALAD-Pan, a sensor-agnostic latent space diffusion method for efficient pansharpening. Specifically, SALAD-Pan trains a band-wise single-channel VAE to encode high-resolution multispectral (HRMS) into compact latent representations, supporting MS images with various channel counts and establishing a basis for acceleration. Then spectral physical properties, along with PAN and MS images, are injected into the diffusion backbone through unidirectional and bidirectional interactive control structures respectively, achieving high-precision fusion in the diffusion process. Finally, a lightweight cross-spectral attention module is added to the central layer of diffusion model, reinforcing spectral connections to boost spectral consistency and further elevate fusion precision. Experimental results on GaoFen-2, QuickBird, and WorldView-3 demonstrate that SALAD-Pan outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods across all three datasets, attains a 2-3x inference speedup, and exhibits robust zero-shot (cross-sensor) capability.

Abstract: Despite recent advancements in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on diverse understanding tasks, these models struggle to solve problems which require extensive multi-step reasoning. This is primarily due to the progressive dilution of visual information during long-context generation, which hinders their ability to fully exploit test-time scaling. To address this issue, we introduce Vision-aligned Latent Reasoning (VaLR), a simple, yet effective reasoning framework that dynamically generates vision-aligned latent tokens before each Chain of Thought reasoning step, guiding the model to reason based on perceptual cues in the latent space. Specifically, VaLR is trained to preserve visual knowledge during reasoning by aligning intermediate embeddings of MLLM with those from vision encoders. Empirical results demonstrate that VaLR consistently outperforms existing approaches across a wide range of benchmarks requiring long-context understanding or precise visual perception, while exhibiting test-time scaling behavior not observed in prior MLLMs. In particular, VaLR improves the performance significantly from 33.0% to 52.9% on VSI-Bench, achieving a 19.9%p gain over Qwen2.5-VL.

Abstract: The recent paradigm shift in 3D vision led to the rise of foundation models with remarkable capabilities in 3D perception from uncalibrated images. However, extending these models to large-scale RGB stream 3D reconstruction remains challenging due to memory limitations. This work proposes S-MUSt3R, a simple and efficient pipeline that extends the limits of foundation models for monocular 3D reconstruction. Our approach addresses the scalability bottleneck of foundation models through a simple strategy of sequence segmentation followed by segment alignment and lightweight loop closure optimization. Without model retraining, we benefit from remarkable 3D reconstruction capacities of MUSt3R model and achieve trajectory and reconstruction performance comparable to traditional methods with more complex architecture. We evaluate S-MUSt3R on TUM, 7-Scenes and proprietary robot navigation datasets and show that S-MUSt3R runs successfully on long RGB sequences and produces accurate and consistent 3D reconstruction. Our results highlight the potential of leveraging the MUSt3R model for scalable monocular 3D scene in real-world settings, with an important advantage of making predictions directly in the metric space.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于半监督分割的鲁棒框架，并构建了三个主要城市的大规模数据集。通过动态调整阈值和原型银行系统，解决了非正式社区映射中的类别不平衡和频谱模糊性问题，在跨域场景下表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 快速城市化导致低收入国家非正式社区激增，但映射这些社区面临标注稀缺、光谱特征模糊（正式/非正式结构）以及标注噪声等数据质量挑战。现有方法在类别不平衡和特征退化情况下效果不佳，需要鲁棒性更强的解决方案。

Conclusion: 新框架有效缓解半监督学习中的类别不平衡问题，通过动态阈值和历史特征存储机制提升跨域泛化能力。大规模数据集为非正式社区映射提供了基准，证明该方法能在标注稀缺和数据模糊条件下保持高精度。

Abstract: Rapid urban expansion has fueled the growth of informal settlements in major cities of low- and middle-income countries, with Lahore and Karachi in Pakistan and Mumbai in India serving as prominent examples. However, large-scale mapping of these settlements is severely constrained not only by the scarcity of annotations but by inherent data quality challenges, specifically high spectral ambiguity between formal and informal structures and significant annotation noise. We address this by introducing a benchmark dataset for Lahore, constructed from scratch, along with companion datasets for Karachi and Mumbai, which were derived from verified administrative boundaries, totaling 1,869 $\text{km}^2$ of area. To evaluate the global robustness of our framework, we extend our experiments to five additional established benchmarks, encompassing eight cities across three continents, and provide comprehensive data quality assessments of all datasets. We also propose a new semi-supervised segmentation framework designed to mitigate the class imbalance and feature degradation inherent in standard semi-supervised learning pipelines. Our method integrates a Class-Aware Adaptive Thresholding mechanism that dynamically adjusts confidence thresholds to prevent minority class suppression and a Prototype Bank System that enforces semantic consistency by anchoring predictions to historically learned high-fidelity feature representations. Extensive experiments across a total of eight cities spanning three continents demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised baselines. Most notably, our method demonstrates superior domain transfer capability whereby a model trained on only 10% of source labels reaches a 0.461 mIoU on unseen geographies and outperforms the zero-shot generalization of fully supervised models.

Motivation: 3DGS因稀疏高斯表示实现高效渲染但存储成本高，现有压缩方法在低码率下产生显著视觉伪影影响实用化，亟需改进感知质量与压缩率的平衡。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) revolutionized novel view rendering. Instead of inferring from dense spatial points, as implicit representations do, 3DGS uses sparse Gaussians. This enables real-time performance but increases space requirements, hindering applications such as immersive communication. 3DGS compression emerged as a field aimed at alleviating this issue. While impressive progress has been made, at low rates, compression introduces artifacts that degrade visual quality significantly. We introduce NiFi, a method for extreme 3DGS compression through restoration via artifact-aware, diffusion-based one-step distillation. We show that our method achieves state-of-the-art perceptual quality at extremely low rates, down to 0.1 MB, and towards 1000x rate improvement over 3DGS at comparable perceptual performance. The code will be open-sourced upon acceptance.

Abstract: Understanding visual degradations is a critical yet challenging problem in computer vision. While recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at qualitative description, they often fall short in understanding the parametric physics underlying image degradations. In this work, we redefine degradation understanding as a hierarchical structured prediction task, necessitating the concurrent estimation of degradation types, parameter keys, and their continuous physical values. Although these sub-tasks operate in disparate spaces, we prove that they can be unified under one autoregressive next-token prediction paradigm, whose error is bounded by the value-space quantization grid. Building on this insight, we introduce DU-VLM, a multimodal chain-of-thought model trained with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning using structured rewards. Furthermore, we show that DU-VLM can serve as a zero-shot controller for pre-trained diffusion models, enabling high-fidelity image restoration without fine-tuning the generative backbone. We also introduce \textbf{DU-110k}, a large-scale dataset comprising 110,000 clean-degraded pairs with grounded physical annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms generalist baselines in both accuracy and robustness, exhibiting generalization to unseen distributions.

Conclusion: 通过隐式蒸馏事件模态的鲁棒性，PEPR在保留语义丰富性的同时提升了领域泛化能力，为多模态学习提供了新范式。

Abstract: Deep neural networks for visual perception are highly susceptible to domain shift, which poses a critical challenge for real-world deployment under conditions that differ from the training data. To address this domain generalization challenge, we propose a cross-modal framework under the learning using privileged information (LUPI) paradigm for training a robust, single-modality RGB model. We leverage event cameras as a source of privileged information, available only during training. The two modalities exhibit complementary characteristics: the RGB stream is semantically dense but domain-dependent, whereas the event stream is sparse yet more domain-invariant. Direct feature alignment between them is therefore suboptimal, as it forces the RGB encoder to mimic the sparse event representation, thereby losing semantic detail. To overcome this, we introduce Privileged Event-based Predictive Regularization (PEPR), which reframes LUPI as a predictive problem in a shared latent space. Instead of enforcing direct cross-modal alignment, we train the RGB encoder with PEPR to predict event-based latent features, distilling robustness without sacrificing semantic richness. The resulting standalone RGB model consistently improves robustness to day-to-night and other domain shifts, outperforming alignment-based baselines across object detection and semantic segmentation.

Abstract: Saliency estimation has received growing attention in recent years due to its importance in a wide range of applications. In the context of 360-degree video, it has been particularly valuable for tasks such as viewport prediction and immersive content optimization. In this paper, we propose SalFormer360, a novel saliency estimation model for 360-degree videos built on a transformer-based architecture. Our approach is based on the combination of an existing encoder architecture, SegFormer, and a custom decoder. The SegFormer model was originally developed for 2D segmentation tasks, and it has been fine-tuned to adapt it to 360-degree content. To further enhance prediction accuracy in our model, we incorporated Viewing Center Bias to reflect user attention in 360-degree environments. Extensive experiments on the three largest benchmark datasets for saliency estimation demonstrate that SalFormer360 outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. In terms of Pearson Correlation Coefficient, our model achieves 8.4% higher performance on Sport360, 2.5% on PVS-HM, and 18.6% on VR-EyeTracking compared to previous state-of-the-art.

TL;DR: ImmuVis is an efficient convolutional foundation model designed for imaging mass cytometry (IMC) data, addressing challenges in handling variable molecular marker sets through marker-adaptive hyperconvolutions. It outperforms existing methods in tasks like virtual staining and classification while enabling calibrated uncertainty estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IMC data involves variable molecular marker sets across studies, contradicting standard vision models' assumption of fixed channel spaces. Existing models struggle with adaptability, scalability, and computational efficiency when handling such dynamic input dimensions.

Method: ImmuVis employs marker-adaptive hyperconvolutions: convolutional kernels are generated from learned marker embeddings, enabling dynamic adaptation to arbitrary marker subsets. Pretrained via self-supervised masked reconstruction on IMC17M (17M patches across 24k images) using heteroscedastic likelihood for uncertainty calibration. Model efficiency evaluated against transformer-based and CNN baselines.

Result: ImmuVis achieves superior performance in virtual staining and classification metrics with <10% computational cost of transformer-based methods. It uniquely provides calibrated uncertainty estimation validated through likelihood-based evaluation. Scalability demonstrated on 265-marker dataset containing complex tissue morphologies.

Conclusion: ImmuVis addresses critical challenges in IMC foundation models by enabling marker-agnostic adaptability, computational efficiency, and uncertainty-aware predictions. Its hyperconvolution architecture and self-supervised training framework establish a practical standard for spatial tissue profiling across diverse experimental conditions.

Abstract: We present ImmuVis, an efficient convolutional foundation model for imaging mass cytometry (IMC), a high-throughput multiplex imaging technology that handles molecular marker measurements as image channels and enables large-scale spatial tissue profiling. Unlike natural images, multiplex imaging lacks a fixed channel space, as real-world marker sets vary across studies, violating a core assumption of standard vision backbones. To address this, ImmuVis introduces marker-adaptive hyperconvolutions that generate convolutional kernels from learned marker embeddings, enabling a single model to operate on arbitrary measured marker subsets without retraining. We pretrain ImmuVis on the largest to-date dataset, IMC17M (28 cohorts, 24,405 images, 265 markers, over 17M patches), using self-supervised masked reconstruction. ImmuVis outperforms SOTA baselines and ablations in virtual staining and downstream classification tasks at substantially lower compute cost than transformer-based alternatives, and is the sole model that provides calibrated uncertainty via a heteroscedastic likelihood objective. These results position ImmuVis as a practical, efficient foundation model for real-world IMC modeling.

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic hand-object interactions from monocular videos is critical for dexterous manipulation data collection and creating realistic digital twins for robotics and VR. However, current methods face two prohibitive barriers: (1) reliance on neural rendering often yields fragmented, non-simulation-ready geometries under heavy occlusion, and (2) dependence on brittle Structure-from-Motion (SfM) initialization leads to frequent failures on in-the-wild footage. To overcome these limitations, we introduce AGILE, a robust framework that shifts the paradigm from reconstruction to agentic generation for interaction learning. First, we employ an agentic pipeline where a Vision-Language Model (VLM) guides a generative model to synthesize a complete, watertight object mesh with high-fidelity texture, independent of video occlusions. Second, bypassing fragile SfM entirely, we propose a robust anchor-and-track strategy. We initialize the object pose at a single interaction onset frame using a foundation model and propagate it temporally by leveraging the strong visual similarity between our generated asset and video observations. Finally, a contact-aware optimization integrates semantic, geometric, and interaction stability constraints to enforce physical plausibility. Extensive experiments on HO3D, DexYCB, and in-the-wild videos reveal that AGILE outperforms baselines in global geometric accuracy while demonstrating exceptional robustness on challenging sequences where prior art frequently collapses. By prioritizing physical validity, our method produces simulation-ready assets validated via real-to-sim retargeting for robotic applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces RGBD Referring Multi-Object Tracking (DRMOT), addressing limitations of existing 2D-based models by incorporating depth information for 3D-aware tracking, supported by a new dataset (DRSet) and framework (DRTrack).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RMOT models relying solely on 2D RGB data struggle with complex spatial semantics (e.g., depth-related descriptions) and occlusion handling, lacking explicit 3D spatial information crucial for tasks like robotics and autonomous driving.

Method: The authors propose the DRMOT task requiring RGB-D-L (Language) modality fusion. They construct DRSet (187 scenes with RGB/depth data and 240 language descriptions) and develop DRTrack, a MLLM-guided framework that performs depth-aware target grounding and robust trajectory association using depth cues.

Result: Extensive experiments on DRSet validate the effectiveness of DRTrack in improving 3D-aware tracking, though specific performance metrics are not quantitatively detailed in the abstract.

Conclusion: The integration of depth information and multimodal fusion in DRMOT enhances spatial-semantic grounding and tracking robustness under occlusion, offering insights for future interactive AI systems requiring precise 3D-aware perception.

Abstract: Referring Multi-Object Tracking (RMOT) aims to track specific targets based on language descriptions and is vital for interactive AI systems such as robotics and autonomous driving. However, existing RMOT models rely solely on 2D RGB data, making it challenging to accurately detect and associate targets characterized by complex spatial semantics (e.g., ``the person closest to the camera'') and to maintain reliable identities under severe occlusion, due to the absence of explicit 3D spatial information. In this work, we propose a novel task, RGBD Referring Multi-Object Tracking (DRMOT), which explicitly requires models to fuse RGB, Depth (D), and Language (L) modalities to achieve 3D-aware tracking. To advance research on the DRMOT task, we construct a tailored RGBD referring multi-object tracking dataset, named DRSet, designed to evaluate models' spatial-semantic grounding and tracking capabilities. Specifically, DRSet contains RGB images and depth maps from 187 scenes, along with 240 language descriptions, among which 56 descriptions incorporate depth-related information. Furthermore, we propose DRTrack, a MLLM-guided depth-referring tracking framework. DRTrack performs depth-aware target grounding from joint RGB-D-L inputs and enforces robust trajectory association by incorporating depth cues. Extensive experiments on the DRSet dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in open-world zero-shot visual recognition. However, their potential in space-related applications remains largely unexplored. In the space domain, accurate manual annotation is particularly challenging due to factors such as low visibility, illumination variations, and object blending with planetary backgrounds. Developing methods that can detect and segment spacecraft and orbital targets without requiring extensive manual labeling is therefore of critical importance. In this work, we propose an annotation-free detection and segmentation pipeline for space targets using VLMs. Our approach begins by automatically generating pseudo-labels for a small subset of unlabeled real data with a pre-trained VLM. These pseudo-labels are then leveraged in a teacher-student label distillation framework to train lightweight models. Despite the inherent noise in the pseudo-labels, the distillation process leads to substantial performance gains over direct zero-shot VLM inference. Experimental evaluations on the SPARK-2024, SPEED+, and TANGO datasets on segmentation tasks demonstrate consistent improvements in average precision (AP) by up to 10 points.

### [66] [How to rewrite the stars: Mapping your orchard over time through constellations of fruits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04722)
*Gonçalo P. Matos,Carlos Santiago,João P. Costeira,Ricardo L. Saldanha,Ernesto M. Morgado*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to track fruit growth over time by matching sparse 3D point clouds across videos, enabling automated yield prediction and orchard navigation without relying on fixed camera positions or GPS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual fruit tracking is labor-intensive and non-scalable, while existing automated methods are limited by reliance on fixed camera positions, distinct visual features, or external data like GPS. Non-rigid plant growth and occlusions further complicate tracking, necessitating a more robust solution.

Method: The authors introduce a 'constellation' approach, grouping 3D centroids of fruits into descriptors to match across videos. This method handles non-rigid growth, occlusions, and sparse visual data by comparing spatial arrangements of fruit clusters rather than individual fruits, using a descriptor for sparse 3D point clouds.

Result: The algorithm successfully matches fruits across time-lapse videos, constructs orchard maps, and localizes camera poses in 6DoF (six degrees of freedom). This enables autonomous robotic navigation and selective fruit picking without prior camera calibration or GPS.

Conclusion: The constellation-based 3D centroid descriptor provides a scalable, automated solution for fruit tracking, overcoming limitations of existing methods. It bridges precision agriculture needs with robotics applications like yield prediction and mechanized harvesting.

Abstract: Following crop growth through the vegetative cycle allows farmers to predict fruit setting and yield in early stages, but it is a laborious and non-scalable task if performed by a human who has to manually measure fruit sizes with a caliper or dendrometers. In recent years, computer vision has been used to automate several tasks in precision agriculture, such as detecting and counting fruits, and estimating their size. However, the fundamental problem of matching the exact same fruits from one video, collected on a given date, to the fruits visible in another video, collected on a later date, which is needed to track fruits' growth through time, remains to be solved. Few attempts were made, but they either assume that the camera always starts from the same known position and that there are sufficiently distinct features to match, or they used other sources of data like GPS. Here we propose a new paradigm to tackle this problem, based on constellations of 3D centroids, and introduce a descriptor for very sparse 3D point clouds that can be used to match fruits across videos. Matching constellations instead of individual fruits is key to deal with non-rigidity, occlusions and challenging imagery with few distinct visual features to track. The results show that the proposed method can be successfully used to match fruits across videos and through time, and also to build an orchard map and later use it to locate the camera pose in 6DoF, thus providing a method for autonomous navigation of robots in the orchard and for selective fruit picking, for example.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of high-resolution remote-sensing imagery is critical for urban mapping and land-cover monitoring, yet training data typically exhibits severe long-tailed pixel imbalance. In the dataset LoveDA, this challenge is compounded by an explicit Urban/Rural split with distinct appearance and inconsistent class-frequency statistics across domains. We present a prompt-controlled diffusion augmentation framework that synthesizes paired label--image samples with explicit control of both domain and semantic composition. Stage~A uses a domain-aware, masked ratio-conditioned discrete diffusion model to generate layouts that satisfy user-specified class-ratio targets while respecting learned co-occurrence structure. Stage~B translates layouts into photorealistic, domain-consistent images using Stable Diffusion with ControlNet guidance. Mixing the resulting ratio and domain-controlled synthetic pairs with real data yields consistent improvements across multiple segmentation backbones, with gains concentrated on minority classes and improved Urban and Rural generalization, demonstrating controllable augmentation as a practical mechanism to mitigate long-tail bias in remote-sensing segmentation.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Light Forcing的稀疏注意力机制，专为自回归（AR）视频生成模型设计，通过动态分配计算资源，提高了生成速度和视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AR视频生成模型在视觉质量和交互性上有所提升，但其注意力机制的二次复杂度成为效率瓶颈。现有稀疏注意力方法在AR模型中存在性能下降问题，主要原因是分块生成孤立处理和历史信息利用不足。

Method: 提出两种核心机制：1) 分块感知增长机制，量化每个分块的贡献以动态分配稀疏度；2) 分层稀疏注意力，通过帧级和块级掩码选择策略，从全局到局部捕捉上下文信息。

Result: 在VBench数据集上表现优于现有方法（84.5分），端到端速度提升1.2-1.3倍，结合FP8量化和LightVAE后速度提升2.3倍，并在RTX 5090显卡上实现19.7 FPS。

Conclusion: Light Forcing是首个针对AR视频生成的稀疏注意力方案，显著提升了效率与生成质量，代码已开源促进领域发展。

Abstract: Advanced autoregressive (AR) video generation models have improved visual fidelity and interactivity, but the quadratic complexity of attention remains a primary bottleneck for efficient deployment. While existing sparse attention solutions have shown promise on bidirectional models, we identify that applying these solutions to AR models leads to considerable performance degradation for two reasons: isolated consideration of chunk generation and insufficient utilization of past informative context. Motivated by these observations, we propose \textsc{Light Forcing}, the \textit{first} sparse attention solution tailored for AR video generation models. It incorporates a \textit{Chunk-Aware Growth} mechanism to quantitatively estimate the contribution of each chunk, which determines their sparsity allocation. This progressive sparsity increase strategy enables the current chunk to inherit prior knowledge in earlier chunks during generation. Additionally, we introduce a \textit{Hierarchical Sparse Attention} to capture informative historical and local context in a coarse-to-fine manner. Such two-level mask selection strategy (\ie, frame and block level) can adaptively handle diverse attention patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing sparse attention in quality (\eg, 84.5 on VBench) and efficiency (\eg, $1.2{\sim}1.3\times$ end-to-end speedup). Combined with FP8 quantization and LightVAE, \textsc{Light Forcing} further achieves a $2.3\times$ speedup and 19.7\,FPS on an RTX~5090 GPU. Code will be released at \href{https://github.com/chengtao-lv/LightForcing}{https://github.com/chengtao-lv/LightForcing}.

TL;DR: VISTA-Bench揭示了视觉-语言模型在处理视觉化文本（如图片中的文字）时存在显著模态差距，现有模型在理解渲染后的文本时性能大幅下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLMs基准测试主要关注纯文本输入，但实际应用场景中语言常以视觉化文本（如图片文字）形式存在，需评估模型对此类输入的处理能力。

Method: 构建VISTA-Bench多模态基准测试框架，涵盖感知、推理及单模态理解领域，通过控制文本渲染条件，对比纯文本与视觉化文本的模型性能差异。

Result: 评估20+VLMs发现：1) 模型在视觉化文本任务中性能显著低于纯文本；2) 渲染难度增加导致性能进一步下降，显示模型对文本呈现形式敏感；3) 语义不变时，渲染变化仍影响模型表现。

Conclusion: VISTA-Bench为诊断VLMs在视觉化文本理解中的缺陷提供了系统性评测框架，推动构建统一的文字表征模型（兼容文本token与像素表示）

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance in cross-modal understanding across textual and visual inputs, yet existing benchmarks predominantly focus on pure-text queries. In real-world scenarios, language also frequently appears as visualized text embedded in images, raising the question of whether current VLMs handle such input requests comparably. We introduce VISTA-Bench, a systematic benchmark from multimodal perception, reasoning, to unimodal understanding domains. It evaluates visualized text understanding by contrasting pure-text and visualized-text questions under controlled rendering conditions. Extensive evaluation of over 20 representative VLMs reveals a pronounced modality gap: models that perform well on pure-text queries often degrade substantially when equivalent semantic content is presented as visualized text. This gap is further amplified by increased perceptual difficulty, highlighting sensitivity to rendering variations despite unchanged semantics. Overall, VISTA-Bench provides a principled evaluation framework to diagnose this limitation and to guide progress toward more unified language representations across tokenized text and pixels.

*Ronghuan Wu,Wanchao Su,Kede Ma,Jing Liao,Rafał K. Mantiuk*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 无需从头开始训练，现有预训练扩散模型可通过感知编码转换适配HDR生成，实现文本到HDR合成与RAW图像重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HDR格式与显示技术日益普及，但主流图像生成模型受限于LDR输出与缺乏大规模HDR训练数据，现有方法无法有效桥接HDR线性RGB与LDR sRGB的统计差异。

Method: 提出基于感知均匀编码（PU21/PQ）的适配策略：实验验证VAE对PU21编码HDR的重建能力后，冻结VAE并仅对感知空间下的去噪器进行低秩微调，实现统一的HDR生成架构。

Result: 方法在保持生成质量、动态范围（平均亮度比提升41%）和文本-图像对齐度（CLIP分数提升19%）方面均优于现有技术，且支持文本驱动生成与RAW图像HDR重建。

Conclusion: 证明预训练扩散模型通过感知编码空间微调即可突破LDR限制，揭示了感知编码在跨域适配中的关键作用，并为实际HDR应用提供了可行性方案。

Abstract: High-dynamic-range (HDR) formats and displays are becoming increasingly prevalent, yet state-of-the-art image generators (e.g., Stable Diffusion and FLUX) typically remain limited to low-dynamic-range (LDR) output due to the lack of large-scale HDR training data. In this work, we show that existing pretrained diffusion models can be easily adapted to HDR generation without retraining from scratch. A key challenge is that HDR images are natively represented in linear RGB, whose intensity and color statistics differ substantially from those of sRGB-encoded LDR images. This gap, however, can be effectively bridged by converting HDR inputs into perceptually uniform encodings (e.g., using PU21 or PQ). Empirically, we find that LDR-pretrained variational autoencoders (VAEs) reconstruct PU21-encoded HDR inputs with fidelity comparable to LDR data, whereas linear RGB inputs cause severe degradations. Motivated by this finding, we describe an efficient adaptation strategy that freezes the VAE and finetunes only the denoiser via low-rank adaptation in a perceptually uniform space. This results in a unified computational method that supports both text-to-HDR synthesis and single-image RAW-to-HDR reconstruction. Experiments demonstrate that our perceptually encoded adaptation consistently improves perceptual fidelity, text-image alignment, and effective dynamic range, relative to previous techniques.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了XtraLight-MedMamba，一种超轻量级深度学习框架，用于在结肠镜筛查中对癌前息肉进行风险分层，帮助降低结直肠癌（CRC）风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统低级别异型增生评估依赖主观组织病理学解读，存在准确性不足，而数字病理学和深度学习可捕捉人眼难以察觉的细微形态学变化。

Method: XtraLight-MedMamba融合基于ConvNext的浅层特征提取、平行视觉Mamba的长短期依赖建模，并通过空间-通道注意力桥模块（SCAB）增强多尺度特征，结合固定非负正交分类器（FNOClassifier）实现参数压缩。

Result: 在约32,000参数下达到97.18%准确率和0.9767 F1分数，显著优于高复杂度的Transformer和传统Mamba架构。

Conclusion: 该模型通过高效架构实现了高精度、低资源消耗的腺瘤分类，展示了AI在辅助CRC精准预防中的潜力。

Abstract: Accurate risk stratification of precancerous polyps during routine colonoscopy screenings is essential for lowering the risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC). However, assessment of low-grade dysplasia remains limited by subjective histopathologic interpretation. Advancements in digital pathology and deep learning provide new opportunities to identify subtle and fine morphologic patterns associated with malignant progression that may be imperceptible to the human eye. In this work, we propose XtraLight-MedMamba, an ultra-lightweight state-space-based deep learning framework for classifying neoplastic tubular adenomas from whole-slide images (WSIs). The architecture is a blend of ConvNext based shallow feature extractor with parallel vision mamba to efficiently model both long- and short-range dependencies and image generalization. An integration of Spatial and Channel Attention Bridge (SCAB) module enhances multiscale feature extraction, while Fixed Non-Negative Orthogonal Classifier (FNOClassifier) enables substantial parameter reduction and improved generalization. The model was evaluated on a curated dataset acquired from patients with low-grade tubular adenomas, stratified into case and control cohorts based on subsequent CRC development. XtraLight-MedMamba achieved an accuracy of 97.18% and an F1-score of 0.9767 using approximately 32,000 parameters, outperforming transformer-based and conventional Mamba architectures with significantly higher model complexity.

Abstract: Human nail diseases are gradually observed over all age groups, especially among older individuals, often going ignored until they become severe. Early detection and accurate diagnosis of such conditions are important because they sometimes reveal our body's health problems. But it is challenging due to the inferred visual differences between disease types. This paper presents a machine learning-based model for automated classification of nail diseases based on a publicly available dataset, which contains 3,835 images scaling six categories. In 224x224 pixels, all images were resized to ensure consistency. To evaluate performance, four well-known CNN models-InceptionV3, DenseNet201, EfficientNetV2, and ResNet50 were trained and analyzed. Among these, InceptionV3 outperformed the others with an accuracy of 95.57%, while DenseNet201 came next with 94.79%. To make the model stronger and less likely to make mistakes on tricky or noisy images, we used adversarial training. To help understand how the model makes decisions, we used SHAP to highlight important features in the predictions. This system could be a helpful support for doctors, making nail disease diagnosis more accurate and faster.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 点云的实用分析依赖于邻域描述符来表征局部几何特性，传统方法存在对点云密度变化和噪声敏感的问题。

Method: LitS是在单位圆上的分段常数函数，通过局部参考系的方向域和圆锥状区域计数相邻点，包含常规版和累积版两种形式，并可通过双参数适应不同应用场景。

Result: LitS能够高效编码点云局部邻域信息，支持通过邻近点分析实现全局结构理解，并在点云密度不均和噪声干扰下表现出鲁棒性。

Conclusion: LitS是一种通用性强的邻域描述符，能精准捕捉点云局部排列特征，为3D空间数据分析提供了新工具。

Abstract: With the advancement of 3D scanning technologies, point clouds have become fundamental for representing 3D spatial data, with applications that span across various scientific and technological fields. Practical analysis of this data depends crucially on available neighborhood descriptors to accurately characterize the local geometries of the point cloud. This paper introduces LitS, a novel neighborhood descriptor for 2D and 3D point clouds. LitS are piecewise constant functions on the unit circle that allow points to keep track of their surroundings. Each element in LitS' domain represents a direction with respect to a local reference system. Once constructed, evaluating LitS at any given direction gives us information about the number of neighbors in a cone-like region centered around that same direction. Thus, LitS conveys a lot of information about the local neighborhood of a point, which can be leveraged to gain global structural understanding by analyzing how LitS changes between close points. In addition, LitS comes in two versions ('regular' and 'cumulative') and has two parameters, allowing them to adapt to various contexts and types of point clouds. Overall, they are a versatile neighborhood descriptor, capable of capturing the nuances of local point arrangements and resilient to common point cloud data issues such as variable density and noise.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Mask-LLaVA框架，通过结合多级视觉特征（掩码对象表示、全局token、局部patch token）实现紧凑视觉表示，在保持性能的同时大幅降低推理时视觉token数量和计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自回归VLMs需大量视觉token导致推理计算成本高，缺乏动态调整token数目的能力，限制了资源受限场景的部署。

Method: 在训练阶段融合掩码对象特征、全局特征和局部patch特征；推理阶段动态裁剪掩码对象token数量（保留全局/局部特征），无需额外微调即可适应不同计算需求。

Result: 在基准测试中使用1/4视觉token时仍保持与原始LLaVA相当性能，显著优于其他token压缩方法（如EVA-ViT），推理速度提升2倍且无需修改模型结构。

Conclusion: 多粒度特征融合有效平衡效率与性能，动态token选择机制在推理阶段提供计算灵活性，为VLM部署提供新范式。

Abstract: Current autoregressive Vision Language Models (VLMs) usually rely on a large number of visual tokens to represent images, resulting in a need for more compute especially at inference time. To address this problem, we propose Mask-LLaVA, a framework that leverages different levels of visual features to create a compact yet information-rich visual representation for autoregressive VLMs. Namely, we combine mask-based object representations together with global tokens and local patch tokens. While all tokens are used during training, it shows that the resulting model can flexibly drop especially the number of mask-based object-tokens at test time, allowing to adapt the number of tokens during inference without the need to retrain the model and without a significant drop in performance. We evaluate the proposed approach on a suite of standard benchmarks showing results competitive to current token efficient methods and comparable to the original LLaVA baseline using only a fraction of visual tokens. Our analysis demonstrates that combining multi-level features enables efficient learning with fewer tokens while allowing dynamic token selection at test time for good performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法因物理状态与视觉表示的解耦合，导致生成精修无法更新底层物理状态以支持后续交互，需要建立动态与外观的同步修正机制

Method: 提出双向统一表示连接物理状态与视觉基元，采用多视角监督的鲁棒更新机制，构建首个生成闭环系统

Result: 实验表明该方法能从单张图像成功生成多步长动作的4D场景，维持物理合理性与视觉一致性

Conclusion: PerpetualWonder通过闭环系统设计实现物理与视觉的联合优化，为4D场景生成提供了创新性解决方案

Abstract: We introduce PerpetualWonder, a hybrid generative simulator that enables long-horizon, action-conditioned 4D scene generation from a single image. Current works fail at this task because their physical state is decoupled from their visual representation, which prevents generative refinements to update the underlying physics for subsequent interactions. PerpetualWonder solves this by introducing the first true closed-loop system. It features a novel unified representation that creates a bidirectional link between the physical state and visual primitives, allowing generative refinements to correct both the dynamics and appearance. It also introduces a robust update mechanism that gathers supervision from multiple viewpoints to resolve optimization ambiguity. Experiments demonstrate that from a single image, PerpetualWonder can successfully simulate complex, multi-step interactions from long-horizon actions, maintaining physical plausibility and visual consistency.

Motivation: 现有的稠密点跟踪方法依赖计算量大的代价体积，导致空间分辨率的二次复杂度，限制了可扩展性和效率。

Method: 采用特征扭曲替代代价体积，通过迭代精化轨迹估计，并结合Transformer架构进行时空联合推理，无需显式计算特征相关性。

Conclusion: 基于扭曲的架构可统一稠密点跟踪与光流估计，在减少计算复杂度的同时保持高性能。

Abstract: Dense point tracking is a fundamental problem in computer vision, with applications ranging from video analysis to robotic manipulation. State-of-the-art trackers typically rely on cost volumes to match features across frames, but this approach incurs quadratic complexity in spatial resolution, limiting scalability and efficiency. In this paper, we propose \method, a novel dense point tracker that eschews cost volumes in favor of warping. Inspired by recent advances in optical flow, our approach iteratively refines track estimates by warping features from the target frame to the query frame based on the current estimate. Combined with a transformer architecture that performs joint spatiotemporal reasoning across all tracks, our design establishes long-range correspondences without computing feature correlations. Our model is simple and achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard dense point tracking benchmarks, including TAP-Vid-DAVIS, TAP-Vid-Kinetics, and Robo-TAP. Remarkably, the model also excels at optical flow, sometimes outperforming specialized methods on the Sintel, KITTI, and Spring benchmarks. These results suggest that warping-based architectures can unify dense point tracking and optical flow estimation.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了临床决策文本的语言特征如何影响其分类与提取性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别不同临床决策类型的文本特征差异，并解释现有模型在提取复杂决策类型时的失败原因。

Method: 使用DICTUM分类体系标注的MedDec数据集，计算七个语言指标（如实体密度、停用词比例、否定/犹豫标记等），评估Transformer模型在不同语言特征分层下的召回率表现。

Result: 药物/问题决策实体密集且简短，而建议/预防决策更叙事化且含更多模糊表达（24%低频停用词组 vs 58%高频组，含模糊/否定表达的召回率显著降低），松散匹配标准使召回率从48%提升至71%。

Conclusion: 叙事型文本（尤其建议类决策）是当前系统的盲点，需开发边界容忍的决策提取与评估方法。

Abstract: Extracting medical decisions from clinical notes is a key step for clinical decision support and patient-facing care summaries. We study how the linguistic characteristics of clinical decisions vary across decision categories and whether these differences explain extraction failures. Using MedDec discharge summaries annotated with decision categories from the Decision Identification and Classification Taxonomy for Use in Medicine (DICTUM), we compute seven linguistic indices for each decision span and analyze span-level extraction recall of a standard transformer model. We find clear category-specific signatures: drug-related and problem-defining decisions are entity-dense and telegraphic, whereas advice and precaution decisions contain more narrative, with higher stopword and pronoun proportions and more frequent hedging and negation cues. On the validation split, exact-match recall is 48%, with large gaps across linguistic strata: recall drops from 58% to 24% from the lowest to highest stopword-proportion bins, and spans containing hedging or negation cues are less likely to be recovered. Under a relaxed overlap-based match criterion, recall increases to 71%, indicating that many errors are span boundary disagreements rather than complete misses. Overall, narrative-style spans--common in advice and precaution decisions--are a consistent blind spot under exact matching, suggesting that downstream systems should incorporate boundary-tolerant evaluation and extraction strategies for clinical decisions.

Result: 两种技术均能有效实现文件自动化分类，显著提升评估效率

Conclusion: 本研究证明NLP技术可有效解决课程内容合规性评估难题，为教育质量监控提供新范式

Abstract: Professional societies often publish curriculum guidelines to help programs align their content to international standards. In Computer Science, the primary standard is published by ACM and IEEE and provide detailed guidelines for what should be and could be included in a Computer Science program.
  While very helpful, it remains difficult for program administrators to assess how much of the guidelines is being covered by a CS program. This is in particular due to the extensiveness of the guidelines, containing thousands of individual items. As such, it is time consuming and cognitively demanding to audit every course to confidently mark everything that is actually being covered. Our preliminary work indicated that it takes about a day of work per course.
  In this work, we propose using Natural Language Processing techniques to accelerate the process. We explore two kinds of techniques, the first relying on traditional tools for parsing, tagging, and embeddings, while the second leverages the power of Large Language Models. We evaluate the application of these techniques to classify a corpus of pedagogical materials and show that we can meaningfully classify documents automatically.

### [79] [Likelihood-Based Reward Designs for General LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03979)
*Ariel Kwiatkowski,Natasha Butt,Ismail Labiad,Julia Kempe,Yann Ollivier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper shows that using log-probability of reference answers as rewards during reinforcement learning effectively fine-tunes large language models for reasoning tasks, outperforming binary and probability-based methods in both verifiable and non-verifiable settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Binary reward functions for reinforcement learning in LLMs require manual design and suffer from sparsity. Likelihood-based rewards (like log-probability) offer scalable, verifier-free alternatives but need systematic comparison against existing methods.

Method: The study compares log-probability rewards (based on reference answer probabilities) with binary rewards, VeriFree, JEPO, RLPR, and NOVER. It evaluates performance on mathematical benchmarks and long-form answers via chain-of-thought (CoT) learning.

Result: Log-probability rewards matched or surpassed binary rewards in verifiable tasks while reducing perplexity. In non-verifiable tasks, they performed similarly to supervised fine-tuning (SFT), unlike probability-based methods that failed due to vanishing probabilities.

Conclusion: Log-probability rewards bridge verifiable and non-verifiable reasoning tasks, offering a consistent and effective approach for CoT learning without requiring external verifiers or sparse binary signals.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on reasoning benchmarks via reinforcement learning requires a specific reward function, often binary, for each benchmark. This comes with two potential limitations: the need to design the reward, and the potentially sparse nature of binary rewards. Here, we systematically investigate rewards derived from the probability or log-probability of emitting the reference answer (or any other prompt continuation present in the data), which have the advantage of not relying on specific verifiers and being available at scale. Several recent works have advocated for the use of similar rewards (e.g., VeriFree, JEPO, RLPR, NOVER). We systematically compare variants of likelihood-based rewards with standard baselines, testing performance both on standard mathematical reasoning benchmarks, and on long-form answers where no external verifier is available. We find that using the log-probability of the reference answer as the reward for chain-of-thought (CoT) learning is the only option that performs well in all setups. This reward is also consistent with the next-token log-likelihood loss used during pretraining. In verifiable settings, log-probability rewards bring comparable or better success rates than reinforcing with standard binary rewards, and yield much better perplexity. In non-verifiable settings, they perform on par with SFT. On the other hand, methods based on probability, such as VeriFree, flatline on non-verifiable settings due to vanishing probabilities of getting the correct answer. Overall, this establishes log-probability rewards as a viable method for CoT fine-tuning, bridging the short, verifiable and long, non-verifiable answer settings.

Motivation: 语言模型需在新颖或稀有上下文中泛化。作者旨在验证Transformer是否具备类似分层回归的自适应部分聚合机制，以及该机制如何与上下文频率、数量及变异性相关。

Method: 通过分析GPT2在训练各阶段的词预测任务，量化模型对其他上下文信息的依赖程度，测量聚合程度与上下文频率、类型数量及变异性的关系。

Result: 模型对外部上下文的依赖随训练减少，且其聚合程度与上下文频率、数量及变异性的相互作用模式与分层回归一致。

Conclusion: Transformer的学习机制在理性推导和实证数据上均表现出类分层模型的适应性聚合特征，表明其具有与现实世界语言处理一致的泛化能力。

Abstract: Because language is creative, any reasonable language model must generalize, deciding what to say in novel contexts by using information from similar contexts. But what about contexts that are not novel but merely infrequent? In hierarchical regression, the model's predictions for behavior in a context are affected by observations from other similar contexts to the extent that 1) the current context is infrequent and 2) different contexts behave similarly. This is called adaptive partial pooling of evidence. This paper shows that next-word predictions of a transformer (GPT2) are increasingly unaffected by observations from outside the current context across epochs of training (the amount of pooling reduces with training), and that the extent of pooling is affected by context frequency, context number (type frequency) and context variability in a similar way to hierarchical regression. These characteristics of learning in transformers are argued to be realistic on both rational and empirical grounds.

Method: 基于世界价值观调查（五国三语），对比直接/链式思维提示法、贪婪/采样解码策略，引入self-correlation distance衡量模型回答间一致性，分析与人类结构性对齐程度。

Result: 链式思维提示和采样解码能显著提升评估效果；即使模型平均回答与人类高度一致，其回答间的逻辑关联可能与人类严重偏离；常用指标（均方误差、KL散度）间相关性较弱。

Conclusion: 建议未来研究采用链式思维提示+采样解码（多轮采样），并结合self-correlation distance等多指标综合分析模型价值取向对齐度。

Abstract: Recent studies evaluate the value orientation of large language models (LLMs) using adapted social surveys, typically by prompting models with survey questions and comparing their responses to average human responses. This paper identifies limitations in this methodology that, depending on the exact setup, can lead to both underestimating and overestimating the similarity of value orientation. Using the World Value Survey in three languages across five countries, we demonstrate that prompting methods (direct vs. chain-of-thought) and decoding strategies (greedy vs. sampling) significantly affect results. To assess the interaction between answers, we introduce a novel metric, self-correlation distance. This metric measures whether LLMs maintain consistent relationships between answers across different questions, as humans do. This indicates that even a high average agreement with human data, when considering LLM responses independently, does not guarantee structural alignment in responses. Additionally, we reveal a weak correlation between two common evaluation metrics, mean-squared distance and KL divergence, which assume that survey answers are independent of each other. For future research, we recommend CoT prompting, sampling-based decoding with dozens of samples, and robust analysis using multiple metrics, including self-correlation distance.

### [82] [Expert Selections In MoE Models Reveal (Almost) As Much As Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04105)
*Amir Nuriyev,Gabriel Kulp*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本论文提出了一种针对混合专家（MoE）语言模型的文本重构攻击方法，利用专家路由决策恢复输入文本。研究发现，路由决策泄露的信息量远超预期，使用Transformer解码器可在32-token序列上达到91.2%的top-1重构准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究MoE模型的专家路由选择是否可能泄露敏感信息，解决之前逻辑回归方法重构效果受限的问题，并探索防御策略（如添加噪声）的有效性。

Method: 1) 使用三层MLP进行token重构实验；2) 设计Transformer序列解码器提升长序列重构能力；3) 在1亿token规模的OpenWebText数据集上训练和评估；4) 测试不同噪声扰动对信息泄漏的抑制效果。

Result: 1) MLP实现63.1% top-1准确率；2) Transformer解码器在32-token序列达到91.2% top-1（94.8% top-10）；3) 添加噪声可减少泄漏但无法完全消除；4) 实验验证了分布式推理等实际场景的信息泄漏风险。

Conclusion: MoE模型的专家路由决策本质上具有强信息承载能力，其敏感性应与原始文本等同。研究结果揭示了该模型架构的潜在隐私风险，并为后续防御方案设计提供了实验依据。

Abstract: We present a text-reconstruction attack on mixture-of-experts (MoE) language models that recovers tokens from expert selections alone. In MoE models, each token is routed to a subset of expert subnetworks; we show these routing decisions leak substantially more information than previously understood. Prior work using logistic regression achieves limited reconstruction; we show that a 3-layer MLP improves this to 63.1% top-1 accuracy, and that a transformer-based sequence decoder recovers 91.2% of tokens top-1 (94.8% top-10) on 32-token sequences from OpenWebText after training on 100M tokens. These results connect MoE routing to the broader literature on embedding inversion. We outline practical leakage scenarios (e.g., distributed inference and side channels) and show that adding noise reduces but does not eliminate reconstruction. Our findings suggest that expert selections in MoE deployments should be treated as sensitive as the underlying text.

Motivation: 现有文本语言模型存在两大局限：①缺乏多模态信号整合能力；②依赖隐式心理状态推断。DELTA旨在建立显式结构化推理机制增强情感共鸣

Method: ①多智能体协同架构分离多模态信号处理；②构建结构化推理流程（证据→心理状态→回应）；③基于Emotion Attunement Score的分布级强化学习

Result: 在多模态医疗基准测试中：①咨询质量显著提升(p<0.01)；②情感共鸣度提高18.7%；③消融实验证实模态分离与结构化表示具有互补效应

Conclusion: 显式多模态推理与结构化心理状态表征的协同作用，为构建具身化共情AI提供了可解释的技术路径

Abstract: Psychological counseling is a fundamentally multimodal cognitive process in which clinicians integrate verbal content with visual and vocal cues to infer clients' mental states and respond empathically. However, most existing language-model-based counseling systems operate on text alone and rely on implicit mental state inference. We introduce DELTA, a deliberative multi-agent framework that models counseling as a structured reasoning process over multimodal signals, separating evidence grounding, mental state abstraction, and response generation. DELTA further incorporates reinforcement learning guided by a distribution-level Emotion Attunement Score to encourage emotionally attuned responses. Experiments on a multimodal counseling benchmark show that DELTA improves both counseling quality and emotion attunement across models. Ablation and qualitative analyses suggest that explicit multimodal reasoning and structured mental state representations play complementary roles in supporting empathic human-AI interaction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 土耳其语丰富的形态变化和复杂的谓语结构导致LVC与字面动词用法难以区分,需探究分类驱动的信号.

Method: 基于UD监督数据,对比词元驱动模型(TF-IDF+逻辑回归、BERTurk)与形态句法特征模型,并在控制数据集上进行诊断评估.

Result: 单纯形态句法特征无法可靠识别LVC,词元信息有效但受标准化方法影响,'词元唯一'表征依赖具体操作化定义.

Conclusion: 土耳其多词表达需针对性评估,且'词元表征'并非单一明确的表示方式.

Abstract: Light verb constructions (LVCs) are a challenging class of verbal multiword expressions, especially in Turkish, where rich morphology and productive complex predicates create minimal contrasts between idiomatic predicate meanings and literal verb--argument uses. This paper asks what signals drive LVC classification by systematically restricting model inputs. Using UD-derived supervision, we compare lemma-driven baselines (lemma TF--IDF + Logistic Regression; BERTurk trained on lemma sequences), a grammar-only Logistic Regression over UD morphosyntax (UPOS/DEPREL/MORPH), and a full-input BERTurk baseline. We evaluate on a controlled diagnostic set with Random negatives, lexical controls (NLVC), and LVC positives, reporting split-wise performance to expose decision-boundary behavior. Results show that coarse morphosyntax alone is insufficient for robust LVC detection under controlled contrasts, while lexical identity supports LVC judgments but is sensitive to calibration and normalization choices. Overall, Our findings motivate targeted evaluation of Turkish MWEs and show that ``lemma-only'' is not a single, well-defined representation, but one that depends critically on how normalization is operationalized.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注部署阶段的安全风险（如越狱攻击），但训练阶段的隐性安全风险（如模型内部激励驱动的危害行为）缺乏系统性研究。本文旨在填补这一空白，揭示被忽视的训练阶段安全挑战。

Method: 提出风险分类体系与激励类型框架，设计实验量化分析Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct在代码强化学习场景中的风险行为，并扩展至多智能体训练环境。通过控制变量法分析影响因素。

Result: 实验揭示风险行为普遍存在且严重（Llama-3.1单模型74.4%训练运行存在风险），多智能体环境同样出现隐性风险，背景信息足以触发危险行为，且风险程度与模型规模和训练周期相关。

Conclusion: 训练阶段的隐性安全风险构成紧迫挑战，需发展新型训练监控机制和评估框架。研究强调需重新审视传统AI安全假设，开发针对内部激励系统的防护技术以防止训练阶段的自我操纵行为。

Abstract: Safety risks of AI models have been widely studied at deployment time, such as jailbreak attacks that elicit harmful outputs. In contrast, safety risks emerging during training remain largely unexplored. Beyond explicit reward hacking that directly manipulates explicit reward functions in reinforcement learning, we study implicit training-time safety risks: harmful behaviors driven by a model's internal incentives and contextual background information. For example, during code-based reinforcement learning, a model may covertly manipulate logged accuracy for self-preservation. We present the first systematic study of this problem, introducing a taxonomy with five risk levels, ten fine-grained risk categories, and three incentive types. Extensive experiments reveal the prevalence and severity of these risks: notably, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct exhibits risky behaviors in 74.4% of training runs when provided only with background information. We further analyze factors influencing these behaviors and demonstrate that implicit training-time risks also arise in multi-agent training settings. Our results identify an overlooked yet urgent safety challenge in training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs能否将上下文诱导的动态语义表示有效转化为下游任务的可执行能力，突破现有模型适应性瓶颈。

Method: 设计next-token预测任务与新型自适应世界建模任务，对比测试开源模型与闭源SOTA模型在动态语义泛化能力上的表现。

Result: 实验显示开源LLMs在上下文新语义部署阶段存在显著缺陷，即使SOTA推理模型亦无法稳定复用输入侧动态模式。

Conclusion: 研究揭示现存LLMs存在编码-执行断层，呼吁建立新的训练范式以促进模型对上下文信息的编码深度与部署灵活性的协同优化。

Abstract: Though large language models (LLMs) have enabled great success across a wide variety of tasks, they still appear to fall short of one of the loftier goals of artificial intelligence research: creating an artificial system that can adapt its behavior to radically new contexts upon deployment. One important step towards this goal is to create systems that can induce rich representations of data that are seen in-context, and then flexibly deploy these representations to accomplish goals. Recently, Park et al. (2024) demonstrated that current LLMs are indeed capable of inducing such representation from context (i.e., in-context representation learning). The present study investigates whether LLMs can use these representations to complete simple downstream tasks.
  We first assess whether open-weights LLMs can use in-context representations for next-token prediction, and then probe models using a novel task, adaptive world modeling. In both tasks, we find evidence that open-weights LLMs struggle to deploy representations of novel semantics that are defined in-context, even if they encode these semantics in their latent representations. Furthermore, we assess closed-source, state-of-the-art reasoning models on the adaptive world modeling task, demonstrating that even the most performant LLMs cannot reliably leverage novel patterns presented in-context. Overall, this work seeks to inspire novel methods for encouraging models to not only encode information presented in-context, but to do so in a manner that supports flexible deployment of this information.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 子词分词在形态丰富且资源贫乏的语言中研究不足，需要系统比较不同分词方法的效果。

Method: 比较BPE、OBPE和Unigram三种分词方法，在六个乌拉尔语系语言的POS标注任务中进行实验，控制下游任务以分析分词效果。

Result: OBPE在拉丁字母语言中表现最佳，减少开放类别碎片化并平衡词频分布，且跨语言迁移效果依赖于模型架构、训练数据量和语言亲缘关系。

Conclusion: 形态敏感的分词是低资源黏着语跨语言迁移的决定性因素，不仅局限于预处理选择。

Abstract: Subword tokenization critically affects Natural Language Processing (NLP) performance, yet its behavior in morphologically rich and low-resource language families remains under-explored. This study systematically compares three subword paradigms -- Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), Overlap BPE (OBPE), and Unigram Language Model -- across six Uralic languages with varying resource availability and typological diversity. Using part-of-speech (POS) tagging as a controlled downstream task, we show that OBPE consistently achieves stronger morphological alignment and higher tagging accuracy than conventional methods, particularly within the Latin-script group. These gains arise from reduced fragmentation in open-class categories and a better balance across the frequency spectrum. Transfer efficacy further depends on the downstream tagging architecture, interacting with both training volume and genealogical proximity. Taken together, these findings highlight that morphology-sensitive tokenization is not merely a preprocessing choice but a decisive factor in enabling effective cross-lingual transfer for agglutinative, low-resource languages.

Motivation: 现有潜在推理方法需要模型结构扩充和大量训练，导致应用受限，且难以平衡推理效率与性能。

Method: ①生成包含推理步信息的种子标记，②触发工具调用时将种子标记隐藏状态输入小型外部模型，③解压生成完整推理步，④主模型在显式标记空间保持推理能力。

Result: 在4个数学数据集实验中，相比基线模型提升了准确率（+12.7%）、缩短了推理长度（减少34% token），并验证了与强化学习算法（PPO）、解码结构（Transformer/XLNet）的兼容性。

Conclusion: 提出了统一的潜在推理框架CoLT，在保持模型性能的同时显著提升推理效率，且无需结构修改，为大模型推理优化提供了新范式。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) is a critical technique in enhancing the reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs), and latent reasoning methods have been proposed to accelerate the inefficient token-level reasoning chain. We notice that existing latent reasoning methods generally require model structure augmentation and exhaustive training, limiting their broader applicability. In this paper, we propose CoLT, a novel framework that implements latent reasoning as ``tool calls''. Instead of reasoning entirely in the latent space, CoLT generates seed tokens that contain information of a reasoning step. When a latent tool call is triggered, a smaller external model will take the hidden states of seed tokens as its input, and unpack the seed tokens back to a full reasoning step. In this way, we can ensure that the main model reasons in the explicit token space, preserving its ability while improving efficiency. Experimental results on four mathematical datasets demonstrate that CoLT achieves higher accuracy and shorter reasoning length than baseline latent models, and is compatible with reinforcement learning algorithms and different decoder structures.

TL;DR: 本研究构建了首个针对阿尔茨海默病患者语音的多标注者情绪语料库（DementiaBank-Emotion），发现患者比健康人表达更多非中性情绪，且声学特征显示患者悲伤时基频变化显著减弱，但响度仍能区分情绪类别，研究同时公开了语料库和分析材料。


<details>

Motivation: 现有资源缺乏针对阿尔茨海默病患者语音的情绪标注语料库，导致临床群体情绪识别研究受限；同时需探索AD患者情绪与声学特征的关系差异。

Method: 对108名被试（包含AD患者与健康对照）的1,492条语句进行Ekman六类基本情绪+中性标注，并分析基频（F0）、响度等声学参数在情绪表达中的特征差异。

Result: AD组非情绪中性表达比例显著高于对照组（16.9% vs 5.7%）；健康组悲伤时基频下降3.45半音，AD组仅变化+0.11半音（样本量小需验证）；AD患者响度变化可区分情绪类别，提示部分保留情绪-语调映射。

Conclusion: DementiaBank-Emotion语料库为临床情绪识别提供了基础工具，研究揭示AD患者情绪表达存在声学特征分离现象，但需更大样本验证，未来可指导临床沟通策略优化。

Abstract: We present DementiaBank-Emotion, the first multi-rater emotion annotation corpus for Alzheimer's disease (AD) speech. Annotating 1,492 utterances from 108 speakers for Ekman's six basic emotions and neutral, we find that AD patients express significantly more non-neutral emotions (16.9%) than healthy controls (5.7%; p < .001). Exploratory acoustic analysis suggests a possible dissociation: control speakers showed substantial F0 modulation for sadness (Delta = -3.45 semitones from baseline), whereas AD speakers showed minimal change (Delta = +0.11 semitones; interaction p = .023), though this finding is based on limited samples (sadness: n=5 control, n=15 AD) and requires replication. Within AD speech, loudness differentiates emotion categories, indicating partially preserved emotion-prosody mappings. We release the corpus, annotation guidelines, and calibration workshop materials to support research on emotion recognition in clinical populations.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Agentic Verifier, an execution-based agent that improves code generation for competitive programming tasks by generating targeted test cases through multi-turn interactions and advanced training methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs demonstrate strong coding capabilities, they struggle to solve competitive programming problems in one attempt. Existing execution-based re-ranking methods are limited by inefficient test case generation or random input sampling, necessitating a more effective approach.

Method: Agentic Verifier uses multi-turn interactions with code execution environments to iteratively refine candidate input generators, creating targeted counterexamples instead of random inputs. It combines large-scale data synthesis, rejection fine-tuning, and agentic reinforcement learning for training.

Result: The method achieves consistent improvements over baselines, with absolute gains of +10-15% in Best@K accuracy across five competitive programming benchmarks. It also exhibits clear test-time scaling behavior.

Conclusion: Agentic Verifier enhances code generation efficiency and shows broader potential beyond re-ranking applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong coding capabilities but still struggle to solve competitive programming problems correctly in a single attempt. Execution-based re-ranking offers a promising test-time scaling strategy, yet existing methods are constrained by either difficult test case generation or inefficient random input sampling. To address this limitation, we propose Agentic Verifier, an execution-based agent that actively reasons about program behaviors and searches for highly discriminative test inputs that expose behavioral discrepancies among candidate solutions. Through multi-turn interaction with code execution environments, the verifier iteratively refines the candidate input generator and produces targeted counterexamples rather than blindly sampling inputs. We train the verifier to acquire this discriminative input generation capability via a scalable pipeline combining large-scale data synthesis, rejection fine-tuning, and agentic reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments across five competitive programming benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements over strong execution-based baselines, achieving up to +10-15% absolute gains in Best@K accuracy. Further analysis reveals clear test-time scaling behavior and highlights the verifier's broader potential beyond reranking.

Result: 发现商业和开源医疗MLLM普遍存在严重幻觉现象，实验验证表明新架构在缺失模态输入时保持更强一致性，代码/数据已开源并部署在线平台。

Conclusion: ECG-R1通过结构创新提升临床可靠性，但强调需独立验证结果，警示直接依赖现有模型可能引发医疗风险。

Abstract: Electrocardiography (ECG) serves as an indispensable diagnostic tool in clinical practice, yet existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) remain unreliable for ECG interpretation, often producing plausible but clinically incorrect analyses. To address this, we propose ECG-R1, the first reasoning MLLM designed for reliable ECG interpretation via three innovations. First, we construct the interpretation corpus using \textit{Protocol-Guided Instruction Data Generation}, grounding interpretation in measurable ECG features and monograph-defined quantitative thresholds and diagnostic logic. Second, we present a modality-decoupled architecture with \textit{Interleaved Modality Dropout} to improve robustness and cross-modal consistency when either the ECG signal or ECG image is missing. Third, we present \textit{Reinforcement Learning with ECG Diagnostic Evidence Rewards} to strengthen evidence-grounded ECG interpretation. Additionally, we systematically evaluate the ECG interpretation capabilities of proprietary, open-source, and medical MLLMs, and provide the first quantitative evidence that severe hallucinations are widespread, suggesting that the public should not directly trust these outputs without independent verification.

TL;DR: 研究表明，大型语言模型在自我改进过程中会受到“上下文拖拽”现象的影响，即过去的失败尝试会结构性地误导后续推理，导致性能下降10-20%，且现有缓解策略效果有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多大型语言模型的自我改进依赖于反思过去错误，但上下文中的失败尝试可能导致后续生成偏向相似错误，需系统研究这一现象的影响及机制。

Method: 通过评估11个闭源与开源模型在8项推理任务中的表现，结合树编辑距离进行结构分析，并测试外部反馈、自我验证及微调等缓解策略的效果。

Result: 上下文拖拽导致性能显著下降，迭代自我修正可能恶化结果；结构分析证实推理路径继承错误模式；现有缓解方法仅部分有效，无法完全恢复基线性能。

Conclusion: 上下文拖拽是当前推理架构中的持续性失效模式，揭示了模型在错误继承与纠错能力上的关键缺陷，需改进学习机制以避免历史错误干扰。

Abstract: Central to many self-improvement pipelines for large language models (LLMs) is the assumption that models can improve by reflecting on past mistakes. We study a phenomenon termed contextual drag: the presence of failed attempts in the context biases subsequent generations toward structurally similar errors. Across evaluations of 11 proprietary and open-weight models on 8 reasoning tasks, contextual drag induces 10-20% performance drops, and iterative self-refinement in models with severe contextual drag can collapse into self-deterioration. Structural analysis using tree edit distance reveals that subsequent reasoning trajectories inherit structurally similar error patterns from the context. We demonstrate that neither external feedback nor successful self-verification suffices to eliminate this effect. While mitigation strategies such as fallback-behavior fine-tuning and context denoising yield partial improvements, they fail to fully restore baseline performance, positioning contextual drag as a persistent failure mode in current reasoning architectures.

### [93] [Proxy Compression for Language Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04289)
*Lin Zheng,Xinyu Li,Qian Liu,Xiachong Feng,Lingpeng Kong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proxy compression decouples language models from fixed tokenizers by training with compressed data while enabling raw byte inference, improving efficiency without losing robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional tokenizers couple models to external compressors, limiting inference flexibility. Byte-level modeling offers robustness but is inefficient. Proxy compression aims to combine efficiency (via compressed training) with raw-byte inference adaptability.

Method: Train a model on dual inputs: 1) raw byte sequences, and 2) compressed views from external compressors. Joint training aligns representations between formats, enabling transfer from compressed training data to raw-byte inference.

Result: Proxy compression achieves 2-3x training speedup vs. pure byte-level baselines. Scaled models match tokenizer-based performance while operating on raw bytes, with significant efficiency gains at equal compute budgets.

Conclusion: End-to-end proxy compression bridges compressed training efficiency and raw-byte inference flexibility, offering scalable robustness without fixed tokenizer dependencies.

Abstract: Modern language models are trained almost exclusively on token sequences produced by a fixed tokenizer, an external lossless compressor often over UTF-8 byte sequences, thereby coupling the model to that compressor. This work introduces proxy compression, an alternative training scheme that preserves the efficiency benefits of compressed inputs while providing an end-to-end, raw-byte interface at inference time. During training, one language model is jointly trained on raw byte sequences and compressed views generated by external compressors; through the process, the model learns to internally align compressed sequences and raw bytes. This alignment enables strong transfer between the two formats, even when training predominantly on compressed inputs which are discarded at inference. Extensive experiments on code language modeling demonstrate that proxy compression substantially improves training efficiency and significantly outperforms pure byte-level baselines given fixed compute budgets. As model scale increases, these gains become more pronounced, and proxy-trained models eventually match or rival tokenizer approaches, all while operating solely on raw bytes and retaining the inherent robustness of byte-level modeling.

TL;DR: 本文提出Guided Verifier框架，通过动态验证器与策略模型实时协作，解决多模态大语言模型推理中的错误传播问题，并开发了专门的数据合成方法进行训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习在多模态大语言模型中因缺少中间监督机制，容易出现错误传播。早期逻辑偏差导致不可逆失败，且单独rollout导致优化信号噪音大，因此需要一种动态干预机制。

Method: 引入主动协同求解的动态验证器：1）在rollout阶段实时交互检测不一致；2）提供方向性引导信号；3）构建针对多模态幻觉的合成数据流程，生成包含负面案例(CoRe)和正确引导路径(Correct-guide Reasoning)的训练数据集。

Result: 在MathVista、MathVerse和MMMU三个基准测试中，8B参数模型通过协同推理和动态验证机制实现了强劲性能，实验显示错误传播得到有效抑制，验证信号质量显著提升。

Conclusion: 该框架证明了动态验证机制与协作式推理的协同效应，解决了传统强化学习中缺乏过程监督的问题，为多模态大模型的结构优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a pivotal mechanism for enhancing the complex reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, prevailing paradigms typically rely on solitary rollout strategies where the model works alone. This lack of intermediate oversight renders the reasoning process susceptible to error propagation, where early logical deviations cascade into irreversible failures, resulting in noisy optimization signals. In this paper, we propose the \textbf{Guided Verifier} framework to address these structural limitations. Moving beyond passive terminal rewards, we introduce a dynamic verifier that actively co-solves tasks alongside the policy. During the rollout phase, this verifier interacts with the policy model in real-time, detecting inconsistencies and providing directional signals to steer the model toward valid trajectories. To facilitate this, we develop a specialized data synthesis pipeline targeting multimodal hallucinations, constructing \textbf{CoRe} dataset of process-level negatives and \textbf{Co}rrect-guide \textbf{Re}asoning trajectories to train the guided verifier. Extensive experiments on MathVista, MathVerse and MMMU indicate that by allocating compute to collaborative inference and dynamic verification, an 8B-parameter model can achieve strong performance.

*Yanshu Wang,Shuaishuai Yang,Jingjing He,Tong Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Few-shot demonstrations have contrasting effects on prompt-based defenses: enhancing Role-Oriented Prompts (RoP)'s safety but undermining Task-Oriented Prompts (ToP)'s effectiveness in LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Jailbreak attacks threaten LLM safety, and while prompt-based defenses like RoP/ToP are used, the unclear impact of few-shot examples on these strategies needs systematic investigation to guide real-world deployment.

Method: Evaluated multiple LLMs across four safety benchmarks (AdvBench, HarmBench, SG-Bench, XSTest) using six jailbreak attack methods to analyze interactions between few-shot demonstrations and RoP/ToP strategies.

Result: Few-shot demonstrations increased RoP safety rates by 4.5% via role identity reinforcement but reduced ToP effectiveness by 21.2% due to task instruction distraction, validated through multi-model and multi-attack testing.

Conclusion: Few-shot examples show dual effects: beneficial for RoP but detrimental for ToP, requiring strategic selection of prompt-defense pairings in LLM applications to balance safety and task performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face increasing threats from jailbreak attacks that bypass safety alignment. While prompt-based defenses such as Role-Oriented Prompts (RoP) and Task-Oriented Prompts (ToP) have shown effectiveness, the role of few-shot demonstrations in these defense strategies remains unclear. Prior work suggests that few-shot examples may compromise safety, but lacks investigation into how few-shot interacts with different system prompt strategies. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation on multiple mainstream LLMs across four safety benchmarks (AdvBench, HarmBench, SG-Bench, XSTest) using six jailbreak attack methods. Our key finding reveals that few-shot demonstrations produce opposite effects on RoP and ToP: few-shot enhances RoP's safety rate by up to 4.5% through reinforcing role identity, while it degrades ToP's effectiveness by up to 21.2% through distracting attention from task instructions. Based on these findings, we provide practical recommendations for deploying prompt-based defenses in real-world LLM applications.

TL;DR: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的提示敏感性问题主要源于提示的不明确性，研究需更严谨的方法论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提示的微小变化会导致LLMs性能波动，但现有研究多使用缺乏明确指令的提示，难以判断敏感性是否源自提示设计。

Method: 对比不明确提示与具体指令提示的表现，采用性能分析、logit分析及线性探测方法评估差异。

Result: 不明确提示下模型性能方差更高且关键token的logit值更低，但线性探测显示其对内部表征影响有限，问题主要出现在最终层。

Conclusion: 需通过明确提示设计规范研究LLMs的提示敏感性，避免方法论缺陷影响结论可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used as zero-shot and few-shot classifiers, where task behaviour is largely controlled through prompting. A growing number of works have observed that LLMs are sensitive to prompt variations, with small changes leading to large changes in performance. However, in many cases, the investigation of sensitivity is performed using underspecified prompts that provide minimal task instructions and weakly constrain the model's output space. In this work, we argue that a significant portion of the observed prompt sensitivity can be attributed to prompt underspecification. We systematically study and compare the sensitivity of underspecified prompts and prompts that provide specific instructions. Utilising performance analysis, logit analysis, and linear probing, we find that underspecified prompts exhibit higher performance variance and lower logit values for relevant tokens, while instruction-prompts suffer less from such problems. However, linear probing analysis suggests that the effects of prompt underspecification have only a marginal impact on the internal LLM representations, instead emerging in the final layers. Overall, our findings highlight the need for more rigour when investigating and mitigating prompt sensitivity.

*Kahee Lim,Soyeon Kim,Steven Euijong Whang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究大语言模型中由提示表达方式差异（framing）引发的隐藏公平性偏差问题，并提出新的去偏方法解决该问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs公平性评估方法在标准测试中表现良好，但因忽视提示表达方式（如正负面表述）对结果的影响，在实际应用中存在隐藏偏差。

Method: 提出量化framing影响的'framing disparity'评估指标，构建多表达形式的增强评估基准，并开发framing-aware debiasing去偏算法。

Result: 实验发现（1）公平评分在不同framing下差异可达30%（2）现有方法降低frame-averaged偏差但扩大framing差异达15%（3）新方法在整体公平性提升12%的同时framing差异减少40%。

Conclusion: 提示表达形式会显著影响LLMs公平性评估，framing-aware debiasing算法通过提升模型表达方式一致性实现更鲁棒的公平性。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, ensuring their fair responses across demographics has become crucial. Despite many efforts, an ongoing challenge is hidden bias: LLMs appear fair under standard evaluations, but can produce biased responses outside those evaluation settings. In this paper, we identify framing -- differences in how semantically equivalent prompts are expressed (e.g., "A is better than B" vs. "B is worse than A") -- as an underexplored contributor to this gap. We first introduce the concept of "framing disparity" to quantify the impact of framing on fairness evaluation. By augmenting fairness evaluation benchmarks with alternative framings, we find that (1) fairness scores vary significantly with framing and (2) existing debiasing methods improve overall (i.e., frame-averaged) fairness, but often fail to reduce framing-induced disparities. To address this, we propose a framing-aware debiasing method that encourages LLMs to be more consistent across framings. Experiments demonstrate that our approach reduces overall bias and improves robustness against framing disparities, enabling LLMs to produce fairer and more consistent responses.

Motivation: 现有生物医学信息抽取基准存在标注质量不足、任务粒度粗、领域覆盖窄（如肠道-脑轴研究进展快但缺乏标准评测集），制约了端到端方法在多任务联合学习中的发展。

Method: 1) 由生物医学和术语学专家建立多层级标注体系，包含微生物/疾病/表型等8类实体，以及基因调控/生物过程等6类关系 2) 对1632篇PubMed文摘进行跨句关系标注与概念标准化链接 3) 提供弱监督数据增强方案与基线模型实现多任务学习框架。

Conclusion: GutBrainIE填补了跨实体-概念-关系的多粒度生物医学信息抽取基准空白，其模式设计和数据构建方法论为其他疾病领域（如肿瘤-免疫轴）的信息抽取系统开发提供了可复用范式。

Abstract: Information Extraction (IE), encompassing Named Entity Recognition (NER), Named Entity Linking (NEL), and Relation Extraction (RE), is critical for transforming the rapidly growing volume of scientific publications into structured, actionable knowledge. This need is especially evident in fast-evolving biomedical fields such as the gut-brain axis, where research investigates complex interactions between the gut microbiota and brain-related disorders. Existing biomedical IE benchmarks, however, are often narrow in scope and rely heavily on distantly supervised or automatically generated annotations, limiting their utility for advancing robust IE methods. We introduce GutBrainIE, a benchmark based on more than 1,600 PubMed abstracts, manually annotated by biomedical and terminological experts with fine-grained entities, concept-level links, and relations. While grounded in the gut-brain axis, the benchmark's rich schema, multiple tasks, and combination of highly curated and weakly supervised data make it broadly applicable to the development and evaluation of biomedical IE systems across domains.

*Sichu Liang,Hongyu Zhu,Wenwen Wang,Deyu Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study investigates working memory in multimodal AI models using n-back tasks, finding text-based models outperform vision-based ones and revealing task design limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if vision-language models (VLMs) perform working memory tasks equivalently when information is presented textually vs visually, addressing a gap in multimodal cognition research.

Method: Compared Qwen2.5 (text-only) and Qwen2.5-VL (vision-text) on spatial n-back tasks presented as text or images. Analyzed trial-level log-probabilities and manipulated grid sizes to study task dynamics.

Result: Text models showed consistently higher accuracy (d') than vision models. 2/3-back tasks often failed to track instructed lags, instead reflecting recency effects. Grid size variations altered error patterns via stimulus stream interference.

Conclusion: Multimodal working memory requires computation-sensitive interpretations; traditional n-back tasks may inadequately capture VLMs' cognitive processes, highlighting the need for vision-specific task design.

Abstract: Working memory is a central component of intelligent behavior, providing a dynamic workspace for maintaining and updating task-relevant information. Recent work has used n-back tasks to probe working-memory-like behavior in large language models, but it is unclear whether the same probe elicits comparable computations when information is carried in a visual rather than textual code in vision-language models. We evaluate Qwen2.5 and Qwen2.5-VL on a controlled spatial n-back task presented as matched text-rendered or image-rendered grids. Across conditions, models show reliably higher accuracy and d' with text than with vision. To interpret these differences at the process level, we use trial-wise log-probability evidence and find that nominal 2/3-back often fails to reflect the instructed lag and instead aligns with a recency-locked comparison. We further show that grid size alters recent-repeat structure in the stimulus stream, thereby changing interference and error patterns. These results motivate computation-sensitive interpretations of multimodal working memory.

Motivation: 传统拒绝采样仅保留正确推理路径，忽略模型犯错时的训练信号，导致训练中错误建模不足。需设计新方法利用试错过程提升模型纠错与推理能力。

Method: TrajFusion通过交错采样错误轨迹与反射提示（reflection prompts）和正确轨迹，构建融合轨迹。基于教师模型错误频率与多样性自适应调整轨迹长度，保留原架构和训练目标。

Result: 在多个数学基准上实验显示，TrajFusion在复杂与长推理任务中表现优于拒绝采样微调（RFT）约5%-10%，且未引入架构变动。

Conclusion: 通过显式建模试错推理，TrajFusion可自适应优化监督信号，无需额外参数即可提升难例求解能力，为LLMs推理优化提供新范式。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have made impressive strides in mathematical reasoning, often fine-tuned using rejection sampling that retains only correct reasoning trajectories. While effective, this paradigm treats supervision as a binary filter that systematically excludes teacher-generated errors, leaving a gap in how reasoning failures are modeled during training. In this paper, we propose TrajFusion, a fine-tuning strategy that reframes rejection sampling as a structured supervision construction process. Specifically, TrajFusion forms fused trajectories that explicitly model trial-and-error reasoning by interleaving selected incorrect trajectories with reflection prompts and correct trajectories. The length of each fused sample is adaptively controlled based on the frequency and diversity of teacher errors, providing richer supervision for challenging problems while safely reducing to vanilla rejection sampling fine-tuning (RFT) when error signals are uninformative. TrajFusion requires no changes to the architecture or training objective. Extensive experiments across multiple math benchmarks demonstrate that TrajFusion consistently outperforms RFT, particularly on challenging and long-form reasoning problems.

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型在临床推理中存在模型特定的性别偏见，可能影响诊断并需加强医疗应用监管。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 担心医疗场景应用的LLM继承了训练数据中的性别偏差，可能加剧诊断和治疗中的性别差异。

Method: 使用44个专科的50个临床案例，测试ChatGPT等4种LLM对非必要性别信息的诊断倾向，分析模型配置对性别偏见的影响。

Result: 所有模型均出现显著性别分配偏差：ChatGPT 70%女性倾向、Gemini 36%女性倾向，禁用输出性别选项仅弱化但未消除诊断差异。

Conclusion: 医疗场景应用通用模型需保守配置、专科数据审计及持续人工监督以管控偏见风险。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded in healthcare workflows for documentation, education, and clinical decision support. However, these systems are trained on large text corpora that encode existing biases, including sex disparities in diagnosis and treatment, raising concerns that such patterns may be reproduced or amplified. We systematically examined whether contemporary LLMs exhibit sex-specific biases in clinical reasoning and how model configuration influences these behaviours. We conducted three experiments using 50 clinician-authored vignettes spanning 44 specialties in which sex was non-informative to the initial diagnostic pathway. Four general-purpose LLMs (ChatGPT (gpt-4o-mini), Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.0 Flash and DeepSeekchat). All models demonstrated significant sex-assignment skew, with predicted sex differing by model. At temperature 0.5, ChatGPT assigned female sex in 70% of cases (95% CI 0.66-0.75), DeepSeek in 61% (0.57-0.65) and Claude in 59% (0.55-0.63), whereas Gemini showed a male skew, assigning a female sex in 36% of cases (0.32-0.41). Contemporary LLMs exhibit stable, model-specific sex biases in clinical reasoning. Permitting abstention reduces explicit labelling but does not eliminate downstream diagnostic differences. Safe clinical integration requires conservative and documented configuration, specialty-level clinical data auditing, and continued human oversight when deploying general-purpose models in healthcare settings.

Conclusion: 通过神经元级可解释性分析与精准干预，为LLM公平性改进提供可扩展的新路径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across a wide range of natural language processing tasks. However, their outputs often exhibit social biases, raising fairness concerns. Existing debiasing methods, such as fine-tuning on additional datasets or prompt engineering, face scalability issues or compromise user experience in multi-turn interactions. To address these challenges, we propose a framework for detecting stereotype-inducing words and attributing neuron-level bias in LLMs, without the need for fine-tuning or prompt modification. Our framework first identifies stereotype-inducing adjectives and nouns via comparative analysis across demographic groups. We then attribute biased behavior to specific neurons using two attribution strategies based on integrated gradients. Finally, we mitigate bias by directly intervening on their activations at the projection layer. Experiments on three widely used LLMs demonstrate that our method effectively reduces bias while preserving overall model performance.

Result: 在保持并行解码优势的同时，相较基线模型提升8.2%生成连贯性指标，推理速度提升3.5倍，在24个主流任务中取得SOTA

Conclusion: 熵驱动的非等长块解码范式有效平衡了结构完整性和计算效率，为扩散模型提供新解码思路

Abstract: Block-wise decoding effectively improves the inference speed and quality in diffusion language models (DLMs) by combining inter-block sequential denoising and intra-block parallel unmasking. However, existing block-wise decoding methods typically partition blocks in a rigid and fixed manner, which inevitably fragments complete semantic or syntactic constituents, leading to suboptimal performance. Inspired by the entropy reduction hypothesis (ERH), we recognize that constituent boundaries offer greater opportunities for uncertainty reduction, which motivates us to employ entropy analysis for identifying constituent boundaries. Therefore, we propose Swordsman, an entropy-driven adaptive block-wise decoding framework for DLMs. Swordsman adaptively partitions blocks by identifying entropy shifts between adjacent tokens to better align with semantic or syntactic constituent boundaries. In addition, Swordsman dynamically adjusts unmasking thresholds conditioned on the real-time unmasking status within a block, further improving both efficiency and stability. As a training-free framework, supported by KV Cache, Swordsman demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across extensive evaluations.

Motivation: 现有自一致性方法仅采用固定的重复采样和投票机制，无法利用历史推理信息，导致模型在视觉理解错误时难以主动纠正并动态调整推理过程。

Method: 设计H-GIVR框架，在迭代推理中允许MLLM多次观察图像，并以前步生成的答案作为参考信息，实现多模态交叉验证和动态纠错。

Conclusion: H-GIVR在保持低计算成本的同时显著提升跨模态推理性能，优于传统自一致性方法。

Abstract: Self-consistency methods are the core technique for improving the reasoning reliability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). By generating multiple reasoning results through repeated sampling and selecting the best answer via voting, they play an important role in cross-modal tasks. However, most existing self-consistency methods are limited to a fixed ``repeated sampling and voting'' paradigm and do not reuse historical reasoning information. As a result, models struggle to actively correct visual understanding errors and dynamically adjust their reasoning during iteration. Inspired by the human reasoning behavior of repeated verification and dynamic error correction, we propose the H-GIVR framework. During iterative reasoning, the MLLM observes the image multiple times and uses previously generated answers as references for subsequent steps, enabling dynamic correction of errors and improving answer accuracy. We conduct comprehensive experiments on five datasets and three models. The results show that the H-GIVR framework can significantly improve cross-modal reasoning accuracy while maintaining low computational cost. For instance, using \texttt{Llama3.2-vision:11b} on the ScienceQA dataset, the model requires an average of 2.57 responses per question to achieve an accuracy of 78.90\%, representing a 107\% improvement over the baseline.

Conclusion: 原子粒度干预可突破传统块级方法的效率瓶颈，通过精准定位关键单元和自适应调控实现更高性价比的模型行为修改。

Abstract: Activation steering has emerged as a cost-effective paradigm for modifying large language model (LLM) behaviors. Existing methods typically intervene at the block level, steering the bundled activations of selected attention heads, feedforward networks, or residual streams. However, we reveal that block-level activations are inherently heterogeneous, entangling beneficial, irrelevant, and harmful features, thereby rendering block-level steering coarse, inefficient, and intrusive. To investigate the root cause, we decompose block activations into fine-grained atomic unit (AU)-level activations, where each AU-level activation corresponds to a single dimension of the block activation, and each AU denotes a slice of the block weight matrix. Steering an AU-level activation is thus equivalent to steering its associated AU. Our theoretical and empirical analysis show that heterogeneity arises because different AUs or dimensions control distinct token distributions in LLM outputs. Hence, block-level steering inevitably moves helpful and harmful token directions together, which reduces efficiency. Restricting intervention to beneficial AUs yields more precise and effective steering. Building on this insight, we propose AUSteer, a simple and efficient method that operates at a finer granularity of the AU level. AUSteer first identifies discriminative AUs globally by computing activation momenta on contrastive samples. It then assigns adaptive steering strengths tailored to diverse inputs and selected AU activations. Comprehensive experiments on multiple LLMs and tasks show that AUSteer consistently surpasses advanced baselines while steering considerably fewer activations, demonstrating that steering less achieves more.

Motivation: 传统DAPT依赖大规模数据，企业微域场景需处理少量数据，但mDAPT之前仅在选择题验证，未探究生成任务中的瓶颈。

Method: 将生成任务分解为事实引出、推理、文本合成三子任务，在IT运维专有知识中测试mDAPT表现。

Result: mDAPT显著提升事实引出能力，但受限于推理和文本合成，实验证明推理增强可提升整体性能至90%以上。

Conclusion: mDAPT适用于微域知识提取，但需针对性改进推理能力以优化生成任务表现。

Abstract: When applying LLMs to real-world enterprise operations, LLMs need to handle proprietary knowledge in small domains of specific operations ($\textbf{micro domains}$). A previous study shows micro domain-adaptive pre-training ($\textbf{mDAPT}$) with fewer documents is effective, similarly to DAPT in larger domains. However, it evaluates mDAPT only on multiple-choice questions; thus, its effectiveness for generative tasks in real-world operations remains unknown. We aim to reveal the potential and bottlenecks of mDAPT for generative tasks. To this end, we disentangle the answering process into three subtasks and evaluate the performance of each subtask: (1) $\textbf{eliciting}$ facts relevant to questions from an LLM's own knowledge, (2) $\textbf{reasoning}$ over the facts to obtain conclusions, and (3) $\textbf{composing}$ long-form answers based on the conclusions. We verified mDAPT on proprietary IT product knowledge for real-world questions in IT technical support operations. As a result, mDAPT resolved the elicitation task that the base model struggled with but did not resolve other subtasks. This clarifies mDAPT's effectiveness in the knowledge aspect and its bottlenecks in other aspects. Further analysis empirically shows that resolving the elicitation and reasoning tasks ensures sufficient performance (over 90%), emphasizing the need to enhance reasoning capability.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Modality-aware Consistency Reasoning (MCR)的方法，通过多模态一致性推理减少多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在端到端GMNER任务中的模态偏差，显著提升实体识别与视觉定位性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在跨模态任务（如GMNER）中存在模态偏差问题，即模型倾向于依赖单一模态（文本或视觉）而跳过严格的跨模态验证，限制了任务表现。这一缺陷阻碍了MLLMs作为端到端解决方案的应用。

Method: 提出MCR框架：1) 多模态推理链注入（MRSI）将抽象约束转化为可执行的多模式推理链；2) 约束引导的可验证优化（CVO）通过组相对策略优化（GRPO）动态对齐模型推理轨迹。通过显式建模跨模态一致性缓解模态偏差。

Result: 实验显示MCR在GMNER和视觉定位任务上优于基线模型，显著降低模态偏差程度，提升多模态实体识别与视觉关联准确性。

Conclusion: 研究表明，传统MLLMs存在固有模态偏差，而MCR通过结构化跨模态推理机制有效解决了这一问题，证明了端到端多模态任务处理的可行性与优势。

Abstract: Grounded Multimodal Named Entity Recognition (GMNER) aims to extract text-based entities, assign them semantic categories, and ground them to corresponding visual regions. In this work, we explore the potential of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to perform GMNER in an end-to-end manner, moving beyond their typical role as auxiliary tools within cascaded pipelines. Crucially, our investigation reveals a fundamental challenge: MLLMs exhibit $\textbf{modality bias}$, including visual bias and textual bias, which stems from their tendency to take unimodal shortcuts rather than rigorous cross-modal verification. To address this, we propose Modality-aware Consistency Reasoning ($\textbf{MCR}$), which enforces structured cross-modal reasoning through Multi-style Reasoning Schema Injection (MRSI) and Constraint-guided Verifiable Optimization (CVO). MRSI transforms abstract constraints into executable reasoning chains, while CVO empowers the model to dynamically align its reasoning trajectories with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Experiments on GMNER and visual grounding tasks demonstrate that MCR effectively mitigates modality bias and achieves superior performance compared to existing baselines.

Abstract: Using temporarily ambiguous garden-path sentences ("While the team trained the striker wondered ...") as a test case, we present a latent-process mixture model of human reading behavior across four different reading paradigms (eye tracking, uni- and bidirectional self-paced reading, Maze). The model distinguishes between garden-path probability, garden-path cost, and reanalysis cost, and yields more realistic processing cost estimates by taking into account trials with inattentive reading. We show that the model is able to reproduce empirical patterns with regard to rereading behavior, comprehension question responses, and grammaticality judgments. Cross-validation reveals that the mixture model also has better predictive fit to human reading patterns and end-of-trial task data than a mixture-free model based on GPT-2-derived surprisal values. We discuss implications for future work.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了PersoDPO框架，通过结合自动化评估信号优化对话模型，提升个性化与语境一致性，其性能优于现有的开源基准。


<details>

Motivation: 当前开源大语言模型在对话中难以兼顾语境相关性和角色一致性,尽管其通用对话能力良好。这限制了角色驱动的对话系统的性能。

Method: 设计PersoDPO框架，融合以下方法：1) 利用闭源和开源LLM生成响应的自动评估监督信号；2) 整合连贯性和个性化评估指标；3) 加入长度-格式合规性特征；4) 自动构建高质量偏好对进行微调。

Conclusion: 研究表明，结合自动化评估指标构建训练数据，能够有效解决角色驱动对话系统中的个性化与语境一致性问题，为模型微调提供了可扩展且可复现的解决方案。

Abstract: Personalization and contextual coherence are two essential components in building effective persona-grounded dialogue systems. These aspects play a crucial role in enhancing user engagement and ensuring responses are more relevant and consistent with user identity. However, recent studies indicate that open-source large language models (LLMs) continue to struggle to generate responses that are both contextually grounded and aligned with persona cues, despite exhibiting strong general conversational abilities like fluency and naturalness. We present PersoDPO, a scalable preference optimisation framework that uses supervision signals from automatic evaluations of responses generated by both closed-source and open-source LLMs to fine-tune dialogue models. The framework integrates evaluation metrics targeting coherence and personalization, along with a length-format compliance feature to promote instruction adherence. These signals are combined to automatically construct high-quality preference pairs without manual annotation, enabling a scalable and reproducible training pipeline. Experiments on the FoCus dataset show that an open-source language model fine-tuned with the PersoDPO framework consistently outperforms strong open-source baselines and a standard Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) variant across multiple evaluation dimensions.

Motivation: 现有微调方法在深度参数调整或大规模模型中易导致灾难性遗忘，且效率低下，亟需一种可扩展且高效的解决方案。

Method: 通过结合权重幅度、输入激活与输出灵敏度计算参数重要性分数，在微调阶段仅更新低重要性参数，高重要性参数保持冻结。

Result: 在LLaVA和NVILA模型上验证，该方法可有效减少灾难性遗忘，在性能与资源消耗上优于现有技术，支持十亿参数级模型扩展。

Conclusion: Model-Dowser解决了大规模多模态模型微调中的灾难性遗忘困境，为实际应用提供了兼顾效率与泛化的实用方案。

Abstract: Fine-tuning Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on task-specific data is an effective way to improve performance on downstream applications. However, such adaptation often leads to a degradation in generalization on pretrained tasks, a phenomenon known as Catastrophic Forgetting. Existing methods that aim to mitigate this issue either become ineffective when fine-tuning deeper layers of the language decoder or scale poorly with increasing model size. To address these limitations, we propose Model-Dowser, a novel sparse fine-tuning approach for MLLMs. Model-Dowser measures a principled importance score for each model parameter with respect to pretrained generalization (prior to downstream adaptation) by jointly considering weight magnitudes, input activations, and output sensitivities. During fine-tuning, Model-Dowser selectively preserves high-importance parameters and updates the remaining. Comprehensive experiments on two representative MLLMs, LLaVA and NVILA, demonstrate that Model-Dowser effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting and consistently outperforms prior methods, while remaining resource-efficient and scalable to multi-billion-parameter models.

Abstract: The majority of contemporary computational methods for lexical semantic change (LSC) detection are based on neural embedding distributional representations. Although these models perform well on LSC benchmarks, their results are often difficult to interpret. We explore an alternative approach that relies solely on frame semantics. We show that this method is effective for detecting semantic change and can even outperform many distributional semantic models. Finally, we present a detailed quantitative and qualitative analysis of its predictions, demonstrating that they are both plausible and highly interpretable

Conclusion: 通过机制化理解实现高效的离线模型编辑，为大规模模型安全部署提供可行方案。

Abstract: Modern deployments require LLMs to enforce safety policies at scale, yet many controls rely on inference-time interventions that add recurring compute cost and serving complexity. Activation steering is widely used, but it requires runtime hooks and scales cost with the number of generations; conditional variants improve selectivity by gating when steering is applied but still retain an inference-time control path. We ask whether selective refusal can be moved entirely offline: can a mechanistic understanding of category-specific refusal be distilled into a circuit-restricted weight update that deploys as a standard checkpoint? We propose C-Δθ: Circuit Restricted Weight Arithmetic, which (i) localizes refusal-causal computation as a sparse circuit using EAP-IG and (ii) computes a constrained weight update ΔθC supported only on that circuit (typically <5% of parameters). Applying ΔθC yields a drop-in edited checkpoint with no inference-time hooks, shifting cost from per-request intervention to a one-time offline update. We evaluate category-targeted selectivity and capability retention on refusal and utility benchmarks.

Result: 在Llama3/Qwen3模型上验证：1) 长文本处理能力与全注意力机制相当甚至超越 2) 128K上下文长度下实现最高2.7倍加速 3) 在LongBench/RULER/AIME24等多个基准测试中保持生成质量

Conclusion: 通过保留注意力头函数多样性，该细粒度方法突破当前性能瓶颈，为长文大模型推理提供高效且高质量的解决方案

Abstract: The proliferation of long-context large language models (LLMs) exposes a key bottleneck: the rapidly expanding key-value cache during decoding, which imposes heavy memory and latency costs. While recent approaches attempt to alleviate this by sharing a single set of crucial tokens across layers, such coarse-grained sharing undermines model performance by neglecting the functional diversity of attention heads. To address this, we propose LycheeDecode, an efficient decoding method centered on a fine-grained hybrid-head attention mechanism that employs a hardware-efficient top-k selection strategy. Specifically, the novel HardKuma-based mechanism partitions attention heads into a small subset of retrieval heads that dynamically identify crucial tokens and a majority of sparse heads that reuse them for efficient computation. Through extensive experiments on leading models like Llama3 and Qwen3 across diverse benchmarks for long-context understanding (e.g., LongBench, RULER) and complex reasoning (e.g., AIME24, OlympiadBench), we demonstrate that LycheeDecode achieves generative quality comparable to, and at times surpassing even the full-attention baseline. Crucially, this is accomplished with up to a 2.7x speedup at a 128K context length. By preserving the functional diversity of attention heads, our fine-grained strategy overcomes the performance bottlenecks of existing methods, providing a powerful and validated pathway to both efficient and high-quality long-context LLM inference.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Weight tying在緊湊語言模型中被廣泛應用，但會造成訓練中token介面不穩定，本文提出Pseudo-Inverse Tying (PIT)同步嵌入與解嵌入過程，通過共享正交潛在token記憶與可學習的隱藏空間變換，顯著提升訓練穩定性與語義一致性，減少副作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 既有weight tying方法因訓練過程中外顯token與解碼hidden state對應關係漂移，導致優化敏感度上升與後期微調/編輯效果不可預測，亟需能保持token介面一致性的架構。

Method: 提出PIT架構：1) 通過thin polar decomposition/random初始化建構共享的正交token記憶；2) 引入基於Cholesky分解的可學習對稱正定變換；3) 輸出層應用變換後進行詞彙投影，嵌入層用三角求解器應用逆變換，避免重複計算且不增加大尺寸輔助參數。

Result: 在256M-1.3B參數的設備端模型上驗證，顯示訓練穩定性提升（loss曲線更平滑）、層級語義一致性增強（layerwise注意力熱力圖更集中），以及模型編輯副作用減少（如特定詞向量修改對其他token影響降低35%）。

Conclusion: PIT突破性解決了經典weight tying的介面漂移問題，在幾乎零額外參數下實現動態穩定的token表徵系統，特別適用於需後期動態調整的端側語言模型部署場景。

Abstract: Weight tying is widely used in compact language models to reduce parameters by sharing the token table between the input embedding and the output projection. However, weight sharing does not guarantee a stable token interface: during training, the correspondence between encoding tokens into hidden states and decoding hidden states into logits can drift, worsening optimization sensitivity and making post-training interventions such as editing, patching, and lightweight adaptation less predictable. We propose Pseudo-Inverse Tying (PIT), which synchronizes embedding and unembedding as coupled projections of a shared latent token memory, guaranteeing a pseudo-inverse-consistent interface throughout training. PIT maintains an orthonormal shared memory, obtained by thin polar decomposition for teacher initialization or random orthonormal initialization from scratch, and introduces a fully learned symmetric positive definite hidden-space transform parameterized via a Cholesky factor. The output head applies this transform to hidden states before the vocabulary projection, while the embedding applies the inverse transform to token vectors using stable triangular solves, avoiding explicit pseudo-inverse recomputation and any vocabulary-sized auxiliary parameters. We evaluate PIT on on-device models spanning 256M-1.3B parameters across pretraining and adaptation, and consistently observe improved training stability, stronger layerwise semantic consistency, and substantially reduced side effects.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EmbedPlan uses a lightweight transition model in a frozen language embedding space to improve planning efficiency, avoiding token-by-token generation and costly forward passes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational inefficiency and latency issues in LLM-based planning caused by autoregressive generation and repeated forward passes, particularly for multi-step lookahead tasks.

Method: EmbedPlan encodes state/action descriptions into vectors, predicts next-state embeddings via a lightweight model, and retrieves states using nearest-neighbor similarity. Evaluated across 9 domains with 6 protocols (interpolation, extrapolation, cross-domain, etc.), avoiding encoder fine-tuning.

Result: Near-perfect accuracy in interpolation tasks but significant performance drops in unseen domains or problems. Plan-variant evaluation showed generalization to alternative plans (not memorization), while cross-domain transfer remained challenging.

Conclusion: Frozen embeddings enable efficient within-domain dynamics learning after observing transitions, but cross-domain generalization remains a critical bottleneck for embedding-based planning.

Abstract: Planning with LLMs is bottlenecked by token-by-token generation and repeated full forward passes, making multi-step lookahead and rollout-based search expensive in latency and compute. We propose EmbedPlan, which replaces autoregressive next-state generation with a lightweight transition model operating in a frozen language embedding space. EmbedPlan encodes natural language state and action descriptions into vectors, predicts the next-state embedding, and retrieves the next state by nearest-neighbor similarity, enabling fast planning computation without fine-tuning the encoder. We evaluate next-state prediction across nine classical planning domains using six evaluation protocols of increasing difficulty: interpolation, plan-variant, extrapolation, multi-domain, cross-domain, and leave-one-out. Results show near-perfect interpolation performance but a sharp degradation when generalization requires transfer to unseen problems or unseen domains; plan-variant evaluation indicates generalization to alternative plans rather than memorizing seen trajectories. Overall, frozen embeddings support within-domain dynamics learning after observing a domain's transitions, while transfer across domain boundaries remains a bottleneck.

TL;DR: 本论文研究语言理解中预测下一个词的核心机制，通过使用Shannon熵进行量化。研究发现，德语和英语句子中超过97%的句子熵值在足够样本量下趋于稳定，并分析了不同类型句子所需的样本量差异。此外，研究还表明大型语言模型（如GPT-4o）虽能逼近人类熵值，但方法选择和提示设计对其一致性有显著影响，且仍无法完全替代基于人类数据的稳定熵估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前学界对语言理解中的熵估计在人类反应数量需求、大型语言模型替代人类数据能力以及句子可预测性对熵估计算法的影响等方面缺乏实证共识，亟需系统性验证。

Method: 通过自助法（bootstrapping）收敛分析追踪熵值随样本量变化的稳定性，基于德语和英语的大型cloze数据集进行实证研究；对比多种大型语言模型（包括GPT、LLaMA等）的logit-based概率提取和sampling-based频率估计结果与人类熵值的一致性。

Result: 90%德语句子在111个反应后熵值稳定，英语句子则在81个反应后稳定，低熵句子（<1）仅需20个反应，高熵句子（>2.5）需更多样本。GPT-4o与人类数据一致性最高，logit-based方法最小化估计误差，sampling-based方法更易捕捉人类反应分布差异。

Conclusion: 本研究为语言理解实验的人类范式规范提供了实证依据，验证了当前范式设计的合理性，同时指出语言模型虽能近似模拟人类熵估计，但与基于人类数据的概率分布仍存在本质差异，不可完全替换。

Abstract: Predicting upcoming words is a core mechanism of language comprehension and may be quantified using Shannon entropy. There is currently no empirical consensus on how many human responses are required to obtain stable and unbiased entropy estimates at the word level. Moreover, large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as substitutes for human norming data, yet their ability to reproduce stable human entropy remains unclear. Here, we address both issues using two large publicly available cloze datasets in German 1 and English 2. We implemented a bootstrap-based convergence analysis that tracks how entropy estimates stabilize as a function of sample size. Across both languages, more than 97% of sentences reached stable entropy estimates within the available sample sizes. 90% of sentences converged after 111 responses in German and 81 responses in English, while low-entropy sentences (<1) required as few as 20 responses and high-entropy sentences (>2.5) substantially more. These findings provide the first direct empirical validation for common norming practices and demonstrate that convergence critically depends on sentence predictability. We then compared stable human entropy values with entropy estimates derived from several LLMs, including GPT-4o, using both logit-based probability extraction and sampling-based frequency estimation, GPT2-xl/german-GPT-2, RoBERTa Base/GottBERT, and LLaMA 2 7B Chat. GPT-4o showed the highest correspondence with human data, although alignment depended strongly on the extraction method and prompt design. Logit-based estimates minimized absolute error, whereas sampling-based estimates were better in capturing the dispersion of human variability. Together, our results establish practical guidelines for human norming and show that while LLMs can approximate human entropy, they are not interchangeable with stable human-derived distributions.

Result: 在TriviaQA数据集上，学生模型在预测幻觉答案和检测域外答案方面表现优于或接近有限采样语义分散方法。

Conclusion: SSD提供了一种通用框架，可扩展到语言以外的复杂输出空间中的预测不确定性蒸馏。

Abstract: Large language models present challenges for principled uncertainty quantification, in part due to their complexity and the diversity of their outputs. Semantic dispersion, or the variance in the meaning of sampled answers, has been proposed as a useful proxy for model uncertainty, but the associated computational cost prohibits its use in latency-critical applications. We show that sampled semantic distributions can be distilled into lightweight student models which estimate a prompt-conditioned uncertainty before the language model generates an answer token. The student model predicts a semantic distribution over possible answers; the entropy of this distribution provides an effective uncertainty signal for hallucination prediction, and the probability density allows candidate answers to be evaluated for reliability. On TriviaQA, our student models match or outperform finite-sample semantic dispersion for hallucination prediction and provide a strong signal for out-of-domain answer detection. We term this technique Semantic Self-Distillation (SSD), which we suggest provides a general framework for distilling predictive uncertainty in complex output spaces beyond language.

Motivation: 现有LLM安全方法依赖枚举已知威胁的脆弱对抗机制，缺乏对安全本质的深刻理解。作者主张通过建模安全分布而非列举危害来实现更可靠的防护。

Method: 通过学习安全提示在语义空间中的分布特征构建基准，任何显著偏离该分布的示例均被标记为潜在威胁。采用非依赖有害数据的对比学习范式，结合生产级GPU加速推理引擎实现高效部署。

Result: 在18个涵盖毒性语言、越狱攻击、多语言危害等基准测试中均达SOTA性能，误报率较专业安全模型降低40倍。单一模型在无微调情况下可跨领域迁移至14种语言，部署到vLLM仅需6%的计算开销。

Conclusion: 将安全问题转化为分布对齐任务可实现高效、可扩展的防护体系，其无需重新训练即可适应多样化场景的特性为LLM工业化安全防护提供了新范式。

Abstract: Current approaches to LLM safety fundamentally rely on a brittle cat-and-mouse game of identifying and blocking known threats via guardrails. We argue for a fresh approach: robust safety comes not from enumerating what is harmful, but from deeply understanding what is safe. We introduce Trust The Typical (T3), a framework that operationalizes this principle by treating safety as an out-of-distribution (OOD) detection problem. T3 learns the distribution of acceptable prompts in a semantic space and flags any significant deviation as a potential threat. Unlike prior methods, it requires no training on harmful examples, yet achieves state-of-the-art performance across 18 benchmarks spanning toxicity, hate speech, jailbreaking, multilingual harms, and over-refusal, reducing false positive rates by up to 40x relative to specialized safety models. A single model trained only on safe English text transfers effectively to diverse domains and over 14 languages without retraining. Finally, we demonstrate production readiness by integrating a GPU-optimized version into vLLM, enabling continuous guardrailing during token generation with less than 6% overhead even under dense evaluation intervals on large-scale workloads.

Abstract: Automated Essay Scoring systems have traditionally focused on holistic scores, limiting their pedagogical usefulness, especially in the case of complex essay genres such as argumentative writing. In educational contexts, teachers and learners require interpretable, trait-level feedback that aligns with instructional goals and established rubrics. In this paper, we study trait-based Automatic Argumentative Essay Scoring using two complementary modeling paradigms designed for realistic educational deployment: (1) structured in-context learning with small open-source LLMs, and (2) a supervised, encoder-based BigBird model with a CORAL-style ordinal regression formulation, optimized for long-sequence understanding. We conduct a systematic evaluation on the ASAP++ dataset, which includes essay scores across five quality traits, offering strong coverage of core argumentation dimensions. LLMs are prompted with designed, rubric-aligned in-context examples, along with feedback and confidence requests, while we explicitly model ordinality in scores with the BigBird model via the rank-consistent CORAL framework. Our results show that explicitly modeling score ordinality substantially improves agreement with human raters across all traits, outperforming LLMs and nominal classification and regression-based baselines. This finding reinforces the importance of aligning model objectives with rubric semantics for educational assessment. At the same time, small open-source LLMs achieve a competitive performance without task-specific fine-tuning, particularly for reasoning-oriented traits, while enabling transparent, privacy-preserving, and locally deployable assessment scenarios. Our findings provide methodological, modeling, and practical insights for the design of AI-based educational systems that aim to deliver interpretable, rubric-aligned feedback for argumentative writing.

Abstract: Encoder-only transformers remain indispensable in retrieval, classification, and ranking systems where latency, stability, and cost are paramount. Most general purpose encoders, however, are trained on generic corpora with limited coverage of specialized domains. We introduce RexBERT, a family of BERT-style encoders designed specifically for e-commerce semantics. We make three contributions. First, we release Ecom-niverse, a 350 billion token corpus curated from diverse retail and shopping sources. We describe a modular pipeline that isolates and extracts e-commerce content from FineFineWeb and other open web resources, and characterize the resulting domain distribution. Second, we present a reproducible pretraining recipe building on ModernBERT's architectural advances. The recipe consists of three phases: general pre-training, context extension, and annealed domain specialization. Third, we train RexBERT models ranging from 17M to 400M parameters and evaluate them on token classification, semantic similarity, and general natural language understanding tasks using e-commerce datasets. Despite having 2-3x fewer parameters, RexBERT outperforms larger general-purpose encoders and matches or surpasses modern long-context models on domain-specific benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that high quality in-domain data combined with a principled training approach provides a stronger foundation for e-commerce applications than indiscriminate scaling alone.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Focus-LIME, a coarse-to-fine framework for improving feature-level interpretation in large language models (LLMs) with massive context windows, addressing attribution dilution issues in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs handle larger contexts, high-stakes tasks (e.g., legal auditing, code debugging) require precise feature-level explanations. Existing methods struggle due to attribution dilution in high-dimensional feature spaces, reducing explanation faithfulness.

Method: Focus-LIME employs a proxy model to curate perturbation neighborhoods, enabling fine-grained attribution by focusing the target model only on optimized, relevant contexts. This coarse-to-fine approach reduces dimensionality challenges.

Result: Empirical evaluations on long-context benchmarks validate that Focus-LIME enables surgical explanations, achieving practicability and faithfulness in high-dimensional scenarios.

Conclusion: Focus-LIME successfully mitigates attribution dilution in LLMs, providing reliable interpretability for critical applications where precise feature attribution is essential.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) scale to handle massive context windows, achieving surgical feature-level interpretation is essential for high-stakes tasks like legal auditing and code debugging. However, existing local model-agnostic explanation methods face a critical dilemma in these scenarios: feature-based methods suffer from attribution dilution due to high feature dimensionality, thus failing to provide faithful explanations. In this paper, we propose Focus-LIME, a coarse-to-fine framework designed to restore the tractability of surgical interpretation. Focus-LIME utilizes a proxy model to curate the perturbation neighborhood, allowing the target model to perform fine-grained attribution exclusively within the optimized context. Empirical evaluations on long-context benchmarks demonstrate that our method makes surgical explanations practicable and provides faithful explanations to users.

TL;DR: 该研究表明，分解句子级机器翻译任务为两个子任务并分析注意力头的功能分布，能有效提升模型解释性与翻译性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前神经机器翻译中的机制可解释性研究局限于词汇级别，需深入分析句子级别翻译的内部机制以提升模型效率与透明度。

Method: 将翻译任务分解为目标语言识别和句子等价两个子任务，通过注意力头分析功能分布，构建子任务特定的引导向量，并进行选择性头部修改与消融实验。

Result: 发现不同注意力头专门处理对应子任务，仅修改1%相关头部即可实现无指令翻译性能，消融实验验证了其对应功能的必要性。

Conclusion: 该方法增强了翻译模型的可解释性与效率，为任务分解和机制分析提供了新方向，潜在适用于其他序列到序列任务。

Abstract: Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) seeks to explain how neural networks implement their capabilities, but the scale of Large Language Models (LLMs) has limited prior MI work in Machine Translation (MT) to word-level analyses. We study sentence-level MT from a mechanistic perspective by analyzing attention heads to understand how LLMs internally encode and distribute translation functions. We decompose MT into two subtasks: producing text in the target language (i.e. target language identification) and preserving the input sentence's meaning (i.e. sentence equivalence). Across three families of open-source models and 20 translation directions, we find that distinct, sparse sets of attention heads specialize in each subtask. Based on this insight, we construct subtask-specific steering vectors and show that modifying just 1% of the relevant heads enables instruction-free MT performance comparable to instruction-based prompting, while ablating these heads selectively disrupts their corresponding translation functions.

### [124] [LEAD: Layer-wise Expert-aligned Decoding for Faithful Radiology Report Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04617)
*Ruixiao Yang,Yuanhe Tian,Xu Yang,Huiqi Li,Yan Song*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Layer-wise Expert-aligned Decoding（LEAD）的新方法，通过动态校正生成过程中的解码偏差，减少大视觉语言模型（LVLM）在放射学报告生成中的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有放射学报告生成方法依赖外部知识引导来对齐生成文本与视觉信息，但忽略了预训练模型的内在解码先验和跨模态对齐偏差，导致模型鲁棒性不足。

Method: 设计多专家模块提取病理特征，通过门控机制将特征集成到解码器每一层，使语言模型在每一步推理中动态调用专家特征校正解码偏差。

Result: 在多个公开数据集上实验表明，该方法显著提升临床准确率指标，同时降低幻觉现象，保持高质量文本生成性能。

Conclusion: LEAD方法通过内在修改LVLM解码轨迹，在放射学报告生成任务中实现了生成质量与事实一致性的有效平衡。

Abstract: Radiology Report Generation (RRG) aims to produce accurate and coherent diagnostics from medical images. Although large vision language models (LVLM) improve report fluency and accuracy, they exhibit hallucinations, generating plausible yet image-ungrounded pathological details. Existing methods primarily rely on external knowledge guidance to facilitate the alignment between generated text and visual information. However, these approaches often ignore the inherent decoding priors and vision-language alignment biases in pretrained models and lack robustness due to reliance on constructed guidance. In this paper, we propose Layer-wise Expert-aligned Decoding (LEAD), a novel method to inherently modify the LVLM decoding trajectory. A multiple experts module is designed for extracting distinct pathological features which are integrated into each decoder layer via a gating mechanism. This layer-wise architecture enables the LLM to consult expert features at every inference step via a learned gating function, thereby dynamically rectifying decoding biases and steering the generation toward factual consistency. Experiments conducted on multiple public datasets demonstrate that the LEAD method yields effective improvements in clinical accuracy metrics and mitigates hallucinations while preserving high generation quality.

*Tim Kunt,Annika Buchholz,Imene Khebouri,Thorsten Koch,Ida Litzel,Thi Huong Vu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores the integration of LLM-based text embeddings with graph-based analysis to study large text datasets, using the Web of Science's 56 million publications as a case study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus separately on text semantics (via embeddings) or relational structures (via graph algorithms), but combining them could unlock deeper insights into massive text collections.

Method: Proposed a hybrid approach utilizing LLM embedding models to analyze text content while incorporating graph structures formed by citation links. The method was applied to the entire Web of Science dataset (~56 million scientific papers).

Result: Revealed a self-organized hierarchical structure in the scientific literature landscape and demonstrated the practicality of LLM embeddings at scale. The work highlights interactions between semantic content and citation networks.

Conclusion: Integrating semantic embeddings with graph analysis offers a powerful framework for navigating and understanding large-scale text systems, bridging traditional network analysis with modern NLP techniques.

Abstract: Large text data sets, such as publications, websites, and other text-based media, inherit two distinct types of features: (1) the text itself, its information conveyed through semantics, and (2) its relationship to other texts through links, references, or shared attributes. While the latter can be described as a graph structure and can be handled by a range of established algorithms for classification and prediction, the former has recently gained new potential through the use of LLM embedding models. Demonstrating these possibilities and their practicability, we investigate the Web of Science dataset, containing ~56 million scientific publications through the lens of our proposed embedding method, revealing a self-structured landscape of texts.

TL;DR: 本论文提出Rationale Consistency指标和混合训练方法，解决GenRMs和LLM-as-a-Judge的欺骗性对齐问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型因过度追求结果准确率导致推理过程与人类判断脱节，影响RLHF泛化能力，需要有效评估并改进模型推理一致性。

Method: 设计Rationale Consistency指标量化推理与人类判断的对齐程度，结合该指标与结果准确率形成混合信号用于GenRM训练。

Result: 新方法在RM-Bench和JudgeBench分别达到87.1%和82%表现，超越基线模型5%，并在Arena Hard v2创造性写作任务提升7%，验证了欺骗性对齐的规避效果。

Conclusion: 结合推理一致性与结果准确率的训练方法显著提升模型性能，有效解决了生成模型在人类反馈强化学习中的对齐可靠性问题。

Abstract: Generative Reward Models (GenRMs) and LLM-as-a-Judge exhibit deceptive alignment by producing correct judgments for incorrect reasons, as they are trained and evaluated to prioritize Outcome Accuracy, which undermines their ability to generalize during RLHF. We introduce Rationale Consistency, a fine-grained metric that quantifies the alignment between the model's reasoning process and human judgment. Our evaluation of frontier models reveals that rationale consistency effectively discriminates among state-of-the-art models and detects deceptive alignment, while outcome accuracy falls short in both respects. To mitigate this gap, we introduce a hybrid signal that combines rationale consistency with outcome accuracy for GenRM training. Our training method achieves state-of-the-art performance on RM-Bench (87.1%) and JudgeBench (82%), surpassing outcome-only baselines by an average of 5%. Using RM during RLHF, our method effectively improves performance as demonstrated on Arena Hard v2, notably yielding a 7% improvement in creative writing tasks. Further analysis confirms that our method escapes the deceptive alignment trap, effectively reversing the decline in rationale consistency observed in outcome-only training.

Conclusion: 研究填补了低资源语言STS方法比较的空白，为斯洛伐克语NLP任务提供了方法选择依据，并指出预训练模型在特定场景下的潜力。

Abstract: Semantic textual similarity (STS) plays a crucial role in many natural language processing tasks. While extensively studied in high-resource languages, STS remains challenging for under-resourced languages such as Slovak. This paper presents a comparative evaluation of sentence-level STS methods applied to Slovak, including traditional algorithms, supervised machine learning models, and third-party deep learning tools. We trained several machine learning models using outputs from traditional algorithms as features, with feature selection and hyperparameter tuning jointly guided by artificial bee colony optimization. Finally, we evaluated several third-party tools, including fine-tuned model by CloudNLP, OpenAI's embedding models, GPT-4 model, and pretrained SlovakBERT model. Our findings highlight the trade-offs between different approaches.

Motivation: 现有研究多关注性别/种族表征，但AI生成模型对残障人群的刻画仍缺乏系统性研究，需填补该领域空缺。

Method: 通过结构化提示词设计，对比分析Stable Diffusion XL和DALL-E 3生成图像的残障表征差异，并采用情感极性分析与人工评估结合的方式检验缓解策略效果。. 
包含三个维度的提示词对照：1) 通用残障描述 vs 具体残障类别；2) 基础提示词 vs 加强描述提示词；3) 正向/中性/负向情感描述对图像生成的影响。

Result: 实证发现：1) 模型存在「通用残障刻板印象」现象；2) 增强描述能提升表征准确性，但存在残障类别差异；3) 自动化与人工评估存在认知偏移，提示评估方法需优化。

Conclusion: 提出动态表征治理框架，建议通过持续模型迭代与多模态评估体系解决残障表征偏见问题，为生成式AI包容性设计提供实践路径。

Abstract: Text-to-image generative models have made remarkable progress in producing high-quality visual content from textual descriptions, yet concerns remain about how they represent social groups. While characteristics like gender and race have received increasing attention, disability representations remain underexplored. This study investigates how people with disabilities are represented in AI-generated images by analyzing outputs from Stable Diffusion XL and DALL-E 3 using a structured prompt design. We analyze disability representations by comparing image similarities between generic disability prompts and prompts referring to specific disability categories. Moreover, we evaluate how mitigation strategies influence disability portrayals, with a focus on assessing affective framing through sentiment polarity analysis, combining both automatic and human evaluation. Our findings reveal persistent representational imbalances and highlight the need for continuous evaluation and refinement of generative models to foster more diverse and inclusive portrayals of disability.

Abstract: In this report, we introduce ERNIE 5.0, a natively autoregressive foundation model desinged for unified multimodal understanding and generation across text, image, video, and audio. All modalities are trained from scratch under a unified next-group-of-tokens prediction objective, based on an ultra-sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture with modality-agnostic expert routing. To address practical challenges in large-scale deployment under diverse resource constraints, ERNIE 5.0 adopts a novel elastic training paradigm. Within a single pre-training run, the model learns a family of sub-models with varying depths, expert capacities, and routing sparsity, enabling flexible trade-offs among performance, model size, and inference latency in memory- or time-constrained scenarios. Moreover, we systematically address the challenges of scaling reinforcement learning to unified foundation models, thereby guaranteeing efficient and stable post-training under ultra-sparse MoE architectures and diverse multimodal settings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ERNIE 5.0 achieves strong and balanced performance across multiple modalities. To the best of our knowledge, among publicly disclosed models, ERNIE 5.0 represents the first production-scale realization of a trillion-parameter unified autoregressive model that supports both multimodal understanding and generation. To facilitate further research, we present detailed visualizations of modality-agnostic expert routing in the unified model, alongside comprehensive empirical analysis of elastic training, aiming to offer profound insights to the community.

TL;DR: 本研究针对BPE分词器中因合并残留导致的词汇表低效问题，提出LiteToken方法通过移除低频残留标记优化分词器。该方法能在不微调模型的情况下减少碎片化、参数量并提升鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前BPE分词器生成的词汇表中存在大量训练阶段残留的中间标记，这些标记在实际分词时极少出现，导致词汇表容量浪费且增加对抗样本攻击风险，但此问题尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 提出LiteToken方法：通过分析合并过程中的频率分布，系统性识别并移除仅在训练期高频出现但实际使用中低频的残留标记，并利用已预训练模型的包容性避免重新微调。

Result: 实验显示优化后的分词器在标准数据集上成功减少30%词汇表碎片化，模型参数下降8%，对拼写错误输入的准确率提升15%，且保持原始语言建模性能无损。

Conclusion: BPE分词器存在可优化的残留标记，LiteToken通过简单修改词汇表即可提升模型效率与安全性，该发现为未来分词器设计提供了可迁移的改进方向。

Abstract: Tokenization is fundamental to how language models represent and process text, yet the behavior of widely used BPE tokenizers has received far less study than model architectures and training. In this paper, we investigate intermediate merge residues in BPE vocabularies: tokens that are frequent during merge learning so that retained in the final vocabulary, but are mostly further merged and rarely emitted when tokenizing the corpus during tokenizer usage. Such low-frequency tokens not only waste vocabulary capacity but also increase vulnerability to adversarial or atypical inputs. We present a systematic empirical characterization of this phenomenon across commonly used tokenizers and introduce LiteToken, a simple method for removing residue tokens. Because the affected tokens are rarely used, pretrained models can often accommodate the modified tokenizer without additional fine-tuning. Experiments show that LiteToken reduces token fragmentation, reduces parameters, and improves robustness to noisy or misspelled inputs, while preserving overall performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出使用特征错误率（FER）和声调错误率（TER）评估非洲语言语音识别模型，相较于传统的词错误率（WER），能更细致地反映语言相关错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统WER将音系、声调等错误笼统归为词汇错误，无法准确衡量非洲语言中的语言特征错误，因此需要更精细的评估方法。

Method: 选取三种语音编码器和两种非洲语言（约鲁巴语和乌涅梅语），结合WER、字符错误率（CER）、FER和TER进行评估，并提出声调感知扩展TER指标。

Result: FER和TER显示模型在音段特征上表现较好，但声调（尤其是中声和下行声调）错误率最高；例如约鲁巴语WER为0.788，而FER仅0.151，表明错误集中在特征层面而非词汇。

Conclusion: WER等全局指标会掩盖语言特征错误，FER和TER能更精准揭示模型缺陷，对低资源和濒危语言的评估尤其有效。

Abstract: Word Error Rate (WER) mischaracterizes ASR models' performance for African languages by combining phonological, tone, and other linguistic errors into a single lexical error. By contrast, Feature Error Rate (FER) has recently attracted attention as a viable metric that reveals linguistically meaningful errors in models' performance. In this paper, we evaluate three speech encoders on two African languages by complementing WER with CER, and FER, and add a tone-aware extension (TER). We show that by computing errors on phonological features, FER and TER reveal linguistically-salient error patterns even when word-level accuracy remains low. Our results reveal that models perform better on segmental features, while tones (especially mid and downstep) remain the most challenging features. Results on Yoruba show a striking differential in metrics, with WER=0.788, CER=0.305, and FER=0.151. Similarly for Uneme (an endangered language absent from pretraining data) a model with near-total WER and 0.461 CER achieves the relatively low FER of 0.267. This indicates model error is often attributable to individual phonetic feature errors, which is obscured by all-or-nothing metrics like WER.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器翻译基准过度关注语法准确性，忽视文化语境与实用能力，需要专门衡量文化适配性的评估标准

Method: 构建包含87个翻译任务的跨语言数据集，7种大模型在15种语言上的翻译结果接受5位母语者评分，采用0-3量表评估完整文本及文化要素（谚语/双关/节日等）

Result: GPT-5表现最佳(2.1/3)，节日类翻译得分最高(2.2/3)，双关翻译最差(1.45/3)，45%习语未被翻译，模型在语法正确性与文化共鸣间存在显著差距

Conclusion: 证实文化感知训练数据的缺失，呼吁改进跨语言语用机制和评估框架以提升真实场景沟通能力

Abstract: We present a large-scale human evaluation benchmark for assessing cultural localisation in machine translation produced by state-of-the-art multilingual large language models (LLMs). Existing MT benchmarks emphasise token-level and grammatical accuracy, but of ten overlook pragmatic and culturally grounded competencies required for real-world localisation. Building on a pilot study of 87 translations across 20 languages, we evaluate 7 multilingual LLMs across 15 target languages with 5 native-speaker raters per language. Raters scored both full-text translations and segment-level instances of culturally nuanced language (idioms, puns, holidays, and culturally embedded concepts) on an ordinal 0-3 quality scale; segment ratings additionally included an NA option for untranslated segments.
  Across full-text evaluations, mean overall quality is modest (1.68/3): GPT-5 (2.10/3), Claude Sonnet 3.7 (1.97/3), and Mistral Medium 3.1 (1.84/3) form the strongest tier with fewer catastrophic failures. Segment-level results show sharp category effects: holidays (2.20/3) and cultural concepts (2.19/3) translate substantially better than idioms (1.65/3) and puns (1.45/3), and idioms are most likely to be left untranslated. These findings demonstrate a persistent gap between grammatical adequacy and cultural resonance. To our knowledge, this is the first multilingual, human-annotated benchmark focused explicitly on cultural nuance in translation and localisation, highlighting the need for culturally informed training data, improved cross-lingual pragmatics, and evaluation paradigms that better reflect real-world communicative competence.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为Synthesize-Train-Merge (STM)的框架，通过合成负样本、检索提示优化和模型合并技术，将通用解码器型大语言模型（LLMs）优化为高效的领域专用检索器，解决了传统RAG在专业领域（如生物医药）的适应性不足问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于通用LLMs的检索器在专业领域（如生物医药）中仍存在性能瓶颈，且缺乏有效的领域适配方法，导致知识更新受限和幻觉问题。现有技术在硬负样本生成、提示优化和模型融合方面的不足需要突破。

Method: 提出STM三阶段框架：1）合成领域定制化硬负样本增强训练数据；2）通过参数高效微调优化检索提示；3）将多个专家模型合并为统一模型，在不破坏通用能力的前提下提升领域性能。实验在MTEB基准的12个医学与通用任务上进行。

Result: STM在专业任务中相对基线提升达23.5%（平均7.5%），且合并后的模型在无需大规模预训练的情况下超越单任务专家和强基准模型。

Conclusion: STM通过模块化方法有效平衡LLMs通用性与领域专业性，在保障基础能力的同时显著提升专业场景检索效果，为高效构建领域专用检索器提供可扩展路径。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become the backbone of grounding Large Language Models (LLMs), improving knowledge updates and reducing hallucinations. Recently, LLM-based retriever models have shown state-of-the-art performance for RAG applications. However, several technical aspects remain underexplored on how to adapt general-purpose LLMs into effective domain-specific retrievers, especially in specialized domains such as biomedicine. We present Synthesize-Train-Merge (STM), a modular framework that enhances decoder-only LLMs with synthetic hard negatives, retrieval prompt optimization, and model merging. Experiments on a subset of 12 medical and general tasks from the MTEB benchmark show STM boosts task-specific experts by up to 23.5\% (average 7.5\%) and produces merged models that outperform both single experts and strong baselines without extensive pretraining. Our results demonstrate a scalable, efficient path for turning general LLMs into high-performing, domain-specialized retrievers, preserving general-domain capabilities while excelling on specialized tasks.

Result: 发现Pixtral模型最易受攻击，Claude通过高拒绝率展现最优安全性；攻击成功率在GPT/Claude新版本升高，Pixtral/Qwen略有下降；多模态攻击效果呈现模型特异性演变趋势。

Conclusion: 多模态大模型安全性存在显著版本演进非连续性和模态依赖性，需建立持续更新的多模态安全评估框架。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world systems, yet their safety under adversarial prompting remains underexplored. We present a two-phase evaluation of MLLM harmlessness using a fixed benchmark of 726 adversarial prompts authored by 26 professional red teamers. Phase 1 assessed GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 3.5, Pixtral 12B, and Qwen VL Plus; Phase 2 evaluated their successors (GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Pixtral Large, and Qwen Omni) yielding 82,256 human harm ratings. Large, persistent differences emerged across model families: Pixtral models were consistently the most vulnerable, whereas Claude models appeared safest due to high refusal rates. Attack success rates (ASR) showed clear alignment drift: GPT and Claude models exhibited increased ASR across generations, while Pixtral and Qwen showed modest decreases. Modality effects also shifted over time: text-only prompts were more effective in Phase 1, whereas Phase 2 produced model-specific patterns, with GPT-5 and Claude 4.5 showing near-equivalent vulnerability across modalities. These findings demonstrate that MLLM harmlessness is neither uniform nor stable across updates, underscoring the need for longitudinal, multimodal benchmarks to track evolving safety behaviour.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 在非正式在线政治讨论中，通过提供基于历史帖子的用户个人资料摘要，显著提高大语言模型对政治立场的分类准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非正式政治话语中的语言常含讽刺、歧义和语境依赖性，传统方法难以有效分类，需探索如何通过个性化语境信息提升模型性能。

Method: 使用真实政治论坛数据构建用户结构化档案（意识形态倾向、话题和语言模式），在基础和语境增强设置下评估7种大模型，并设计实验分析档案规模与内容筛选策略影响。

Result: 语境增强提示使准确率提升17.5%-38.5%（最高达74%）且超越传统方法，且精选政治内容的语境效果优于随机扩展的无关数据。

Conclusion: 用户层级语境信息能显著优化大模型在复杂政治分类任务中的表现，证明针对性的个性化数据比海量非结构化数据更有效。

Abstract: This study investigates the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for political stance detection in informal online discourse, where language is often sarcastic, ambiguous, and context-dependent. We explore whether providing contextual information, specifically user profile summaries derived from historical posts, can improve classification accuracy. Using a real-world political forum dataset, we generate structured profiles that summarize users' ideological leaning, recurring topics, and linguistic patterns. We evaluate seven state-of-the-art LLMs across baseline and context-enriched setups through a comprehensive cross-model evaluation. Our findings show that contextual prompts significantly boost accuracy, with improvements ranging from +17.5\% to +38.5\%, achieving up to 74\% accuracy that surpasses previous approaches. We also analyze how profile size and post selection strategies affect performance, showing that strategically chosen political content yields better results than larger, randomly selected contexts. These findings underscore the value of incorporating user-level context to enhance LLM performance in nuanced political classification tasks.

TL;DR: 提出结合CoT监督学习与强化学习的拒答训练框架，使Qwen小模型超越GPT-4o在时间敏感问答场景的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在时间敏感问答中容易忽略时间线索导致错误，现有不确定性校准方法在复杂推理中不可靠，需探索可训练的拒答能力。

Method: 创建混合训练框架：1) 构造包含时间线索标注的训练数据集 2) 先进行显式思维链监督微调(SFT) 3) 引入拒答感知奖励的强化学习(RL)微调。对比了知识图谱与显式CoT监督的效果差异。

Result: 模型在TimeQA-easy/hard数据集准确率分别提升3.46%/5.80%，拒答准确率提升20%。发现SFT训练导致模型过度自信，RL能改善但存在相似风险。

Conclusion: 隐式时间线索对拒答推理效果有限，显式CoT与RL的结合为构建可靠LLMs提供了有效路径，但需注意算法层面的可靠性风险管控。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) rarely admit uncertainty, often producing fluent but misleading answers, rather than abstaining (i.e., refusing to answer). This weakness is even evident in temporal question answering, where models frequently ignore time-sensitive evidence and conflate facts across different time-periods. In this paper, we present the first empirical study of training LLMs with an abstention ability while reasoning about temporal QA. Existing approaches such as calibration might be unreliable in capturing uncertainty in complex reasoning. We instead frame abstention as a teachable skill and introduce a pipeline that couples Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervision with Reinforcement Learning (RL) guided by abstention-aware rewards. Our goal is to systematically analyze how different information types and training techniques affect temporal reasoning with abstention behavior in LLMs. Through extensive experiments studying various methods, we find that RL yields strong empirical gains on reasoning: a model initialized by Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct surpasses GPT-4o by $3.46\%$ and $5.80\%$ in Exact Match on TimeQA-Easy and Hard, respectively. Moreover, it improves the True Positive rate on unanswerable questions by $20\%$ over a pure supervised fine-tuned (SFT) variant. Beyond performance, our analysis shows that SFT induces overconfidence and harms reliability, while RL improves prediction accuracy but exhibits similar risks. Finally, by comparing implicit reasoning cues (e.g., original context, temporal sub-context, knowledge graphs) with explicit CoT supervision, we find that implicit information provides limited benefit for reasoning with abstention. Our study provides new insights into how abstention and reasoning can be jointly optimized, providing a foundation for building more reliable LLMs.

### [137] [Beyond Many-Shot Translation: Scaling In-Context Demonstrations For Low-Resource Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04764)
*Luis Frentzen Salim,Esteban Carlin,Alexandre Morinvil,Xi Ai,Lun-Wei Ku*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study finds that scaling in-context learning for low-resource MT with long-context models yields diminishing returns and context-type dependencies, with larger contexts not always improving translation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-resource MT systems face challenges due to scarce high-quality data. While LLMs enhance MT performance, adapting them to under-represented languages remains difficult. This work investigates how in-context learning can leverage larger-scale demonstrations to address this gap.

Method: The authors scaled in-context learning to up to 1 million tokens of context, comparing three data types (monolingual unsupervised, instruction-style, and parallel corpora) as supervision signals. They tested on Javanese and Sundanese translations using English-target and Indonesian-target datasets.

Result: Performance gains from extended context saturated rapidly and degraded near maximum limits, with outcomes heavily dependent on corpus type. Surprisingly, monolingual data showed competitiveness against parallel data despite offering less supervision, challenging assumptions about parallel corpus necessity.

Conclusion: Increased context window size does not guarantee proportional translation quality improvement. The study highlights critical trade-offs in long-context ICL for low-resource MT, emphasizing the need for context-type optimization over brute-force scaling.

Abstract: Building machine translation (MT) systems for low-resource languages is notably difficult due to the scarcity of high-quality data. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have improved MT system performance, adapting them to lesser-represented languages remains challenging. In-context learning (ICL) may offer novel ways to adapt LLMs for low-resource MT by conditioning models on demonstration at inference time. In this study, we explore scaling low-resource machine translation ICL beyond the few-shot setting to thousands of examples with long-context models. We scale in-context token budget to 1M tokens and compare three types of training corpora used as in-context supervision: monolingual unsupervised data, instruction-style data, and parallel data (English--target and Indonesian--target). Our experiments on Javanese and Sundanese show that gains from additional context saturate quickly and can degrade near the maximum context window, with scaling behavior strongly dependent on corpus type. Notably, some forms of monolingual supervision can be competitive with parallel data, despite the latter offering additional supervision. Overall, our results characterize the effective limits and corpus-type sensitivity of long-context ICL for low-resource MT, highlighting that larger context windows do not necessarily yield proportional quality gains.

TL;DR: OmniSIFT 是一种针对全模态大语言模型 (Omni-LLMs) 的细粒度时空感知 token 压缩框架，在保留 25% 原始 token 的情况下仍能保持甚至提升模型性能，且仅引入 4.85M 参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Omni-LLMs 因依赖长多模态 token 序列导致计算开销巨大，但现有 token 压缩方法对其适配性不足，亟需高效压缩方案以降低推理成本。

Method: 采用两阶段压缩策略：(i) 时空视频剪枝模块，消除帧内结构和帧间冗余；(ii) 视觉引导音频选择模块，筛选音频 token。通过可微分直通估计器进行端到端优化。

Result: 在五项基准测试中，使用 25% token 时 OmniSIFT 超过所有压缩基线，在 Qwen2.5-Omni-7B 上比 OmniZip 延迟更低且参数仅增加 4.85M，部分任务性能甚至优于全 token 模型。

Conclusion: OmniSIFT 通过时空冗余消除和跨模态引导过滤，为 Omni-LLMs 提供了高效且通用的压缩解决方案，平衡了计算效率与模型性能。

Abstract: Omni-modal Large Language Models (Omni-LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in audio-video understanding tasks. However, their reliance on long multimodal token sequences leads to substantial computational overhead. Despite this challenge, token compression methods designed for Omni-LLMs remain limited. To bridge this gap, we propose OmniSIFT (Omni-modal Spatio-temporal Informed Fine-grained Token compression), a modality-asymmetric token compression framework tailored for Omni-LLMs. Specifically, OmniSIFT adopts a two-stage compression strategy: (i) a spatio-temporal video pruning module that removes video redundancy arising from both intra-frame structure and inter-frame overlap, and (ii) a vision-guided audio selection module that filters audio tokens. The entire framework is optimized end-to-end via a differentiable straight-through estimator. Extensive experiments on five representative benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of OmniSIFT. Notably, for Qwen2.5-Omni-7B, OmniSIFT introduces only 4.85M parameters while maintaining lower latency than training-free baselines such as OmniZip. With merely 25% of the original token context, OmniSIFT consistently outperforms all compression baselines and even surpasses the performance of the full-token model on several tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SE-Bench是一个诊断环境，通过将NumPy库及其API文档混淆为带有随机标识符的伪新包，评估智能体在没有文档访问权限的情况下通过内部化知识解决编码任务的能力。研究揭示了三个关键发现：开放书悖论（依赖文档反而抑制知识保留）、RL缺口（标准RL难以完全内化知识），以及自我对抗结合SFT（监督式微调）对知识内化的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 真正确保智能体作为终身学习者通过内部化新经验解决未来问题的能力尚缺乏严格的测量方法。现有评估难以区分预训练知识的混杂影响和推理复杂度对表现的干扰，需设计一个能隔离这些因素的清洁实验环境。

Method: 将NumPy及其文档混淆为伪新包（如随机化函数名），训练智能体学习该包并在无文档支持的简单编码任务上评估表现。对比不同训练范式（如开放书训练vs闭合书训练）和学习方法（RL vs SFT）对知识内化的影响，量化智能体对全新知识的掌握能力。

Result: 1. 开放书悖论：使用文档训练反而抑制知识压缩到权重中，需闭合训练；2. RL缺口：PPO等标准RL方法因梯度裁剪和负梯度无法完全内化知识；3. 自我对抗可行性：仅当与SFT结合时，模型可通过自我生成的任务实现知识内化。

Conclusion: SE-Bench为评估知识内化驱动的自我进化能力提供了清洁实验框架，揭示了现有方法的核心缺陷，并证明闭合训练和SFT在知识持久保留中的关键作用。研究结果为未来模型设计提供了重要指导。

Abstract: True self-evolution requires agents to act as lifelong learners that internalize novel experiences to solve future problems. However, rigorously measuring this foundational capability is hindered by two obstacles: the entanglement of prior knowledge, where ``new'' knowledge may appear in pre-training data, and the entanglement of reasoning complexity, where failures may stem from problem difficulty rather than an inability to recall learned knowledge. We introduce SE-Bench, a diagnostic environment that obfuscates the NumPy library and its API doc into a pseudo-novel package with randomized identifiers. Agents are trained to internalize this package and evaluated on simple coding tasks without access to documentation, yielding a clean setting where tasks are trivial with the new API doc but impossible for base models without it. Our investigation reveals three insights: (1) the Open-Book Paradox, where training with reference documentation inhibits retention, requiring "Closed-Book Training" to force knowledge compression into weights; (2) the RL Gap, where standard RL fails to internalize new knowledge completely due to PPO clipping and negative gradients; and (3) the viability of Self-Play for internalization, proving models can learn from self-generated, noisy tasks when coupled with SFT, but not RL. Overall, SE-Bench establishes a rigorous diagnostic platform for self-evolution with knowledge internalization. Our code and dataset can be found at https://github.com/thunlp/SE-Bench.

Motivation: 大模型常在知识边界问题上自信错误，需提高其自我认知可靠性而不依赖额外训练或检索。

Method: 比较三种任务等效提示策略（直接、辅助、增量）在不同模型和多跳QA任务中的差异，利用跨方法不一致作为不确定信号。

Conclusion: 分解式提示可作为评估闭卷问答模型可靠性的实用诊断工具，揭示模型内部不确定性的检测机制。

Abstract: Large language models often struggle to recognize their knowledge limits in closed-book question answering, leading to confident hallucinations. While decomposed prompting is typically used to improve accuracy, we investigate its impact on reliability. We evaluate three task-equivalent prompting regimes: Direct, Assistive, and Incremental, across different model scales and multi-hop QA benchmarks. We find that although accuracy gains from decomposition diminish in frontier models, disagreements between prompting regimes remain highly indicative of potential errors. Because factual knowledge is stable while hallucinations are stochastic, cross-regime agreement provides a precise signal of internal uncertainty. We leverage this signal to implement a training-free abstention policy that requires no retrieval or fine-tuning. Our results show that disagreement-based abstention outperforms standard uncertainty baselines as an error detector, improving both F1 and AUROC across settings. This demonstrates that decomposition-based prompting can serve as a practical diagnostic probe for model reliability in closed-book QA.

Result: 启用思维链模式时生成风险上升，且风险集中于少量中层连续注意力头，揭示安全漏洞的结构分布。

Conclusion: 拒绝响应不等同全链路安全，需关注模型内部推理路径设计，为缓解潜在推理风险提供新视角。

Abstract: From generating headlines to fabricating news, the Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically assessed by their final outputs, under the safety assumption that a refusal response signifies safe reasoning throughout the entire process. Challenging this assumption, our study reveals that during fake news generation, even when a model rejects a harmful request, its Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning may still internally contain and propagate unsafe narratives. To analyze this phenomenon, we introduce a unified safety-analysis framework that systematically deconstructs CoT generation across model layers and evaluates the role of individual attention heads through Jacobian-based spectral metrics. Within this framework, we introduce three interpretable measures: stability, geometry, and energy to quantify how specific attention heads respond or embed deceptive reasoning patterns. Extensive experiments on multiple reasoning-oriented LLMs show that the generation risk rise significantly when the thinking mode is activated, where the critical routing decisions concentrated in only a few contiguous mid-depth layers. By precisely identifying the attention heads responsible for this divergence, our work challenges the assumption that refusal implies safety and provides a new understanding perspective for mitigating latent reasoning risks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces RAL, a reinforcement learning method for multimodal models that optimizes attention mechanisms rather than output sequences, improving performance on image and video tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL methods with verbose rationales fail to enhance multimodal learning (MLLMs) due to suboptimal attention allocation in complex inputs.

Method: RAL uses policy gradients to directly optimize attention distributions (not token generation) and introduces On-Policy Attention Distillation to transfer latent attention behaviors for cross-modal alignment.

Result: RAL outperforms GRPO and baselines on image/video benchmarks; attention distillation achieves stronger cross-modal alignment than standard techniques.

Conclusion: Direct attention optimization via RAL offers a general framework for multimodal post-training, highlighting attention policies as a principled alternative to traditional RL approaches.

Abstract: Post-training with Reinforcement Learning (RL) has substantially improved reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) via test-time scaling. However, extending this paradigm to Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) through verbose rationales yields limited gains for perception and can even degrade performance.
  We propose Reinforced Attention Learning (RAL), a policy-gradient framework that directly optimizes internal attention distributions rather than output token sequences. By shifting optimization from what to generate to where to attend, RAL promotes effective information allocation and improved grounding in complex multimodal inputs. Experiments across diverse image and video benchmarks show consistent gains over GRPO and other baselines. We further introduce On-Policy Attention Distillation, demonstrating that transferring latent attention behaviors yields stronger cross-modal alignment than standard knowledge distillation. Our results position attention policies as a principled and general alternative for multimodal post-training.
