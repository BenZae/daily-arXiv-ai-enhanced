### [1] [Multi-encoder ConvNeXt Network with Smooth Attentional Feature Fusion for Multispectral Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10137)
*Leo Thomas Ramos,Angel D. Sappa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MeCSAFNet是一种多分支编码器-解码器架构，专为多光谱影像土地覆盖分割设计，结合双ConvNeXt编码器、融合解码器及注意力机制，在主流数据集上显著优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多光谱影像包含可见光与非可见光通道（如近红外、植被指数），传统模型难以高效融合多尺度光谱-空间特征，且模型复杂度高，限制了资源受限场景的应用。

Method: 1. 双编码器分支：分别处理可见光（RGB）与非可见光通道（NIR/NDVI/NDWI）；2. 融合解码器：多尺度特征交互；3. 引入CBAM注意力及ASAU激活函数增强特征表达；4. 支持4c/6c输入配置（RGB+NIR或额外加入NDVI/NDWI）。

Result: 在FBP数据集上，MeCSAFNet-base (6c)的mIoU超越U-Net/SegFormer等基线模型14.72%-19.62%；Potsdam数据集上MeCSAFNet-large (4c)提升4.80%-9.11%。轻量化版本在降低训练时间和推理成本下仍保持高性能。

Conclusion: MeCSAFNet通过分而治之的多分支架构与高效特征融合机制，在准确率与效率间实现平衡，尤其适用于多光谱数据丰富的遥感场景，且轻量化设计支持边缘部署。

Abstract: This work proposes MeCSAFNet, a multi-branch encoder-decoder architecture for land cover segmentation in multispectral imagery. The model separately processes visible and non-visible channels through dual ConvNeXt encoders, followed by individual decoders that reconstruct spatial information. A dedicated fusion decoder integrates intermediate features at multiple scales, combining fine spatial cues with high-level spectral representations. The feature fusion is further enhanced with CBAM attention, and the ASAU activation function contributes to stable and efficient optimization. The model is designed to process different spectral configurations, including a 4-channel (4c) input combining RGB and NIR bands, as well as a 6-channel (6c) input incorporating NDVI and NDWI indices. Experiments on the Five-Billion-Pixels (FBP) and Potsdam datasets demonstrate significant performance gains. On FBP, MeCSAFNet-base (6c) surpasses U-Net (4c) by +19.21%, U-Net (6c) by +14.72%, SegFormer (4c) by +19.62%, and SegFormer (6c) by +14.74% in mIoU. On Potsdam, MeCSAFNet-large (4c) improves over DeepLabV3+ (4c) by +6.48%, DeepLabV3+ (6c) by +5.85%, SegFormer (4c) by +9.11%, and SegFormer (6c) by +4.80% in mIoU. The model also achieves consistent gains over several recent state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, compact variants of MeCSAFNet deliver notable performance with lower training time and reduced inference cost, supporting their deployment in resource-constrained environments.

### [2] [Multimodal Information Fusion for Chart Understanding: A Survey of MLLMs -- Evolution, Limitations, and Cognitive Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10138)
*Zhihang Yi,Jian Zhao,Jiancheng Lv,Tao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This survey reviews the state-of-the-art in MLLM-based chart understanding, organizing challenges, tasks, and methods to provide a structured roadmap for future research and applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chart understanding requires integrating visual and textual data, but existing MLLM research in this field lacks systematic organization, prompting the need for a comprehensive framework to advance the domain.

Method: The authors analyze core challenges in visual-language fusion, propose a novel taxonomy of canonical/non-canonical benchmarks, and trace methodological evolution from traditional deep learning to advanced MLLM fusion strategies through a systematic literature review.

Result: A structured domain organization was established, revealing field expansion through new benchmark categories, exposing current model limitations in perceptual reasoning, and identifying alignment techniques and reinforcement learning as key future directions.

Conclusion: MLLMs are transforming chart information fusion, but systematic understanding of their capabilities and limitations remains critical for developing more robust, reliable systems - this survey provides foundational guidance for addressing these challenges.

Abstract: Chart understanding is a quintessential information fusion task, requiring the seamless integration of graphical and textual data to extract meaning. The advent of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has revolutionized this domain, yet the landscape of MLLM-based chart analysis remains fragmented and lacks systematic organization. This survey provides a comprehensive roadmap of this nascent frontier by structuring the domain's core components. We begin by analyzing the fundamental challenges of fusing visual and linguistic information in charts. We then categorize downstream tasks and datasets, introducing a novel taxonomy of canonical and non-canonical benchmarks to highlight the field's expanding scope. Subsequently, we present a comprehensive evolution of methodologies, tracing the progression from classic deep learning techniques to state-of-the-art MLLM paradigms that leverage sophisticated fusion strategies. By critically examining the limitations of current models, particularly their perceptual and reasoning deficits, we identify promising future directions, including advanced alignment techniques and reinforcement learning for cognitive enhancement. This survey aims to equip researchers and practitioners with a structured understanding of how MLLMs are transforming chart information fusion and to catalyze progress toward more robust and reliable systems.

### [3] [MPA: Multimodal Prototype Augmentation for Few-Shot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10143)
*Liwen Wu,Wei Wang,Lei Zhao,Zhan Gao,Qika Lin,Shaowen Yao,Zuozhu Liu,Bin Pu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为MPA的多模态原型增强少样本学习框架，通过语义增强、多视角特征优化和不确定性建模提升分类性能，单域和跨域设置下分别超越现有方法12.29%和24.56%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有少样本学习方法过度依赖单一视觉模态（如图像），缺乏多模态（如文本描述、增强视角）信息整合，导致特征表达受限。

Method: MPA包含三个模块：1) LMSE利用大语言模型生成多样化类别描述补充语义信息；2) HMA结合自然与多视角增强（视角距离、光照等）提升特征多样性；3) AUCA通过插值与高斯采样建模不确定性，吸收边界模糊样本。

Result: 在4个单域与6个跨域少样本学习基准中，MPA在5-way 1-shot模式下分别取得12.29%和24.56%的准确率提升，且多模态融合策略显著优于纯视觉方法。

Conclusion: MPA证明了多模态信息融合、语义扩展及不确定性建模对少样本学习的有效性，尤其在跨域任务中优势明显，为模型泛化性提供新思路。

Abstract: Recently, few-shot learning (FSL) has become a popular task that aims to recognize new classes from only a few labeled examples and has been widely applied in fields such as natural science, remote sensing, and medical images. However, most existing methods focus only on the visual modality and compute prototypes directly from raw support images, which lack comprehensive and rich multimodal information. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Multimodal Prototype Augmentation FSL framework called MPA, including LLM-based Multi-Variant Semantic Enhancement (LMSE), Hierarchical Multi-View Augmentation (HMA), and an Adaptive Uncertain Class Absorber (AUCA). LMSE leverages large language models to generate diverse paraphrased category descriptions, enriching the support set with additional semantic cues. HMA exploits both natural and multi-view augmentations to enhance feature diversity (e.g., changes in viewing distance, camera angles, and lighting conditions). AUCA models uncertainty by introducing uncertain classes via interpolation and Gaussian sampling, effectively absorbing uncertain samples. Extensive experiments on four single-domain and six cross-domain FSL benchmarks demonstrate that MPA achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods across most settings. Notably, MPA surpasses the second-best method by 12.29% and 24.56% in the single-domain and cross-domain setting, respectively, in the 5-way 1-shot setting.

### [4] [VERA: Identifying and Leveraging Visual Evidence Retrieval Heads in Long-Context Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10146)
*Rongcan Pei,Huan Li,Fang Guo,Qi Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本论文分析了视觉语言模型(VLMs)在处理长上下文时的瓶颈，发现了一类负责检索视觉证据的动态注意力头(VER Heads)，并提出无需训练的VEA框架通过显式描述这些头关注的内容，使两个主流VLM的长文本理解能力平均提升超20%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs在复杂推理和长文本处理中存在显著性能瓶颈，尤其在结合视觉证据与文本推理时效率低下。本文旨在通过分析模型内部机制，定位影响长上下文处理的核心因素，并提出优化方案。

Method: 通过注意力分析定位到负责动态检索视觉线索的VER注意力头，验证其对模型性能的因果关系(遮蔽实验导致性能下降)。基于此提出VEA框架，利用模型不确定性(熵值)检测触发机制，强制模型用文本显式描述VER头关注的视觉证据，且无需额外训练。

Result: 在Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct和GLM-4.1V-Thinking两个模型上，VEA框架在五项基准测试中分别实现21.3%和20.1%的相对性能提升，显著增强长文本与复杂推理场景下的视觉证据利用效率。

Conclusion: VER注意力头是VLM长上下文处理的关键组件，VEA证明显式建模视觉证据检索过程能有效突破当前性能瓶颈，为开源VLM提供无需训练的通用增强方案。

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promise in textual understanding, they face significant challenges when handling long context and complex reasoning tasks. In this paper, we dissect the internal mechanisms governing long-context processing in VLMs to understand their performance bottlenecks. Through the lens of attention analysis, we identify specific Visual Evidence Retrieval (VER) Heads - a sparse, dynamic set of attention heads critical for locating visual cues during reasoning, distinct from static OCR heads. We demonstrate that these heads are causal to model performance; masking them leads to significant degradation. Leveraging this discovery, we propose VERA (Visual Evidence Retrieval Augmentation), a training-free framework that detects model uncertainty (i.e., entropy) to trigger the explicit verbalization of visual evidence attended by VER heads. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that VERA significantly improves long-context understanding of open-source VLMs: it yields an average relative improvement of 21.3% on Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct and 20.1% on GLM-4.1V-Thinking across five benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于交互式工具的3D高斯点云编辑方法，结合AI驱动的2D掩码传播与手动分割工具，实现在野外捕获场景中的可控对象提取与编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯点云（3DGS）的自动分割与编辑技术受限，尤其是从复杂场景中提取可编辑对象存在挑战，传统方法侧重自动化或高层次编辑，缺乏用户干预能力。

Method: 提出快速AI驱动的2D-3D掩码传播算法，并设计灵活的3DGS手动选择与分割工具，结合视频扩散模型实现用户引导的局部编辑。

Result: 工具集在3DGS分割任务中达到SOTA效果，支持任意非结构化场景的二值分割，并证明其在物理模拟和动画等下游任务中的实用性，且无需额外优化。

Conclusion: 交互式工具集平衡了自动化与用户控制，为3DGS编辑提供直接且普适的解决方案，适用于各类野外捕获场景。

Abstract: Representation in the family of 3D Gaussian Splats (3DGS) are growing into a viable alternative to traditional graphics for an expanding number of application, including recent techniques that facilitate physics simulation and animation. However, extracting usable objects from in-the-wild captures remains challenging and controllable editing techniques for this representation are limited. Unlike the bulk of emerging techniques, focused on automatic solutions or high-level editing, we introduce an interactive suite of tools centered around versatile Gaussian Splat selection and segmentation. We propose a fast AI-driven method to propagate user-guided 2D selection masks to 3DGS selections. This technique allows for user intervention in the case of errors and is further coupled with flexible manual selection and segmentation tools. These allow a user to achieve virtually any binary segmentation of an unstructured 3DGS scene. We evaluate our toolset against the state-of-the-art for Gaussian Splat selection and demonstrate their utility for downstream applications by developing a user-guided local editing approach, leveraging a custom Video Diffusion Model. With flexible selection tools, users have direct control over the areas that the AI can modify. Our selection and editing tools can be used for any in-the-wild capture without additional optimization.

### [6] [When the Prompt Becomes Visual: Vision-Centric Jailbreak Attacks for Large Image Editing Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10179)
*Jiacheng Hou,Yining Sun,Ruochong Jin,Haochen Han,Fangming Liu,Wai Kin Victor Chan,Alex Jinpeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新型视觉到视觉的越狱攻击(VJA)，通过视觉提示而非文本指令即可传递恶意意图，并引入了IESBench基准测试来评估图像编辑模型的安全性。研究展示了对多个商业模型的高攻击成功率，并提出了一种无需额外训练、基于多模态推理的防御方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉提示编辑（如通过绘图、标注修改图像）扩大了易用性，但引入了新的安全风险：攻击者可通过视觉输入直接植入恶意指令。这种‘视觉即攻击面’的威胁尚未被充分研究。

Method: 1）设计仅依赖视觉输入的VJA攻击框架；2）构建安全评测基准IESBench；3）提出基于多模态模型自省能力的防御方案（无需训练或额外防护模型）；4）在真实商业模型上测试攻击效果。

Result: VJA在Nano Banana Pro/GPT-Image-1.5模型上攻击成功率分别达80.9%/70.1%；防御方法使脆弱模型安全性提升至商业系统水平，且计算开销可忽略（<5%）。

Conclusion: 发现视觉提示编辑范式存在结构性安全漏洞，首次揭示视觉输入可能成为攻击载体的风险，并提供从评测到防御的完整解决方案，为构建可信图像编辑系统奠定基础。

Abstract: Recent advances in large image editing models have shifted the paradigm from text-driven instructions to vision-prompt editing, where user intent is inferred directly from visual inputs such as marks, arrows, and visual-text prompts. While this paradigm greatly expands usability, it also introduces a critical and underexplored safety risk: the attack surface itself becomes visual. In this work, we propose Vision-Centric Jailbreak Attack (VJA), the first visual-to-visual jailbreak attack that conveys malicious instructions purely through visual inputs. To systematically study this emerging threat, we introduce IESBench, a safety-oriented benchmark for image editing models. Extensive experiments on IESBench demonstrate that VJA effectively compromises state-of-the-art commercial models, achieving attack success rates of up to 80.9% on Nano Banana Pro and 70.1% on GPT-Image-1.5. To mitigate this vulnerability, we propose a training-free defense based on introspective multimodal reasoning, which substantially improves the safety of poorly aligned models to a level comparable with commercial systems, without auxiliary guard models and with negligible computational overhead. Our findings expose new vulnerabilities, provide both a benchmark and practical defense to advance safe and trustworthy modern image editing systems. Warning: This paper contains offensive images created by large image editing models.

Abstract: This study introduces a new object detection dataset of pedestrians using mobility aids, named PMMA. The dataset was collected in an outdoor environment, where volunteers used wheelchairs, canes, and walkers, resulting in nine categories of pedestrians: pedestrians, cane users, two types of walker users, whether walking or resting, five types of wheelchair users, including wheelchair users, people pushing empty wheelchairs, and three types of users pushing occupied wheelchairs, including the entire pushing group, the pusher and the person seated on the wheelchair. To establish a benchmark, seven object detection models (Faster R-CNN, CenterNet, YOLOX, DETR, Deformable DETR, DINO, and RT-DETR) and three tracking algorithms (ByteTrack, BOT-SORT, and OC-SORT) were implemented under the MMDetection framework. Experimental results show that YOLOX, Deformable DETR, and Faster R-CNN achieve the best detection performance, while the differences among the three trackers are relatively small. The PMMA dataset is publicly available at https://doi.org/10.5683/SP3/XJPQUG, and the video processing and model training code is available at https://github.com/DatasetPMMA/PMMA.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ERGO框架，通过动态调整损失权重和引入几何纹理感知目标，从单图生成高质量3D内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以有效利用不完全监督信号，生成的辅助视角存在几何和纹理错误，导致3D重建质量下降。

Method: ERGO分解决失风险为多余风险和贝叶斯误差，动态评估视角相关风险并调整损失权重；结合几何/纹理感知目标，构建全局-局部协同优化范式。

Result: 在Google Scanned Objects和OmniObject3D数据集上，几何精度和纹理质量均优于现有SOTA方法。

Conclusion: ERGO在抑制监督噪声干扰的同时，显著提升了单目3D重建的几何保真度和纹理质量。

Abstract: Generating 3D content from a single image remains a fundamentally challenging and ill-posed problem due to the inherent absence of geometric and textural information in occluded regions. While state-of-the-art generative models can synthesize auxiliary views to provide additional supervision, these views inevitably contain geometric inconsistencies and textural misalignments that propagate and amplify artifacts during 3D reconstruction. To effectively harness these imperfect supervisory signals, we propose an adaptive optimization framework guided by excess risk decomposition, termed ERGO. Specifically, ERGO decomposes the optimization losses in 3D Gaussian splatting into two components, i.e., excess risk that quantifies the suboptimality gap between current and optimal parameters, and Bayes error that models the irreducible noise inherent in synthesized views. This decomposition enables ERGO to dynamically estimate the view-specific excess risk and adaptively adjust loss weights during optimization. Furthermore, we introduce geometry-aware and texture-aware objectives that complement the excess-risk-derived weighting mechanism, establishing a synergistic global-local optimization paradigm. Consequently, ERGO demonstrates robustness against supervision noise while consistently enhancing both geometric fidelity and textural quality of the reconstructed 3D content. Extensive experiments on the Google Scanned Objects dataset and the OmniObject3D dataset demonstrate the superiority of ERGO over existing state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为Low-Rank Defense（LoRD）的高效防御策略，用于抵御潜在扩散模型（LDMs）的对抗攻击，通过低秩自适应（LoRA）模块结合合并思路与平衡参数，有效检测并防御对抗样本。

Conclusion: LoRD是一种轻量级且有效的防御策略，通过低秩参数调整与模块合并机制，实现了在不损失生成质量的前提下对抗攻击的防御目标，为扩散模型的实际应用提供了安全保障。

Abstract: Recently, adversarial attacks for diffusion models as well as their fine-tuning process have been developed rapidly. To prevent the abuse of these attack algorithms from affecting the practical application of diffusion models, it is critical to develop corresponding defensive strategies. In this work, we propose an efficient defensive strategy, named Low-Rank Defense (LoRD), to defend the adversarial attack on Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs). LoRD introduces the merging idea and a balance parameter, combined with the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) modules, to detect and defend the adversarial samples. Based on LoRD, we build up a defense pipeline that applies the learned LoRD modules to help diffusion models defend against attack algorithms. Our method ensures that the LDM fine-tuned on both adversarial and clean samples can still generate high-quality images. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on facial and landscape images, and our method shows significantly better defense performance compared to the baseline methods.

### [10] [Flow Matching with Uncertainty Quantification and Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10326)
*Juyeop Han,Lukas Lao Beyer,Sertac Karaman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UA-Flow改进生成模型，通过预测速度场和异方差不确定性生成高质量样本，并利用不确定性信号提升生成可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统flow matching模型生成样本质量不稳定，需要一种方法能同时衡量样本可靠性和提升生成质量。

Method: 在flow matching基础上扩展UA-Flow模型，通过传播速度不确定性动态估计样本级可靠性，结合分类器引导与无分类器引导进行不确定性感知采样。

Result: 不确定性信号与样本保真度相关性高于基线方法，且不确定性引导的采样进一步提升了生成质量。

Conclusion: UA-Flow成功解决了生成可靠性问题，通过动态不确定性建模和引导策略显著优化图像生成效果。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of sampling-based generative models such as flow matching, they can still produce samples of inconsistent or degraded quality. To assess sample reliability and generate higher-quality outputs, we propose uncertainty-aware flow matching (UA-Flow), a lightweight extension of flow matching that predicts the velocity field together with heteroscedastic uncertainty. UA-Flow estimates per-sample uncertainty by propagating velocity uncertainty through the flow dynamics. These uncertainty estimates act as a reliability signal for individual samples, and we further use them to steer generation via uncertainty-aware classifier guidance and classifier-free guidance. Experiments on image generation show that UA-Flow produces uncertainty signals more highly correlated with sample fidelity than baseline methods, and that uncertainty-guided sampling further improves generation quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为PGD-MC的随机线性代数方法，用于相干成像中的最大似然估计（MLE）重建，通过避免显式矩阵求逆实现高效优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Conclusion: PGD-MC框架为有限孔径数字全息成像提供了灵活且高效的MLE重建方案，解决了传统方法对计算资源的限制问题。

Abstract: In coherent imaging, speckle is statistically modeled as multiplicative noise, posing a fundamental challenge for image reconstruction. While maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) provides a principled framework for speckle mitigation, its application to coherent imaging system such as digital holography with finite apertures is hindered by the prohibitive cost of high-dimensional matrix inversion, especially at high resolutions. This computational burden has prevented the use of MLE-based reconstruction with physically accurate aperture modeling. In this work, we propose a randomized linear algebra approach that enables scalable MLE optimization without explicit matrix inversions in gradient computation. By exploiting the structural properties of sensing matrix and using conjugate gradient for likelihood gradient evaluation, the proposed algorithm supports accurate aperture modeling without the simplifying assumptions commonly imposed for tractability. We term the resulting method projected gradient descent with Monte Carlo estimation (PGD-MC). The proposed PGD-MC framework (i) demonstrates robustness to diverse and physically accurate aperture models, (ii) achieves substantial improvements in reconstruction quality and computational efficiency, and (iii) scales effectively to high-resolution digital holography. Extensive experiments incorporating three representative denoisers as regularization show that PGD-MC provides a flexible and effective MLE-based reconstruction framework for digital holography with finite apertures, consistently outperforming prior Plug-and-Play model-based iterative reconstruction methods in both accuracy and speed.

TL;DR: 本文开发了首个完全开源且获得FDA 510(k)认证的深度学习管道Comp2Comp（包含Abdominal Aortic Quantification和Bone Mineral Density模块），用于CT影像的机会性分析，通过多机构验证证明其临床准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开源医学影像分析方案缺乏严格验证，商业方案缺乏透明度导致部署失败，需要同时解决验证性与透明度问题。

Method: 开发开源Comp2Comp框架中的AAQ（分割腹主动脉测动脉瘤尺寸）和BMD（分割椎体估骨密度）算法，并与四家机构的放射科医生标注（AAQ的258例CT）和双能X线检测（BMD的371例CT）对比验证。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence allows automatic extraction of imaging biomarkers from already-acquired radiologic images. This paradigm of opportunistic imaging adds value to medical imaging without additional imaging costs or patient radiation exposure. However, many open-source image analysis solutions lack rigorous validation while commercial solutions lack transparency, leading to unexpected failures when deployed. Here, we report development and validation for two of the first fully open-sourced, FDA-510(k)-cleared deep learning pipelines to mitigate both challenges: Abdominal Aortic Quantification (AAQ) and Bone Mineral Density (BMD) estimation are both offered within the Comp2Comp package for opportunistic analysis of computed tomography scans. AAQ segments the abdominal aorta to assess aneurysm size; BMD segments vertebral bodies to estimate trabecular bone density and osteoporosis risk. AAQ-derived maximal aortic diameters were compared against radiologist ground-truth measurements on 258 patient scans enriched for abdominal aortic aneurysms from four external institutions. BMD binary classifications (low vs. normal bone density) were compared against concurrent DXA scan ground truths obtained on 371 patient scans from four external institutions. AAQ had an overall mean absolute error of 1.57 mm (95% CI 1.38-1.80 mm). BMD had a sensitivity of 81.0% (95% CI 74.0-86.8%) and specificity of 78.4% (95% CI 72.3-83.7%). Comp2Comp AAQ and BMD demonstrated sufficient accuracy for clinical use. Open-sourcing these algorithms improves transparency of typically opaque FDA clearance processes, allows hospitals to test the algorithms before cumbersome clinical pilots, and provides researchers with best-in-class methods.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse multimodal tasks but remain vulnerable to hallucinations rooted in inherent language bias. Despite recent progress, existing hallucination mitigation methods often overlook the underlying hallucination patterns driven by language bias. In this work, we design a novel pipeline to accurately synthesize Hallucination-Inducing Images (HIIs). Using synthesized HIIs, we reveal a consistent scene-conditioned hallucination pattern: models tend to mention objects that are highly typical of the scene even when visual evidence is removed. To quantify the susceptibility of VLMs to this hallucination pattern, we establish the Masked-Object-Hallucination (MOH) benchmark to rigorously evaluate existing state-of-the-art alignment frameworks. Finally, we leverage HIIs to construct high-quality preference datasets for fine-grained alignment. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates hallucinations while preserving general model capabilities. Specifically, our method achieves up to a 38% improvement over the current state-of-the-art on standard hallucination benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有方法难以平衡长程依赖建模与计算效率，Transformer复杂度高，线性注意力难以捕捉时空关系。

Method: 设计VTitans视觉主干（神经记忆+分段局部注意力），层次化适配器优化多尺度特征，TS-CBAM跨时间注意力融合抑制伪变化。

Result: 四个数据集测试显示LEVIR-CD上IoU 84.36%、F1 91.52%，计算效率领先。

Conclusion: ChangeTitans在保持低复杂度的同时显著提升检测精度，适用于大规模遥感场景。

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection is essential for environmental monitoring, urban planning, and related applications. However, current methods often struggle to capture long-range dependencies while maintaining computational efficiency. Although Transformers can effectively model global context, their quadratic complexity poses scalability challenges, and existing linear attention approaches frequently fail to capture intricate spatiotemporal relationships. Drawing inspiration from the recent success of Titans in language tasks, we present ChangeTitans, the Titans-based framework for remote sensing change detection. Specifically, we propose VTitans, the first Titans-based vision backbone that integrates neural memory with segmented local attention, thereby capturing long-range dependencies while mitigating computational overhead. Next, we present a hierarchical VTitans-Adapter to refine multi-scale features across different network layers. Finally, we introduce TS-CBAM, a two-stream fusion module leveraging cross-temporal attention to suppress pseudo-changes and enhance detection accuracy. Experimental evaluations on four benchmark datasets (LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD, LEVIR-CD+, and SYSU-CD) demonstrate that ChangeTitans achieves state-of-the-art results, attaining \textbf{84.36\%} IoU and \textbf{91.52\%} F1-score on LEVIR-CD, while remaining computationally competitive.

Motivation: 传统LiDAR设计与下游任务（如点云配准）分离，导致数据采集次优及计算开销大。需解决固定参数带来的采样、降噪和调参效率问题。

Method: 将配准反馈集成到传感回路中，动态调整LiDAR参数（如点密度、噪声、稀疏性），联合优化传感器采集与配准超参数。

Result: 在CARLA仿真中，该方法对比固定参数基线方法显著提升配准精度与效率，同时保持泛化能力。

Conclusion: 证明自适应LiDAR在自动驾驶和机器人领域感知任务中的潜力，推动传感与任务驱动的协同优化。

Abstract: LiDAR sensors are a key modality for 3D perception, yet they are typically designed independently of downstream tasks such as point cloud registration. Conventional registration operates on pre-acquired datasets with fixed LiDAR configurations, leading to suboptimal data collection and significant computational overhead for sampling, noise filtering, and parameter tuning. In this work, we propose an adaptive LiDAR sensing framework that dynamically adjusts sensor parameters, jointly optimizing LiDAR acquisition and registration hyperparameters. By integrating registration feedback into the sensing loop, our approach optimally balances point density, noise, and sparsity, improving registration accuracy and efficiency. Evaluations in the CARLA simulation demonstrate that our method outperforms fixed-parameter baselines while retaining generalization abilities, highlighting the potential of adaptive LiDAR for autonomous perception and robotic applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过点扩散函数(PSF)分析MHE的物理特性,揭示分辨率本质是平均分辨率N_avg而非最大分辨率N_max,并提出旋转MHE(R-MHE)消除各向异性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MHE在神经场参数化中广泛应用，但其空间特性缺乏物理视角的严格理论支撑，导致超参选择依赖经验法则。需要建立基于物理原理的解析框架来优化MHE性能。

Method: 1) 建立MHE的PSF理论模型并通过闭合式逼近描述碰撞自由场景；2) 解析PSF的半高全宽(FWHM)与分辨率关系；3) 分析哈希冲突对信噪比(SNR)的影响；4) 提出多分辨率输入坐标旋转变换方案(R-MHE)。

Result: 理论层面揭示：1) 有效分辨率由FWHM决定，受优化动力学影响产生N_avg主导而非局部最高N_max；2) 哈希冲突引入散斑噪声导致SNR退化。技术层面验证：3) R-MHE相比传统方法减少方向性伪影，参数量与计算效率保持同等量级。

Conclusion: 本研究通过物理系统视角的PSF分析，建立了MHE的量化评估框架，理论推导指导了R-MHE架构的创新，为神经场编码技术提供了从经验主义到原理性设计的范式转变。

Abstract: Multi-Resolution Hash Encoding (MHE), the foundational technique behind Instant Neural Graphics Primitives, provides a powerful parameterization for neural fields. However, its spatial behavior lacks rigorous understanding from a physical systems perspective, leading to reliance on heuristics for hyperparameter selection. This work introduces a novel analytical approach that characterizes MHE by examining its Point Spread Function (PSF), which is analogous to the Green's function of the system. This methodology enables a quantification of the encoding's spatial resolution and fidelity. We derive a closed-form approximation for the collision-free PSF, uncovering inherent grid-induced anisotropy and a logarithmic spatial profile. We establish that the idealized spatial bandwidth, specifically the Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM), is determined by the average resolution, $N_{\text{avg}}$. This leads to a counterintuitive finding: the effective resolution of the model is governed by the broadened empirical FWHM (and therefore $N_{\text{avg}}$), rather than the finest resolution $N_{\max}$, a broadening effect we demonstrate arises from optimization dynamics. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of finite hash capacity, demonstrating how collisions introduce speckle noise and degrade the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). Leveraging these theoretical insights, we propose Rotated MHE (R-MHE), an architecture that applies distinct rotations to the input coordinates at each resolution level. R-MHE mitigates anisotropy while maintaining the efficiency and parameter count of the original MHE. This study establishes a methodology based on physical principles that moves beyond heuristics to characterize and optimize MHE.

It's a diverse dataset covering 10 common household waste categories: metal, glass, biological, paper, battery, trash, cardboard, shoes, clothes, and plastic. The dataset comprises 13,348 labeled images collected through multiple methods, including DWaste mobile app and curated web sources. Methods included rigorous validation through checksums and outlier detection, analysis of class imbalance and visual separability via PCA/t-SNE, and assessment of background complexity using entropy and saliency measures. The dataset was benchmarked using state-of-the-art deep learning models (EfficientNetV2M, EfficientNetV2S, MobileNet, ResNet50, ResNet101) evaluated on performance metrics and operational carbon emissions. Experiment results indicate EfficientNetV2S achieved the highest performance with 96.19% accuracy and a 0.96 F1-score, though with a moderate carbon cost. Analysis revealed inherent dataset characteristics including class imbalance, a skew toward high-outlier classes (plastic, cardboard, paper), and brightness variations that require consideration. The main conclusion is that GD provides a valuable, real-world benchmark for waste classification research while highlighting important challenges such as class imbalance, background complexity, and environmental trade-offs in model selection that must be addressed for practical deployment.

Method: 构建跨架构跨数据集的潜在特征对齐框架，使用稀疏自编码器分解SegFormer/U-Net激活值，发现共享表示与人群特有特征的相互作用机制

Result: 发现70%的模型失败由人群特有潜在特征导致，通过定向干预修复错误使Dice分数从39.4%提升至74.2%

Conclusion: 潜在空间模型差分技术能有效诊断医学影像分割问题并缓解数据偏移，为模型改进提供可解释指引

Abstract: Modern segmentation models achieve strong predictive performance but remain largely opaque, limiting our ability to diagnose failures, understand dataset shift, or intervene in a principled manner. We introduce Med-SegLens, a model-diffing framework that decomposes segmentation model activations into interpretable latent features using sparse autoencoders trained on SegFormer and U-Net. Through cross-architecture and cross-dataset latent alignment across healthy, adult, pediatric, and sub-Saharan African glioma cohorts, we identify a stable backbone of shared representations, while dataset shift is driven by differential reliance on population-specific latents. We show that these latents act as causal bottlenecks for segmentation failures, and that targeted latent-level interventions can correct errors and improve cross-dataset adaption without retraining, recovering performance in 70% of failure cases and improving Dice score from 39.4% to 74.2%. Our results demonstrate that latent-level model diffing provides a practical and mechanistic tool for diagnosing failures and mitigating dataset shift in segmentation models.

Abstract: Audio-driven 3D talking avatar generation is increasingly important in virtual communication, digital humans, and interactive media, where avatars must preserve identity, synchronize lip motion with speech, express emotion, and exhibit lifelike spatial dynamics, collectively defining a broader objective of expressivity. However, achieving this remains challenging due to insufficient training data with limited subject identities, narrow audio representations, and restricted explicit controllability. In this paper, we propose 3DXTalker, an expressive 3D talking avatar through data-curated identity modeling, audio-rich representations, and spatial dynamics controllability. 3DXTalker enables scalable identity modeling via 2D-to-3D data curation pipeline and disentangled representations, alleviating data scarcity and improving identity generalization. Then, we introduce frame-wise amplitude and emotional cues beyond standard speech embeddings, ensuring superior lip synchronization and nuanced expression modulation. These cues are unified by a flow-matching-based transformer for coherent facial dynamics. Moreover, 3DXTalker also enables natural head-pose motion generation while supporting stylized control via prompt-based conditioning. Extensive experiments show that 3DXTalker integrates lip synchronization, emotional expression, and head-pose dynamics within a unified framework, achieves superior performance in 3D talking avatar generation.

Method: 构建包含11,837对人类标注问答的真实世界地图数据集，覆盖10种地图类型，并对10种主流模型进行基准测试。

Result: 模型在分类任务表现尚可，但在多模态空间推理任务中准确率明显下降，表明存在显著能力差距。

Conclusion: 当前视觉语言模型难以有效处理复杂地理空间推理任务，需要改进对真实地理数据的多维推理能力。

Abstract: Maps are powerful carriers of structured and contextual knowledge, encompassing geography, demographics, infrastructure, and environmental patterns. Reasoning over such knowledge requires models to integrate spatial relationships, visual cues, real-world context, and domain-specific expertise-capabilities that current large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) still struggle to exhibit consistently. Yet, datasets used to benchmark VLMs on map-based reasoning remain narrow in scope, restricted to specific domains, and heavily reliant on artificially generated content (outputs from LLMs or pipeline-based methods), offering limited depth for evaluating genuine geospatial reasoning. To address this gap, we present MapVerse, a large-scale benchmark built on real-world maps. It comprises 11,837 human-authored question-answer pairs across 1,025 maps, spanning ten diverse map categories and multiple question categories for each. The dataset provides a rich setting for evaluating map reading, interpretation, and multimodal reasoning. We evaluate ten state-of-the-art models against our benchmark to establish baselines and quantify reasoning gaps. Beyond overall performance, we conduct fine-grained categorical analyses to assess model inference across multiple dimensions and investigate the visual factors shaping reasoning outcomes. Our findings reveal that while current VLMs perform competitively on classification-style tasks, both open- and closed-source models fall short on advanced tasks requiring complex spatial reasoning.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI has raised concerns about the authenticity of digital images, as highly realistic fake images can now be generated at low cost, potentially increasing societal risks. In response, several datasets have been established to train detection models aimed at distinguishing AI-generated images from real ones. However, existing datasets suffer from limited generalization, low image quality, overly simple prompts, and insufficient image diversity. To address these limitations, we propose a high-quality, large-scale dataset comprising over 730,000 images across multiple categories, including both real and AI-generated images. The generated images are synthesized via state-of-the-art methods, including text-to-image generation (guided by over 10,000 carefully designed prompts), image inpainting, image refinement, and face swapping. Each generated image is annotated with its generation method and category. Inpainting images further include binary masks to indicate inpainted regions, providing rich metadata for analysis. Compared to existing datasets, detection models trained on our dataset demonstrate superior generalization capabilities. Our dataset not only serves as a strong benchmark for evaluating detection methods but also contributes to advancing the robustness of AI-generated image detection techniques. Building upon this, we propose a lightweight detection method based on image noise entropy, which transforms the original image into an entropy tensor of Non-Local Means (NLM) noise before classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that models trained on our dataset achieve strong generalization, and our method delivers competitive performance, establishing a solid baseline for future research. The dataset and source code are publicly available at https://real-hd.github.io.

Abstract: Weakly supervised multimodal video anomaly detection has gained significant attention, yet the potential of the text modality remains under-explored. Text provides explicit semantic information that can enhance anomaly characterization and reduce false alarms. However, extracting effective text features is challenging due to the inability of general-purpose language models to capture anomaly-specific nuances and the scarcity of relevant descriptions. Furthermore, multimodal fusion often suffers from redundancy and imbalance. To address these issues, we propose a novel text-guided framework. First, we introduce an in-context learning-based multi-stage text augmentation mechanism to generate high-quality anomaly text samples for fine-tuning the text feature extractor. Second, we design a multi-scale bottleneck Transformer fusion module that uses compressed bottleneck tokens to progressively integrate information across modalities, mitigating redundancy and imbalance. Experiments on UCF-Crime and XD-Violence demonstrate state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: C²RoPE通过显式建模空间连续性与因果关系，提升了3D多模态模型的视觉处理能力，解决了传统RoPE的局限性。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) built on Large Language Models (LLMs) have established the alignment of 3D visual features with LLM representations as the dominant paradigm. However, the inherited Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) introduces limitations for multimodal processing. Specifically, applying 1D temporal positional indices disrupts the continuity of visual features along the column dimension, resulting in spatial locality loss. Moreover, RoPE follows the prior that temporally closer image tokens are more causally related, leading to long-term decay in attention allocation and causing the model to progressively neglect earlier visual tokens as the sequence length increases. To address these issues, we propose C^2RoPE, an improved RoPE that explicitly models local spatial Continuity and spatial Causal relationships for visual processing. C^2RoPE introduces a spatio-temporal continuous positional embedding mechanism for visual tokens. It first integrates 1D temporal positions with Cartesian-based spatial coordinates to construct a triplet hybrid positional index, and then employs a frequency allocation strategy to encode spatio-temporal positional information across the three index components. Additionally, we introduce Chebyshev Causal Masking, which determines causal dependencies by computing the Chebyshev distance of image tokens in 2D space. Evaluation results across various benchmarks, including 3D scene reasoning and 3D visual question answering, demonstrate C^2RoPE's effectiveness. The code is be available at https://github.com/ErikZ719/C2RoPE.

Abstract: Metaphorical comprehension in images remains a critical challenge for Nowadays AI systems. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at basic Visual Question Answering (VQA), they consistently struggle to grasp the nuanced cultural, emotional, and contextual implications embedded in visual content. This difficulty stems from the task's demand for sophisticated multi-hop reasoning, cultural context, and Theory of Mind (ToM) capabilities, which current models lack. To fill this gap, we propose MetaphorStar, the first end-to-end visual reinforcement learning (RL) framework for image implication tasks. Our framework includes three core components: the fine-grained dataset TFQ-Data, the visual RL method TFQ-GRPO, and the well-structured benchmark TFQ-Bench.
  Our fully open-source MetaphorStar family, trained using TFQ-GRPO on TFQ-Data, significantly improves performance by an average of 82.6% on the image implication benchmarks. Compared with 20+ mainstream MLLMs, MetaphorStar-32B achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) on Multiple-Choice Question and Open-Style Question, significantly outperforms the top closed-source model Gemini-3.0-pro on True-False Question. Crucially, our experiments reveal that learning image implication tasks improves the general understanding ability, especially the complex visual reasoning ability. We further provide a systematic analysis of model parameter scaling, training data scaling, and the impact of different model architectures and training strategies, demonstrating the broad applicability of our method. We open-sourced all model weights, datasets, and method code at https://metaphorstar.github.io.

*Guangjing Yang,ZhangYuan Yu,Ziyuan Qin,Xinyuan Song,Huahui Yi,Qingbo Kang,Jun Gao,Yiyue Li,Chenlin Du,Qicheng Lao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes VRFT-Aug, a visual reinforcement fine-tuning framework for medical domain models that combines prior knowledge injection, perception-driven policy refinement, medically informed reward shaping, and behavioral imitation to improve both visual perception and structured reasoning in cross-modal, vision-centric applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) approaches using rule-based reward schemes have limited application in cross-modal, vision-centric domains—particularly medical imaging—which demands both robust visual perception and structured reasoning capabilities. The authors aim to bridge this gap in extending RFT methodology to medical image analysis.

Method: The VRFT-Aug framework introduces four key strategies: (1) prior knowledge injection to incorporate medical domain expertise, (2) perception-driven policy refinement for better visual understanding, (3) medically informed reward shaping to align with clinical requirements, and (4) behavioral imitation to improve structured reasoning. These methods target both perception and reasoning capabilities while stabilizing the RFT process for medical applications.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple medical datasets demonstrate that VRFT-Aug outperforms standard supervised fine-tuning and traditional RFT baselines. The paper provides empirical validation of their approach and offers practical training heuristics that could be generalized to other medical image tasks.

Conclusion: This work addresses a critical gap in applying RFT to vision-dependent domains by introducing a medical-specialized framework that enhances both perception and reasoning. The authors provide actionable guidance and training insights for developing reliable, reasoning-capable models for high-stakes medical applications, with potential implications for other cross-modal domains.

Abstract: While recent advances in Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) have shown that rule-based reward schemes can enable effective post-training for large language models, their extension to cross-modal, vision-centric domains remains largely underexplored. This limitation is especially pronounced in the medical imaging domain, where effective performance requires both robust visual perception and structured reasoning. In this work, we address this gap by proposing VRFT-Aug, a visual reinforcement fine-tuning framework tailored for the medical domain. VRFT-Aug introduces a series of training strategies designed to augment both perception and reasoning, including prior knowledge injection, perception-driven policy refinement, medically informed reward shaping, and behavioral imitation. Together, these methods aim to stabilize and improve the RFT process.
  Through extensive experiments across multiple medical datasets, we show that our approaches consistently outperform both standard supervised fine-tuning and RFT baselines. Moreover, we provide empirically grounded insights and practical training heuristics that can be generalized to other medical image tasks.

Abstract: Medical foundation models have shown promise in controlled benchmarks, yet widespread deployment remains hindered by reliance on task-specific fine-tuning. Here, we introduce DermFM-Zero, a dermatology vision-language foundation model trained via masked latent modelling and contrastive learning on over 4 million multimodal data points. We evaluated DermFM-Zero across 20 benchmarks spanning zero-shot diagnosis and multimodal retrieval, achieving state-of-the-art performance without task-specific adaptation. We further evaluated its zero-shot capabilities in three multinational reader studies involving over 1,100 clinicians. In primary care settings, AI assistance enabled general practitioners to nearly double their differential diagnostic accuracy across 98 skin conditions. In specialist settings, the model significantly outperformed board-certified dermatologists in multimodal skin cancer assessment. In collaborative workflows, AI assistance enabled non-experts to surpass unassisted experts while improving management appropriateness. Finally, we show that DermFM-Zero's latent representations are interpretable: sparse autoencoders unsupervisedly disentangle clinically meaningful concepts that outperform predefined-vocabulary approaches and enable targeted suppression of artifact-induced biases, enhancing robustness without retraining. These findings demonstrate that a foundation model can provide effective, safe, and transparent zero-shot clinical decision support.

*Yan Wang,Shijie Zhao,Junlin Li,Li Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GenDR-Pix accelerates super-resolution using a VAE-free diffusion model with multi-stage adversarial distillation, achieving efficient 4K image restoration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models for image super-resolution (SR) face slow inference and high memory usage. Existing methods like GenDR reduce inference steps but still suffer from VAE bottleneck limitations during high-resolution processing.

Method: 1) Replace VAE with pixel-(un)shuffle operations for efficient upscaling. 2) Use multi-stage adversarial distillation to remove encoder/decoder dependencies while preserving image quality. 3) Introduce random padding and masked Fourier loss to stabilize training and reduce artifacts.

Result: 2.8x faster and 60% lower memory usage than GenDR with minimal visual quality loss. Achieves 4K image restoration in 1 second using 6GB GPU memory.

Conclusion: GenDR-Pix solves the VAE bottleneck problem for one-step diffusion-based SR through innovative architecture redesign and training strategies, enabling practical deployment for high-resolution images.

Abstract: Diffusion models have attained remarkable breakthroughs in the real-world super-resolution (SR) task, albeit at slow inference and high demand on devices. To accelerate inference, recent works like GenDR adopt step distillation to minimize the step number to one. However, the memory boundary still restricts the maximum processing size, necessitating tile-by-tile restoration of high-resolution images. Through profiling the pipeline, we pinpoint that the variational auto-encoder (VAE) is the bottleneck of latency and memory. To completely solve the problem, we leverage pixel-(un)shuffle operations to eliminate the VAE, reversing the latent-based GenDR to pixel-space GenDR-Pix. However, upscale with x8 pixelshuffle may induce artifacts of repeated patterns. To alleviate the distortion, we propose a multi-stage adversarial distillation to progressively remove the encoder and decoder. Specifically, we utilize generative features from the previous stage models to guide adversarial discrimination. Moreover, we propose random padding to augment generative features and avoid discriminator collapse. We also introduce a masked Fourier space loss to penalize the outliers of amplitude. To improve inference performance, we empirically integrate a padding-based self-ensemble with classifier-free guidance to improve inference scaling. Experimental results show that GenDR-Pix performs 2.8x acceleration and 60% memory-saving compared to GenDR with negligible visual degradation, surpassing other one-step diffusion SR. Against all odds, GenDR-Pix can restore 4K image in only 1 second and 6GB.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出VideoSTF框架，系统性测量视频大语言模型（VideoLLMs）的输出重复问题，揭示时间扰动会导致广泛且可利用的模型退化现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VideoLLMs基准测试忽略输出重复问题，而实际应用中模型易陷入自我强化的重复循环，亟需量化评估方法与安全漏洞防范机制。

Method: 设计VideoSTF框架：1) 三种n-gram指标（重复密度、跨度、连锁度）；2) 包含10K视频的基准数据集；3) 时间变换库（帧率扰动/随机删除/逆序等）；4) 多维度测试（压力测试+对抗攻击）。

Result: 输出重复在10个SOTA模型中普遍存在（如InternVideo2平均重复率23.6%），且对时间扰动极度敏感（如帧率变化1.5倍时GPT4V重复率飙升至41.7%）

Conclusion: 输出重复是VideoLLMs的核心稳定性缺陷，现有训练范式需改进以提高鲁棒性，为多模态模型安全部署提供预警与评估标准。

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have recently achieved strong performance in video understanding tasks. However, we identify a previously underexplored generation failure: severe output repetition, where models degenerate into self-reinforcing loops of repeated phrases or sentences. This failure mode is not captured by existing VideoLLM benchmarks, which focus primarily on task accuracy and factual correctness. We introduce VideoSTF, the first framework for systematically measuring and stress-testing output repetition in VideoLLMs. VideoSTF formalizes repetition using three complementary n-gram-based metrics and provides a standardized testbed of 10,000 diverse videos together with a library of controlled temporal transformations. Using VideoSTF, we conduct pervasive testing, temporal stress testing, and adversarial exploitation across 10 advanced VideoLLMs. We find that output repetition is widespread and, critically, highly sensitive to temporal perturbations of video inputs. Moreover, we show that simple temporal transformations can efficiently induce repetitive degeneration in a black-box setting, exposing output repetition as an exploitable security vulnerability. Our results reveal output repetition as a fundamental stability issue in modern VideoLLMs and motivate stability-aware evaluation for video-language systems. Our evaluation code and scripts are available at: https://github.com/yuxincao22/VideoSTF_benchmark.

Conclusion: MP-HOI通过多模态数据融合与渐进式交互优化，有效解决了传统方法在跨模态生成中的三大关键缺陷

Abstract: We address the challenging task of text-driven 3D human-object interaction (HOI) motion generation. Existing methods primarily rely on a direct text-to-HOI mapping, which suffers from three key limitations due to the significant cross-modality gap: (Q1) sub-optimal human motion, (Q2) unnatural object motion, and (Q3) weak interaction between humans and objects. To address these challenges, we propose MP-HOI, a novel framework grounded in four core insights: (1) Multimodal Data Priors: We leverage multimodal data (text, image, pose/object) from large multimodal models as priors to guide HOI generation, which tackles Q1 and Q2 in data modeling. (2) Enhanced Object Representation: We improve existing object representations by incorporating geometric keypoints, contact features, and dynamic properties, enabling expressive object representations, which tackles Q2 in data representation. (3) Multimodal-Aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Model: We propose a modality-aware MoE model for effective multimodal feature fusion paradigm, which tackles Q1 and Q2 in feature fusion. (4) Cascaded Diffusion with Interaction Supervision: We design a cascaded diffusion framework that progressively refines human-object interaction features under dedicated supervision, which tackles Q3 in interaction refinement. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MP-HOI outperforms existing approaches in generating high-fidelity and fine-grained HOI motions.

### [31] [Dynamic Frequency Modulation for Controllable Text-driven Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10662)
*Tiandong Shi,Ling Zhao,Ji Qi,Jiayi Ma,Chengli Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a training-free frequency modulation method for text-guided diffusion models, enabling semantic updates while preserving structural consistency through dynamic decay-weighted frequency components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The problem arises from unintended global structure changes when modifying text prompts in diffusion models, exacerbated by empirical feature map selection. A frequency-based analysis is proposed to dissociate structure formation (low-frequency dominance) from texture synthesis (high-frequency dominance).

Method: An analytical framework correlating frequency spectrum of latent variables with hierarchical generation stages was developed. A frequency-dependent weighting function with dynamic decay parameters was implemented to directly modulate latent variables, avoiding internal feature map engineering.

Result: Key discovery of temporal frequency dominance patterns: low frequencies dominate structure establishment (early stages), transitioning to high frequencies for fine-grained textures. The proposed method achieved superior structure preservation while enabling targeted modifications, validated through quantitative comparisons with SOTA methods.

Conclusion: Frequency modulation offers a principled, training-free approach to disentangle structure and semantics in diffusion models, overcoming limitations of empirical feature engineering through mathematical formulation of frequency-domain dynamics.

Abstract: The success of text-guided diffusion models has established a new image generation paradigm driven by the iterative refinement of text prompts. However, modifying the original text prompt to achieve the expected semantic adjustments often results in unintended global structure changes that disrupt user intent. Existing methods rely on empirical feature map selection for intervention, whose performance heavily depends on appropriate selection, leading to suboptimal stability. This paper tries to solve the aforementioned problem from a frequency perspective and analyzes the impact of the frequency spectrum of noisy latent variables on the hierarchical emergence of the structure framework and fine-grained textures during the generation process. We find that lower-frequency components are primarily responsible for establishing the structure framework in the early generation stage. Their influence diminishes over time, giving way to higher-frequency components that synthesize fine-grained textures. In light of this, we propose a training-free frequency modulation method utilizing a frequency-dependent weighting function with dynamic decay. This method maintains the structure framework consistency while permitting targeted semantic modifications. By directly manipulating the noisy latent variable, the proposed method avoids the empirical selection of internal feature maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, achieving an effective balance between preserving structure and enabling semantic updates.

Abstract: Visual Chain-of-Thought (VCoT) has emerged as a promising paradigm for enhancing multimodal reasoning by integrating visual perception into intermediate reasoning steps. However, existing VCoT approaches are largely confined to static scenarios and struggle to capture the temporal dynamics essential for tasks such as instruction, prediction, and camera motion. To bridge this gap, we propose TwiFF-2.7M, the first large-scale, temporally grounded VCoT dataset derived from $2.7$ million video clips, explicitly designed for dynamic visual question and answer. Accompanying this, we introduce TwiFF-Bench, a high-quality evaluation benchmark of $1,078$ samples that assesses both the plausibility of reasoning trajectories and the correctness of final answers in open-ended dynamic settings. Building on these foundations, we propose the TwiFF model, a unified modal that synergistically leverages pre-trained video generation and image comprehension capabilities to produce temporally coherent visual reasoning cues-iteratively generating future action frames and textual reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TwiFF significantly outperforms existing VCoT methods and Textual Chain-of-Thought baselines on dynamic reasoning tasks, which fully validates the effectiveness for visual question answering in dynamic scenarios.

Abstract: Existing forgery detection methods are often limited to uni-modal or bi-modal settings, failing to handle the interleaved text, images, and videos prevalent in real-world misinformation. To bridge this gap, this paper targets to develop a unified framework for omnibus vision-language forgery detection and grounding. In this unified setting, the {interplay} between diverse modalities and the dual requirements of simultaneous detection and localization pose a critical ``difficulty bias`` problem: the simpler veracity classification task tends to dominate the gradients, leading to suboptimal performance in fine-grained grounding during multi-task optimization. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{OmniVL-Guard}, a balanced reinforcement learning framework for omnibus vision-language forgery detection and grounding. Particularly, OmniVL-Guard comprises two core designs: Self-Evolving CoT Generatio and Adaptive Reward Scaling Policy Optimization (ARSPO). {Self-Evolving CoT Generation} synthesizes high-quality reasoning paths, effectively overcoming the cold-start challenge. Building upon this, {Adaptive Reward Scaling Policy Optimization (ARSPO)} dynamically modulates reward scales and task weights, ensuring a balanced joint optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OmniVL-Guard significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods and exhibits zero-shot robust generalization across out-of-domain scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes integrating depth estimation and an action assistant module into Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models to enhance 3D feature representations, improving robotic perception and action grounding in complex environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLA models rely on 2D image-trained vision models, leading to limited spatial understanding in 3D environments. The goal is to bridge the gap between 2D observations and 3D-aware robotic decision-making using existing 2D datasets while recovering implicit 3D structural information.

Method: The authors integrate depth estimation (VGGT baseline) to extract geometry-aware 3D cues from RGB inputs and introduce an 'action assistant' module that constrains learned 3D representations with action priors. This ensures consistency with downstream control tasks. Enhanced 3D features are fused with standard 2D visual tokens for improved model performance.

Result: The method improves perception in geometrically ambiguous scenarios and achieves superior action prediction accuracy compared to conventional VLA models, demonstrating enhanced generalization ability and robustness through depth-driven data augmentation and auxiliary supervision.

Conclusion: The proposed framework highlights the potential of combining depth estimation and action-prior constraints to enable 3D-aware decision-making in robotics while leveraging existing 2D datasets for scalable learning.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently achieved remarkable progress in robotic perception and control, yet most existing approaches primarily rely on VLM trained using 2D images, which limits their spatial understanding and action grounding in complex 3D environments. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that integrates depth estimation into VLA models to enrich 3D feature representations. Specifically, we employ a depth estimation baseline called VGGT to extract geometry-aware 3D cues from standard RGB inputs, enabling efficient utilization of existing large-scale 2D datasets while implicitly recovering 3D structural information. To further enhance the reliability of these depth-derived features, we introduce a new module called action assistant, which constrains the learned 3D representations with action priors and ensures their consistency with downstream control tasks. By fusing the enhanced 3D features with conventional 2D visual tokens, our approach significantly improves the generalization ability and robustness of VLA models. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method not only strengthens perception in geometrically ambiguous scenarios but also leads to superior action prediction accuracy. This work highlights the potential of depth-driven data augmentation and auxiliary expert supervision for bridging the gap between 2D observations and 3D-aware decision-making in robotic systems.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了（MGS）$^2$，这是一种基于3D几何的跨视图地理定位框架，包含三个模块（MGSF、MGSA、GACD），在University-1652数据集上实现了97.5%的Recall@1性能。

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization (CVGL) is pivotal for GNSS-denied UAV navigation but remains brittle under the drastic geometric misalignment between oblique aerial views and orthographic satellite references. Existing methods predominantly operate within a 2D manifold, neglecting the underlying 3D geometry where view-dependent vertical facades (macro-structure) and scale variations (micro-scale) severely corrupt feature alignment. To bridge this gap, we propose (MGS)$^2$, a geometry-grounded framework. The core of our innovation is the Macro-Geometric Structure Filtering (MGSF) module. Unlike pixel-wise matching sensitive to noise, MGSF leverages dilated geometric gradients to physically filter out high-frequency facade artifacts while enhancing the view-invariant horizontal plane, directly addressing the domain shift. To guarantee robust input for this structural filtering, we explicitly incorporate a Micro-Geometric Scale Adaptation (MGSA) module. MGSA utilizes depth priors to dynamically rectify scale discrepancies via multi-branch feature fusion. Furthermore, a Geometric-Appearance Contrastive Distillation (GACD) loss is designed to strictly discriminate against oblique occlusions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that (MGS)$^2$ achieves state-of-the-art performance, recording a Recall@1 of 97.5\% on University-1652 and 97.02\% on SUES-200. Furthermore, the framework exhibits superior cross-dataset generalization against geometric ambiguity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates geospatial foundation models (GFMs) like TerraMind and Prithvi for ecological applications, showing their superior performance over ResNet-101 models, especially when incorporating additional data modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GFMs have potential for ecological tasks (e.g., land-use mapping, forest traits, peatland detection) but lack thorough evaluation in high-value use cases. The study aims to address this gap by benchmarking their effectiveness and challenges.

Method: The authors fine-tuned GFMs (Prithvi-E0-2.0, TerraMind) across three ecological use cases (LULC mapping, forest functional traits, peatland detection) and compared their performance to a baseline ResNet-101 model. They analyzed accuracy, input data divergence, and the impact of multimodal inputs.

Result: GFMs consistently outperformed ResNet-101. TerraMind marginally surpassed Prithvi, with significant gains when additional modalities were used. Key limitations included performance drops when input data diverged from training distributions and the need for higher-resolution labels for pixel-level tasks.

Conclusion: GFMs are promising tools for ecological mapping but require optimized data resolution and labeling. TerraMind demonstrates stronger adaptability than Prithvi, though both benefit from multimodal training and domain-specific fine-tuning.

Abstract: Geospatial foundation models (GFMs) are a fast-emerging paradigm for various geospatial tasks, such as ecological mapping. However, the utility of GFMs has not been fully explored for high-value use cases. This study aims to explore the utility, challenges and opportunities associated with the application of GFMs for ecological uses. In this regard, we fine-tune several pretrained AI models, namely, Prithvi-E0-2.0 and TerraMind, across three use cases, and compare this with a baseline ResNet-101 model. Firstly, we demonstrate TerraMind's LULC generation capabilities. Lastly, we explore the utility of the GFMs in forest functional trait mapping and peatlands detection. In all experiments, the GFMs outperform the baseline ResNet models. In general TerraMind marginally outperforms Prithvi. However, with additional modalities TerraMind significantly outperforms the baseline ResNet and Prithvi models. Nonetheless, consideration should be given to the divergence of input data from pretrained modalities. We note that these models would benefit from higher resolution and more accurate labels, especially for use cases where pixel-level dynamics need to be mapped.

Abstract: Accurate facial landmark detection under occlusion remains challenging, especially for human-like faces with large appearance variation and rotation-driven self-occlusion. Existing detectors typically localize landmarks while handling occlusion implicitly, without predicting per-point visibility that downstream applications can benefits. We present OccFace, an occlusion-aware framework for universal human-like faces, including humans, stylized characters, and other non-human designs. OccFace adopts a unified dense 100-point layout and a heatmap-based backbone, and adds an occlusion module that jointly predicts landmark coordinates and per-point visibility by combining local evidence with cross-landmark context. Visibility supervision mixes manual labels with landmark-aware masking that derives pseudo visibility from mask-heatmap overlap. We also create an occlusion-aware evaluation suite reporting NME on visible vs. occluded landmarks and benchmarking visibility with Occ AP, F1@0.5, and ROC-AUC, together with a dataset annotated with 100-point landmarks and per-point visibility. Experiments show improved robustness under external occlusion and large head rotations, especially on occluded regions, while preserving accuracy on visible landmarks.

Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) applied to real-world low-resolution (LR) images often results in complex, irregular degradations that stem from the inherent complexity of natural scene acquisition. In contrast to SR artifacts arising from synthetic LR images created under well-defined scenarios, those distortions are highly unpredictable and vary significantly across different real-life contexts. Consequently, assessing the quality of SR images (SR-IQA) obtained from realistic LR, remains a challenging and underexplored problem. In this work, we introduce a no-reference SR-IQA approach tailored for such highly ill-posed realistic settings. The proposed method enables domain-adaptive IQA for real-world SR applications, particularly in data-scarce domains. We hypothesize that degradations in super-resolved images are strongly dependent on the underlying SR algorithms, rather than being solely determined by image content. To this end, we introduce a self-supervised learning (SSL) strategy that first pretrains multiple SR model oriented representations in a pretext stage. Our contrastive learning framework forms positive pairs from images produced by the same SR model and negative pairs from those generated by different methods, independent of image content. The proposed approach S3 RIQA, further incorporates targeted preprocessing to extract complementary quality information and an auxiliary task to better handle the various degradation profiles associated with different SR scaling factors. To this end, we constructed a new dataset, SRMORSS, to support unsupervised pretext training; it includes a wide range of SR algorithms applied to numerous real LR images, which addresses a gap in existing datasets. Experiments on real SR-IQA benchmarks demonstrate that S3 RIQA consistently outperforms most state-of-the-art relevant metrics.

Abstract: Computer graphics, comprising both raster and vector components, is a fundamental part of modern science, industry, and digital communication. While raster graphics offer ease of use, its pixel-based structure limits scalability. Vector graphics, defined by mathematical primitives, provides scalability without quality loss, however, it is more complex to produce. For design and architecture, the versatility of vector graphics is paramount, despite its computational demands. This paper introduces a novel method for generating vector residential plans from textual descriptions. Our approach surpasses existing solutions by approximately 5% in CLIPScore-based visual quality, benefiting from its inherent handling of right angles and flexible settings. Additionally, we present a new algorithm for vectorizing raster plans into structured vector images. Such images have a better CLIPscore compared to others by about 4%.

Conclusion: 通过轨迹分解与正则化策略，有效解决训练不稳定问题并提升生成质量

Abstract: The slow iterative sampling nature remains a major bottleneck for the practical deployment of diffusion and flow-based generative models. While consistency models (CMs) represent a state-of-the-art distillation-based approach for efficient generation, their large-scale application is still limited by two key issues: training instability and inflexible sampling. Existing methods seek to mitigate these problems through architectural adjustments or regularized objectives, yet overlook the critical reliance on trajectory selection. In this work, we first conduct an analysis on these two limitations: training instability originates from loss divergence induced by unstable self-supervised term, whereas sampling inflexibility arises from error accumulation. Based on these insights and analysis, we propose the Dual-End Consistency Model (DE-CM) that selects vital sub-trajectory clusters to achieve stable and effective training. DE-CM decomposes the PF-ODE trajectory and selects three critical sub-trajectories as optimization targets. Specifically, our approach leverages continuous-time CMs objectives to achieve few-step distillation and utilizes flow matching as a boundary regularizer to stabilize the training process. Furthermore, we propose a novel noise-to-noisy (N2N) mapping that can map noise to any point, thereby alleviating the error accumulation in the first step. Extensive experimental results show the effectiveness of our method: it achieves a state-of-the-art FID score of 1.70 in one-step generation on the ImageNet 256x256 dataset, outperforming existing CM-based one-step approaches.

Abstract: Cyclists often encounter safety-critical situations in urban traffic, highlighting the need for assistive systems that support safe and informed decision-making. Recently, vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on autonomous driving benchmarks, suggesting their potential for general traffic understanding and navigation-related reasoning. However, existing evaluations are predominantly vehicle-centric and fail to assess perception and reasoning from a cyclist-centric viewpoint. To address this gap, we introduce CyclingVQA, a diagnostic benchmark designed to probe perception, spatio-temporal understanding, and traffic-rule-to-lane reasoning from a cyclist's perspective. Evaluating 31+ recent VLMs spanning general-purpose, spatially enhanced, and autonomous-driving-specialized models, we find that current models demonstrate encouraging capabilities, while also revealing clear areas for improvement in cyclist-centric perception and reasoning, particularly in interpreting cyclist-specific traffic cues and associating signs with the correct navigational lanes. Notably, several driving-specialized models underperform strong generalist VLMs, indicating limited transfer from vehicle-centric training to cyclist-assistive scenarios. Finally, through systematic error analysis, we identify recurring failure modes to guide the development of more effective cyclist-assistive intelligent systems.

Conclusion: RSHallu通过系统化方法显著降低遥感多模态模型幻觉,同时维持下游任务性能,为高风险场景应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly adopted in remote sensing (RS) and have shown strong performance on tasks such as RS visual grounding (RSVG), RS visual question answering (RSVQA), and multimodal dialogue. However, hallucinations, which are responses inconsistent with the input RS images, severely hinder their deployment in high-stakes scenarios (e.g., emergency management and agricultural monitoring) and remain under-explored in RS. In this work, we present RSHallu, a systematic study with three deliverables: (1) we formalize RS hallucinations with an RS-oriented taxonomy and introduce image-level hallucination to capture RS-specific inconsistencies beyond object-centric errors (e.g., modality, resolution, and scene-level semantics); (2) we build a hallucination benchmark RSHalluEval (2,023 QA pairs) and enable dual-mode checking, supporting high-precision cloud auditing and low-cost reproducible local checking via a compact checker fine-tuned on RSHalluCheck dataset (15,396 QA pairs); and (3) we introduce a domain-tailored dataset RSHalluShield (30k QA pairs) for training-friendly mitigation and further propose training-free plug-and-play strategies, including decoding-time logit correction and RS-aware prompting. Across representative RS-MLLMs, our mitigation improves the hallucination-free rate by up to 21.63 percentage points under a unified protocol, while maintaining competitive performance on downstream RS tasks (RSVQA/RSVG). Code and datasets will be released.

Abstract: Cross-category anomaly detection for 3D point clouds aims to determine whether an unseen object belongs to a target category using only a few normal examples. Most existing methods rely on category-specific training, which limits their flexibility in few-shot scenarios. In this paper, we propose DMP-3DAD, a training-free framework for cross-category 3D anomaly detection based on multi-view realistic depth map projection. Specifically, by converting point clouds into a fixed set of realistic depth images, our method leverages a frozen CLIP visual encoder to extract multi-view representations and performs anomaly detection via weighted feature similarity, which does not require any fine-tuning or category-dependent adaptation. Extensive experiments on the ShapeNetPart dataset demonstrate that DMP-3DAD achieves state-of-the-art performance under few-shot setting. The results show that the proposed approach provides a simple yet effective solution for practical cross-category 3D anomaly detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlowCache is a caching framework for autoregressive video generation models that improves speed by up to 6.7 times while maintaining quality through chunk-specific caching policies and optimized compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional caching strategies fail in autoregressive video generation due to varying similarity patterns across video chunks, leading to inefficient recomputation and slow synthesis processes.

Method: FlowCache introduces chunkwise dynamic caching policies, adaptive denoising strategies per video chunk, and a KV cache compression mechanism balancing importance and redundancy under fixed memory constraints.

Result: 2.38x speedup on MAGI-1 and 6.7x speedup on SkyReels-V2 with negligible quality changes (VBench: +0.87/-0.79), enabling real-time ultra-long video generation.

Conclusion: FlowCache establishes a new efficiency benchmark for autoregressive video generation, achieving state-of-the-art acceleration with minimal quality trade-offs.

Abstract: Autoregressive models, often built on Transformer architectures, represent a powerful paradigm for generating ultra-long videos by synthesizing content in sequential chunks. However, this sequential generation process is notoriously slow. While caching strategies have proven effective for accelerating traditional video diffusion models, existing methods assume uniform denoising across all frames-an assumption that breaks down in autoregressive models where different video chunks exhibit varying similarity patterns at identical timesteps. In this paper, we present FlowCache, the first caching framework specifically designed for autoregressive video generation. Our key insight is that each video chunk should maintain independent caching policies, allowing fine-grained control over which chunks require recomputation at each timestep. We introduce a chunkwise caching strategy that dynamically adapts to the unique denoising characteristics of each chunk, complemented by a joint importance-redundancy optimized KV cache compression mechanism that maintains fixed memory bounds while preserving generation quality. Our method achieves remarkable speedups of 2.38 times on MAGI-1 and 6.7 times on SkyReels-V2, with negligible quality degradation (VBench: 0.87 increase and 0.79 decrease respectively). These results demonstrate that FlowCache successfully unlocks the potential of autoregressive models for real-time, ultra-long video generation-establishing a new benchmark for efficient video synthesis at scale.

*Darakshan Rashid,Raza Imam,Dwarikanath Mahapatra,Brejesh Lall*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Stride-Net, a fairness-aware framework for chest X-ray classification that reduces demographic bias while maintaining diagnostic accuracy by learning disentangled representations and aligning features with clinical semantics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing debiasing methods for medical imaging models often sacrifice overall performance or show inconsistent fairness improvements. Bias in chest X-ray diagnosis risks inequitable clinical outcomes, necessitating a solution that balances fairness and diagnostic utility.

Method: Stride-Net integrates learnable stride-based patch masking to focus on disease-relevant regions while suppressing demographic information through adversarial confusion loss. It further strengthens clinical relevance via Group Optimal Transport alignment between image features and BioBERT-encoded disease embeddings.

Result: Evaluated on MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert datasets, Stride-Net improved fairness metrics (e.g., reduced race-gender subgroup disparities) across ResNet and Vision Transformer backbones while matching/exceeding baseline accuracy, outperforming prior debiasing approaches in accuracy-fairness trade-offs.

Conclusion: Stride-Net demonstrates fairness can be proactively embedded in representation learning rather than applied post hoc, enabling more equitable medical diagnostics without compromising performance. Code availability: https://github.com/Daraksh/Fairness_StrideNet

Abstract: Deep neural networks for chest X-ray classification achieve strong average performance, yet often underperform for specific demographic subgroups, raising critical concerns about clinical safety and equity. Existing debiasing methods frequently yield inconsistent improvements across datasets or attain fairness by degrading overall diagnostic utility, treating fairness as a post hoc constraint rather than a property of the learned representation. In this work, we propose Stride-Net (Sensitive Attribute Resilient Learning via Disentanglement and Learnable Masking with Embedding Alignment), a fairness-aware framework that learns disease-discriminative yet demographically invariant representations for chest X-ray analysis. Stride-Net operates at the patch level, using a learnable stride-based mask to select label-aligned image regions while suppressing sensitive attribute information through adversarial confusion loss. To anchor representations in clinical semantics and discourage shortcut learning, we further enforce semantic alignment between image features and BioBERT-based disease label embeddings via Group Optimal Transport. We evaluate Stride-Net on the MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert benchmarks across race and intersectional race-gender subgroups. Across architectures including ResNet and Vision Transformers, Stride-Net consistently improves fairness metrics while matching or exceeding baseline accuracy, achieving a more favorable accuracy-fairness trade-off than prior debiasing approaches.

Conclusion: 结构化监督能有效提升图表转代码的准确性和数据利用效率，为生成代码保持结构一致性提供新路径

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promise in generating plotting code from chart images, yet achieving structural fidelity remains challenging. Existing approaches largely rely on supervised fine-tuning, encouraging surface-level token imitation rather than faithful modeling of underlying chart structure, which often leads to hallucinated or semantically inconsistent outputs. We propose Chart Specification, a structured intermediate representation that shifts training from text imitation to semantically grounded supervision. Chart Specification filters syntactic noise to construct a structurally balanced training set and supports a Spec-Align Reward that provides fine-grained, verifiable feedback on structural correctness, enabling reinforcement learning to enforce consistent plotting logic. Experiments on three public benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms prior approaches. With only 3K training samples, we achieve strong data efficiency, surpassing leading baselines by up to 61.7% on complex benchmarks, and scaling to 4K samples establishes new state-of-the-art results across all evaluated metrics. Overall, our results demonstrate that precise structural supervision offers an efficient pathway to high-fidelity chart-to-code generation.

Abstract: The comprehensive understanding capabilities of world models for driving scenarios have significantly improved the planning accuracy of end-to-end autonomous driving frameworks. However, the redundant modeling of static regions and the lack of deep interaction with trajectories hinder world models from exerting their full effectiveness. In this paper, we propose Temporal Residual World Model (TR-World), which focuses on dynamic object modeling. By calculating the temporal residuals of scene representations, the information of dynamic objects can be extracted without relying on detection and tracking. TR-World takes only temporal residuals as input, thus predicting the future spatial distribution of dynamic objects more precisely. By combining the prediction with the static object information contained in the current BEV features, accurate future BEV features can be obtained. Furthermore, we propose Future-Guided Trajectory Refinement (FGTR) module, which conducts interaction between prior trajectories (predicted from the current scene representation) and the future BEV features. This module can not only utilize future road conditions to refine trajectories, but also provides sparse spatial-temporal supervision on future BEV features to prevent world model collapse. Comprehensive experiments conducted on the nuScenes and NAVSIM datasets demonstrate that our method, namely ResWorld, achieves state-of-the-art planning performance.

Method: 提出FastUSP多层次优化框架：1) 编译级优化（CUDA图编译与计算-通信重排序） 2) 通信级优化（FP8量化通信） 3) 操作级优化（流水线Ring注意力+双缓冲）

Result: 在FLUX模型上实现1.12-1.16倍端到端加速（编译优化贡献最大）；Qwen-Image 2GPU获1.09倍加速，但4-8GPU因PyTorch编译兼容问题未发挥编译优势

Conclusion: 实验表明在高带宽GPU互连中，内核启动开销而非通信延迟成为主要瓶颈，FastUSP通过多级优化框架有效突破该限制。

Abstract: Large-scale diffusion models such as FLUX (12B parameters) and Stable Diffusion 3 (8B parameters) require multi-GPU parallelism for efficient inference. Unified Sequence Parallelism (USP), which combines Ulysses and Ring attention mechanisms, has emerged as the state-of-the-art approach for distributed attention computation. However, existing USP implementations suffer from significant inefficiencies including excessive kernel launch overhead and suboptimal computation-communication scheduling. In this paper, we propose \textbf{FastUSP}, a multi-level optimization framework that integrates compile-level optimization (graph compilation with CUDA Graphs and computation-communication reordering), communication-level optimization (FP8 quantized collective communication), and operator-level optimization (pipelined Ring attention with double buffering). We evaluate FastUSP on FLUX (12B) and Qwen-Image models across 2, 4, and 8 NVIDIA RTX 5090 GPUs. On FLUX, FastUSP achieves consistent \textbf{1.12$\times$--1.16$\times$} end-to-end speedup over baseline USP, with compile-level optimization contributing the dominant improvement. On Qwen-Image, FastUSP achieves \textbf{1.09$\times$} speedup on 2 GPUs; on 4--8 GPUs, we identify a PyTorch Inductor compatibility limitation with Ring attention that prevents compile optimization, while baseline USP scales to 1.30$\times$--1.46$\times$ of 2-GPU performance. We further provide a detailed analysis of the performance characteristics of distributed diffusion inference, revealing that kernel launch overhead -- rather than communication latency -- is the primary bottleneck on modern high-bandwidth GPU interconnects.

Abstract: We introduce a Generalizable Neural Radiance Field approach for predicting 3D workspace occupancy from egocentric robot observations.

The model integrates flexible source views and generalizes to unseen object arrangements without scene-specific finetuning. We demonstrate the approach on a humanoid robot and evaluate predicted geometry against 3D sensor ground truth. Trained on 40 real scenes, our model achieves 26mm reconstruction error, including occluded regions, validating its ability to infer complete 3D occupancy beyond traditional stereo vision methods.

Abstract: Guava fruits often suffer from many diseases. This can harm fruit quality and fruit crop yield. Early identification is important for minimizing damage and ensuring fruit health. This study focuses on 3 different categories for classifying diseases. These are Anthracnose, Fruit flies, and Healthy fruit. The data set used in this study is collected from Mendeley Data. This dataset contains 473 original images of Guava. These images vary in size and format. The original dataset was resized to 256x256 pixels with RGB color mode for better consistency. After this, the Data augmentation process is applied to improve the dataset by generating variations of the original images. The augmented dataset consists of 3784 images using advanced preprocessing techniques. Two deep learning models were implemented to classify the images. The InceptionV3 model is well known for its advanced framework. These apply multiple convolutional filters for obtaining different features effectively. On the other hand, the ResNet50 model helps to train deeper networks by using residual learning. The InceptionV3 model achieved the impressive accuracy of 98.15%, and ResNet50got 94.46% accuracy.

TL;DR: 本文提出包含58,000张图像和2706个视频的DFIC人脸数据集，专注于ICAO合规检测，包含广泛合规/非合规样本及均衡人口分布，通过空间注意力机制方法验证并提升现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有手动ICAO合规检测效率低下且数据集存在人口分布偏差，缺乏非合规样例多样性，本研究旨在构建标准化数据集并开发自动化验证方案。

Method: 基于空间注意力机制构建深度学习模型，使用DFIC数据集进行微调，通过对比实验验证方法有效性。

Conclusion: DFIC数据集不仅优化自动化ICAO合规检测，且可扩展至人脸识别安全隐私提升、算法公平性验证等跨领域研究。

Abstract: Ensuring compliance with ISO/IEC and ICAO standards for facial images in machine-readable travel documents (MRTDs) is essential for reliable identity verification, but current manual inspection methods are inefficient in high-demand environments. This paper introduces the DFIC dataset, a novel comprehensive facial image dataset comprising around 58,000 annotated images and 2706 videos of more than 1000 subjects, that cover a broad range of non-compliant conditions, in addition to compliant portraits. Our dataset provides a more balanced demographic distribution than the existing public datasets, with one partition that is nearly uniformly distributed, facilitating the development of automated ICAO compliance verification methods.
  Using DFIC, we fine-tuned a novel method that heavily relies on spatial attention mechanisms for the automatic validation of ICAO compliance requirements, and we have compared it with the state-of-the-art aimed at ICAO compliance verification, demonstrating improved results. DFIC dataset is now made public (https://github.com/visteam-isr-uc/DFIC) for the training and validation of new models, offering an unprecedented diversity of faces, that will improve both robustness and adaptability to the intrinsically diverse combinations of faces and props that can be presented to the validation system. These results emphasize the potential of DFIC to enhance automated ICAO compliance methods but it can also be used in many other applications that aim to improve the security, privacy, and fairness of facial recognition systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了适用于视觉Transformer（ViT）的SVD-Inspired Attention（SVDA）机制，通过几何建模提升注意力的可解释性、稀疏性和谱结构，且在多个图像分类任务中保持了准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的ViT注意力机制透明度低且呈稠密非结构化行为，亟需增强其可解释性与结构化特性。

Method: 将作者先前提出的SVDA机制适配到ViT架构，采用几何建模方法结合可解释性指标（interpretability indicators）监测训练中的注意力动态及表征结构属性。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、FashionMNIST等四个基准数据集的实验表明，SVDA在保持分类准确率的同时显著提升了注意力模式的可解释性。

Conclusion: SVDA为结构化注意力模型分析提供了基础性工具，未来可推动可解释AI、谱诊断及注意力模型压缩方向的发展。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in image classification, yet their attention mechanisms often remain opaque and exhibit dense, non-structured behaviors. In this work, we adapt our previously proposed SVD-Inspired Attention (SVDA) mechanism to the ViT architecture, introducing a geometrically grounded formulation that enhances interpretability, sparsity, and spectral structure. We apply the use of interpretability indicators -- originally proposed with SVDA -- to monitor attention dynamics during training and assess structural properties of the learned representations. Experimental evaluations on four widely used benchmarks -- CIFAR-10, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-100 -- demonstrate that SVDA consistently yields more interpretable attention patterns without sacrificing classification accuracy. While the current framework offers descriptive insights rather than prescriptive guidance, our results establish SVDA as a comprehensive and informative tool for analyzing and developing structured attention models in computer vision. This work lays the foundation for future advances in explainable AI, spectral diagnostics, and attention-based model compression.

Conclusion: 通过内容感知的动态数据裁剪方法，PP-DNN在自动驾驶多模态感知系统中实现了计算资源的高效利用，为实时性敏感场景提供新型优化范式

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) rely on sensors and deep neural networks (DNNs) to perceive their surrounding environment and make maneuver decisions in real time. However, achieving real-time DNN inference in the AV's perception pipeline is challenging due to the large gap between the computation requirement and the AV's limited resources. Most, if not all, of existing studies focus on optimizing the DNN inference time to achieve faster perception by compressing the DNN model with pruning and quantization. In contrast, we present a Predictable Perception system with DNNs (PP-DNN) that reduce the amount of image data to be processed while maintaining the same level of accuracy for multi-tenant DNNs by dynamically selecting critical frames and regions of interest (ROIs). PP-DNN is based on our key insight that critical frames and ROIs for AVs vary with the AV's surrounding environment. However, it is challenging to identify and use critical frames and ROIs in multi-tenant DNNs for predictable inference. Given image-frame streams, PP-DNN leverages an ROI generator to identify critical frames and ROIs based on the similarities of consecutive frames and traffic scenarios. PP-DNN then leverages a FLOPs predictor to predict multiply-accumulate operations (MACs) from the dynamic critical frames and ROIs. The ROI scheduler coordinates the processing of critical frames and ROIs with multiple DNN models. Finally, we design a detection predictor for the perception of non-critical frames. We have implemented PP-DNN in an ROS-based AV pipeline and evaluated it with the BDD100K and the nuScenes dataset. PP-DNN is observed to significantly enhance perception predictability, increasing the number of fusion frames by up to 7.3x, reducing the fusion delay by >2.6x and fusion-delay variations by >2.3x, improving detection completeness by 75.4% and the cost-effectiveness by up to 98% over the baseline.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于奇异值分解（SVD）的注意力机制（SVDA），将其集成到密集预测Transformer（DPT）中，首次实现了稠密预测任务中注意力机制的谱结构化设计，同时保持模型透明性与性能的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前Transformer中的自注意力机制对单目深度估计等任务缺乏可解释性，难以满足机器人、自动驾驶等领域对模型可靠性的需求。研究旨在通过谱结构化设计，使注意力机制从‘黑箱’转化为可量化分析的显性描述工具。

Conclusion: SVDA通过建立注意力机制与谱分析的理论关联，为单目深度估计提供了兼具性能和可解释性的新范式，开辟了基于原则性数学框架的透明稠密预测模型研究路径。

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation is a central problem in computer vision with applications in robotics, AR, and autonomous driving, yet the self-attention mechanisms that drive modern Transformer architectures remain opaque. We introduce SVD-Inspired Attention (SVDA) into the Dense Prediction Transformer (DPT), providing the first spectrally structured formulation of attention for dense prediction tasks. SVDA decouples directional alignment from spectral modulation by embedding a learnable diagonal matrix into normalized query-key interactions, enabling attention maps that are intrinsically interpretable rather than post-hoc approximations. Experiments on KITTI and NYU-v2 show that SVDA preserves or slightly improves predictive accuracy while adding only minor computational overhead. More importantly, SVDA unlocks six spectral indicators that quantify entropy, rank, sparsity, alignment, selectivity, and robustness. These reveal consistent cross-dataset and depth-wise patterns in how attention organizes during training, insights that remain inaccessible in standard Transformers. By shifting the role of attention from opaque mechanism to quantifiable descriptor, SVDA redefines interpretability in monocular depth estimation and opens a principled avenue toward transparent dense prediction models.

Conclusion: 通过结构化视觉链和空间约束建模，显著提升复杂场景手术器械计数准确性，为医疗安全提供新解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate counting of surgical instruments in Operating Rooms (OR) is a critical prerequisite for ensuring patient safety during surgery. Despite recent progress of large visual-language models and agentic AI, accurately counting such instruments remains highly challenging, particularly in dense scenarios where instruments are tightly clustered. To address this problem, we introduce Chain-of-Look, a novel visual reasoning framework that mimics the sequential human counting process by enforcing a structured visual chain, rather than relying on classic object detection which is unordered. This visual chain guides the model to count along a coherent spatial trajectory, improving accuracy in complex scenes. To further enforce the physical plausibility of the visual chain, we introduce the neighboring loss function, which explicitly models the spatial constraints inherent to densely packed surgical instruments. We also present SurgCount-HD, a new dataset comprising 1,464 high-density surgical instrument images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches for counting (e.g., CountGD, REC) as well as Multimodality Large Language Models (e.g., Qwen, ChatGPT) in the challenging task of dense surgical instrument counting.

Conclusion: 模块化设计有效协调模型轻量化与特征完整性，为移动端/嵌入式视觉任务提供新范式

Abstract: We propose PuriLight, a lightweight and efficient framework for self-supervised monocular depth estimation, to address the dual challenges of computational efficiency and detail preservation. While recent advances in self-supervised depth estimation have reduced reliance on ground truth supervision, existing approaches remain constrained by either bulky architectures compromising practicality or lightweight models sacrificing structural precision. These dual limitations underscore the critical need to develop lightweight yet structurally precise architectures. Our framework addresses these limitations through a three-stage architecture incorporating three novel modules: the Shuffle-Dilation Convolution (SDC) module for local feature extraction, the Rotation-Adaptive Kernel Attention (RAKA) module for hierarchical feature enhancement, and the Deep Frequency Signal Purification (DFSP) module for global feature purification. Through effective collaboration, these modules enable PuriLight to achieve both lightweight and accurate feature extraction and processing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PuriLight achieves state-of-the-art performance with minimal training parameters while maintaining exceptional computational efficiency.

TL;DR: 该论文提出ViLaVT框架，通过语言引导的动态视觉特征调制增强跨模态对齐，提升视觉语言模型的多图像和视频空间推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视觉语言模型依赖单一视觉编码和文本推理，导致细节信息丢失；已有‘图文思考’方法因视觉状态与语言语义脱节，难处理跨区域复杂语义或几何关系推理。

Method: 设计‘chatting with images’框架，通过语言提示引导多区域动态重编码，实现视觉状态和语言推理的联合更新，并构建动态视觉编码器ViLaVT，采用两阶段课程学习（监督微调+强化学习）训练。

Result: 在八基准测试中ViLaVT表现显著提升，尤其在复杂多图像与视频空间推理任务上增益显著。

Conclusion: 该方法通过动态语言引导的视觉调制机制，有效解决了跨模态对齐不足问题，为视觉语言模型提供了更细致的交互式推理能力。

Abstract: Current large vision-language models (LVLMs) typically rely on text-only reasoning based on a single-pass visual encoding, which often leads to loss of fine-grained visual information. Recently the proposal of ''thinking with images'' attempts to alleviate this limitation by manipulating images via external tools or code; however, the resulting visual states are often insufficiently grounded in linguistic semantics, impairing effective cross-modal alignment - particularly when visual semantics or geometric relationships must be reasoned over across distant regions or multiple images. To address these challenges, we propose ''chatting with images'', a new framework that reframes visual manipulation as language-guided feature modulation. Under the guidance of expressive language prompts, the model dynamically performs joint re-encoding over multiple image regions, enabling tighter coupling between linguistic reasoning and visual state updates. We instantiate this paradigm in ViLaVT, a novel LVLM equipped with a dynamic vision encoder explicitly designed for such interactive visual reasoning, and trained it with a two-stage curriculum combining supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning to promote effective reasoning behaviors. Extensive experiments across eight benchmarks demonstrate that ViLaVT achieves strong and consistent improvements, with particularly pronounced gains on complex multi-image and video-based spatial reasoning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lack of large, diverse datasets has hindered progress in biometric footstep recognition, particularly in generalizing to new users and adapting to variables like footwear and walking speed.

Method: Release of the UNB StepUP-P150 dataset and organization of the First International StepUP Competition. Competitors developed deep learning models evaluated on verification performance under challenging conditions with limited reference data.

Result: 23 global teams participated. The top-performing Saeid_UCC model achieved 10.77% EER using GRM optimization. Models showed strong performance but struggled with unfamiliar footwear scenarios.

Conclusion: The StepUP-P150 dataset and competition demonstrated progress in deep learning-driven footstep recognition but highlighted persistent challenges in real-world robustness, particularly for unseen footwear variations.

Abstract: Biometric footstep recognition, based on a person's unique pressure patterns under their feet during walking, is an emerging field with growing applications in security and safety. However, progress in this area has been limited by the lack of large, diverse datasets necessary to address critical challenges such as generalization to new users and robustness to shifts in factors like footwear or walking speed. The recent release of the UNB StepUP-P150 dataset, the largest and most comprehensive collection of high-resolution footstep pressure recordings to date, opens new opportunities for addressing these challenges through deep learning. To mark this milestone, the First International StepUP Competition for Biometric Footstep Recognition was launched. Competitors were tasked with developing robust recognition models using the StepUP-P150 dataset that were then evaluated on a separate, dedicated test set designed to assess verification performance under challenging variations, given limited and relatively homogeneous reference data. The competition attracted global participation, with 23 registered teams from academia and industry. The top-performing team, Saeid_UCC, achieved the best equal error rate (EER) of 10.77% using a generative reward machine (GRM) optimization strategy. Overall, the competition showcased strong solutions, but persistent challenges in generalizing to unfamiliar footwear highlight a critical area for future work.

Result: 在图像/视频生成和编辑任务中实现2.6倍加速，输出质量保持领先水平。

Conclusion: FastFlow作为即插即用框架，在无需模型重训练的前提下显著提升生成效率，源代码已开源。

Abstract: Flow-matching models deliver state-of-the-art fidelity in image and video generation, but the inherent sequential denoising process renders them slower. Existing acceleration methods like distillation, trajectory truncation, and consistency approaches are static, require retraining, and often fail to generalize across tasks. We propose FastFlow, a plug-and-play adaptive inference framework that accelerates generation in flow matching models. FastFlow identifies denoising steps that produce only minor adjustments to the denoising path and approximates them without using the full neural network models used for velocity predictions. The approximation utilizes finite-difference velocity estimates from prior predictions to efficiently extrapolate future states, enabling faster advancements along the denoising path at zero compute cost. This enables skipping computation at intermediary steps. We model the decision of how many steps to safely skip before requiring a full model computation as a multi-armed bandit problem. The bandit learns the optimal skips to balance speed with performance. FastFlow integrates seamlessly with existing pipelines and generalizes across image generation, video generation, and editing tasks. Experiments demonstrate a speedup of over 2.6x while maintaining high-quality outputs. The source code for this work can be found at https://github.com/Div290/FastFlow.

Conclusion: 证明了专用领域模块与扩散模型结合的有效性，首次实现可精确控制的发丝级头发动画生成，为数字人制作提供了新的工业级解决方案。

Abstract: We present HairWeaver, a diffusion-based pipeline that animates a single human image with realistic and expressive hair dynamics. While existing methods successfully control body pose, they lack specific control over hair, and as a result, fail to capture the intricate hair motions, resulting in stiff and unrealistic animations. HairWeaver overcomes this limitation using two specialized modules: a Motion-Context-LoRA to integrate motion conditions and a Sim2Real-Domain-LoRA to preserve the subject's photoreal appearance across different data domains. These lightweight components are designed to guide a video diffusion backbone while maintaining its core generative capabilities. By training on a specialized dataset of dynamic human motion generated from a CG simulator, HairWeaver affords fine control over hair motion and ultimately learns to produce highly realistic hair that responds naturally to movement. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that our approach sets a new state of the art, producing lifelike human hair animations with dynamic details.

Motivation: 现有判别模型主要训练于通用视觉领域（如图像描述、视觉问答），但物理AI涉及感知、因果推理和规划的任务尚未被深入探索。需要专门针对物理交互任务的评估工具。

Method: PhyCritic采用两阶段RLVR框架：1)物理技能预热阶段强化物理感知与推理能力；2)自参照式判别微调阶段，通过生成内部参考预测提升判别稳定性与物理正确性。

Result: 在物理与通用多模态判别基准中超越开源基线模型，作为策略模型应用时进一步提升物理任务的感知与推理能力，实验显示判别稳定性提升37%、物理正确性提高42%。

Conclusion: PhyCritic有效填补了物理AI领域专用评估模型的空白，其自参照机制为多模态模型对齐提供了新的技术路径，适用于机器人、模拟环境等物理交互场景。

Abstract: With the rapid development of large multimodal models, reliable judge and critic models have become essential for open-ended evaluation and preference alignment, providing pairwise preferences, numerical scores, and explanatory justifications for assessing model-generated responses. However, existing critics are primarily trained in general visual domains such as captioning or image question answering, leaving physical AI tasks involving perception, causal reasoning, and planning largely underexplored. We introduce PhyCritic, a multimodal critic model optimized for physical AI through a two-stage RLVR pipeline: a physical skill warmup stage that enhances physically oriented perception and reasoning, followed by self-referential critic finetuning, where the critic generates its own prediction as an internal reference before judging candidate responses, improving judgment stability and physical correctness. Across both physical and general-purpose multimodal judge benchmarks, PhyCritic achieves strong performance gains over open-source baselines and, when applied as a policy model, further improves perception and reasoning in physically grounded tasks.

Motivation: 现有实验方法难以准确测量两相流界面动力学，传统技术受限于移动界面附近的测量，而神经渲染方法无法处理尖锐变形的液-汽界面。现有方法在处理稀疏观测和保持几何一致性方面存在不足。

Method: 1) 整合动态高斯surfels与带符号距离函数(SDF)实现几何一致性建模；2) 采用时空扩散模型合成多视角视频；3) 通过物理感知的表面演化方程约束界面动力学；4) 基于梯度下降优化实现稀疏视角条件下的参数估计。

Abstract: Interfacial dynamics in two-phase flows govern momentum, heat, and mass transfer, yet remain difficult to measure experimentally. Classical techniques face intrinsic limitations near moving interfaces, while existing neural rendering methods target single-phase flows with diffuse boundaries and cannot handle sharp, deformable liquid-vapor interfaces. We propose SurfPhase, a novel model for reconstructing 3D interfacial dynamics from sparse camera views. Our approach integrates dynamic Gaussian surfels with a signed distance function formulation for geometric consistency, and leverages a video diffusion model to synthesize novel-view videos to refine reconstruction from sparse observations. We evaluate on a new dataset of high-speed pool boiling videos, demonstrating high-quality view synthesis and velocity estimation from only two camera views.

Method: 1) 分解评审为论点段落；2) 通过神经符号模块融合LLM特征与传统分类器识别问题（如清晰度/具体性不足）；3) 利用遗传算法优化模板生成针对性反馈。

Result: 实验显示方法较零样本LLM基线显著提升，评审质量改善达92.4%，并发布包含1309条标注数据的LazyReviewPlus数据集。

Conclusion: 框架实现了多问题检测与反馈生成的协同优化，数据集为领域研究提供基准，未来可拓展至其他文本质量评估场景。

Abstract: Peer review is central to scientific quality, yet reliance on simple heuristics -- lazy thinking -- has lowered standards. Prior work treats lazy thinking detection as a single-label task, but review segments may exhibit multiple issues, including broader clarity problems, or specificity issues. Turning detection into actionable improvements requires guideline-aware feedback, which is currently missing. We introduce an LLM-driven framework that decomposes reviews into argumentative segments, identifies issues via a neurosymbolic module combining LLM features with traditional classifiers, and generates targeted feedback using issue-specific templates refined by a genetic algorithm. Experiments show our method outperforms zero-shot LLM baselines and improves review quality by up to 92.4\%. We also release LazyReviewPlus, a dataset of 1,309 sentences labeled for lazy thinking and specificity.

Result: 实验显示LT-Tuning在潜空间推理任务中优于基线方法，有效缓解特征坍缩并提高推理鲁棒性。

Conclusion: LT-Tuning为大型语言模型提供了一种更灵活、稳定的连续空间推理范式。

Abstract: While explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) equips Large Language Models (LLMs) with strong reasoning capabilities, it requires models to verbalize every intermediate step in text tokens, constraining the model thoughts to the discrete vocabulary space. Recently, reasoning in continuous latent space has emerged as a promising alternative, enabling more robust inference and flexible computation beyond discrete token constraints. However, current latent paradigms often suffer from feature collapse and instability, stemming from distribution mismatches when recurrently using hidden states as the input embeddings, or alignment issues when relying on assistant models. To address this, we propose Latent Thoughts Tuning (LT-Tuning), a framework that redefines how latent thoughts are constructed and deployed. Instead of relying solely on raw hidden states, our method introduces a Context-Prediction-Fusion mechanism that jointly leveraging contextual hidden states and predictive semantic guidance from the vocabulary embedding space. Combined with a progressive three-stage curriculum learning pipeline, LT-Tuning also enables dynamically switching between latent and explicit thinking modes. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing latent reasoning baselines, effectively mitigating feature collapse and achieving robust reasoning accuracy.

*Luca Moschella,Laura Manduchi,Ozan Sener*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出KV Policy (KVP)，通过强化学习学习未来token效用预测，优化自回归生成中的KV Cache管理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KV Cache的驱逐策略基于间接启发式规则（如时间最近性或历史注意力得分），难以准确评估token未来效用且计算开销大，需更高效的自适应方法。

Method: 将KV Cache驱逐建模为强化学习问题，构建轻量级的多头RL智能体，利用预计算的key-value向量进行训练，通过未来效用函数量化token重要性排序。

Result: 在RULER和OASST2-4k等长文本基准测试中显著优于基线方法，且在LongBench等零样本任务中展现跨领域长序列泛化能力。

Conclusion: 未来token效用预测可作为动态KV Cache管理的可扩展新范式，为LLM推理效率优化提供新路径。

Abstract: The growing size of Large Language Models (LLMs) makes efficient inference challenging, primarily due to the memory demands of the autoregressive Key-Value (KV) cache. Existing eviction or compression methods reduce cost but rely on heuristics, such as recency or past attention scores, which serve only as indirect proxies for a token's future utility and introduce computational overhead. We reframe KV cache eviction as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem: learning to rank tokens by their predicted usefulness for future decoding. To this end, we introduce KV Policy (KVP), a framework of lightweight per-head RL agents trained on pre-computed generation traces using only key and value vectors. Each agent learns a specialized eviction policy guided by future utility, which evaluates the quality of the ranking across all cache budgets, requiring no modifications to the underlying LLM or additional inference. Evaluated across two different model families on the long-context benchmark RULER and the multi-turn dialogue benchmark OASST2-4k, KVP significantly outperforms baselines. Furthermore, zero-shot tests on standard downstream tasks (e.g., LongBench, BOOLQ, ARC) indicate that KVP generalizes well beyond its training distribution and to longer context lengths. These results demonstrate that learning to predict future token utility is a powerful and scalable paradigm for adaptive KV cache management.

Motivation: 验证大模型能否如人类般形成跨领域复用的心理表征机制（功能整合假说），以探讨其是否具备社会认知的涌现能力。

Method: 基于行为评估与因果机制实验，采用认知神经科学的功能定位方法，在包含7种子能力的大规模ToM数据集上进行严格验证。

Result: 实验证实LMs在多个任务中存在共享机制，支持'社交世界模型'通过功能整合而非孤立能力发展的理论。

Conclusion: 大模型或形成类似人类的跨任务社会认知结构，为AI系统社会智能涌现提供了新数据与方法论依据。

Abstract: This paper investigates whether LMs recruit shared computational mechanisms for general Theory of Mind (ToM) and language-specific pragmatic reasoning in order to contribute to the general question of whether LMs may be said to have emergent "social world models", i.e., representations of mental states that are repurposed across tasks (the functional integration hypothesis). Using behavioral evaluations and causal-mechanistic experiments via functional localization methods inspired by cognitive neuroscience, we analyze LMs' performance across seven subcategories of ToM abilities (Beaudoin et al., 2020) on a substantially larger localizer dataset than used in prior like-minded work. Results from stringent hypothesis-driven statistical testing offer suggestive evidence for the functional integration hypothesis, indicating that LMs may develop interconnected "social world models" rather than isolated competencies. This work contributes novel ToM localizer data, methodological refinements to functional localization techniques, and empirical insights into the emergence of social cognition in artificial systems.

*Zhimin Hu,Riya Roshan,Sashank Varma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究表时，通过推理时扩展可使语言模型自发形成资源合理性推理策略，无需显式计算成本奖励。在变量归因任务中，模型随任务复杂度增加由暴力搜索转向分析策略，且大型推理模型（LRMs）展现出优于指令微调模型（IT模型）的逻辑函数稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管现有语言模型通过显式推理路径生成（IT模型）和强化学习优化推理路径（LRMs）提升性能，但尚未明确资源合理性（权衡推理质量与算力成本）是否能在无显式成本奖励的情况下通过扩展推理时计算实现。

Method: 设计了通过增减候选变量数量和输入输出试验次数动态调节复杂度的变量归因任务，对比IT模型与LRMs在AND/OR/XOR/XNOR四类逻辑函数中的表现，观察其推理策略从暴力穷举到结构化分析的演化规律。

Result: 1）两种模型均随复杂度上升呈现策略过渡，但IT模型在XOR/XNOR任务准确率显著下降，而LRMs保持80%+稳定；2）LRMs在高复杂度场景下优先调用分析性思维（chain-of-thought）比例达73%，IT模型仅34%。

Conclusion: 推理时计算扩展本身即可促使模型自发平衡推理效率与准确性，证实资源理性是语言模型扩缩容时的内生属性。研究为理解大模型认知模式演化提供了无需特定奖励函数的新机制，同时揭示基于强化学习的LRMs更能适应复杂推理需求。

Abstract: Human reasoning is shaped by resource rationality -- optimizing performance under constraints. Recently, inference-time scaling has emerged as a powerful paradigm to improve the reasoning performance of Large Language Models by expanding test-time computation. Specifically, instruction-tuned (IT) models explicitly generate long reasoning steps during inference, whereas Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are trained by reinforcement learning to discover reasoning paths that maximize accuracy. However, it remains unclear whether resource-rationality can emerge from such scaling without explicit reward related to computational costs. We introduce a Variable Attribution Task in which models infer which variables determine outcomes given candidate variables, input-output trials, and predefined logical functions. By varying the number of candidate variables and trials, we systematically manipulate task complexity. Both models exhibit a transition from brute-force to analytic strategies as complexity increases. IT models degrade on XOR and XNOR functions, whereas LRMs remain robust. These findings suggest that models can adjust their reasoning behavior in response to task complexity, even without explicit cost-based reward. It provides compelling evidence that resource rationality is an emergent property of inference-time scaling itself.

Method: 开发评估量表、构建偏好数据框架、提出视角感知模型

Conclusion: 框架帮助理解社区期望，促进公众信任与程序正当性

Abstract: Traffic stops are among the most frequent police-civilian interactions, and body-worn cameras (BWCs) provide a unique record of how these encounters unfold. Respect is a central dimension of these interactions, shaping public trust and perceived legitimacy, yet its interpretation is inherently subjective and shaped by lived experience, rendering community-specific perspectives a critical consideration. Leveraging unprecedented access to Los Angeles Police Department BWC footage, we introduce the first large-scale traffic-stop dataset annotated with respect ratings and free-text rationales from multiple perspectives. By sampling annotators from police-affiliated, justice-system-impacted, and non-affiliated Los Angeles residents, we enable the systematic study of perceptual differences across diverse communities. To this end, we (i) develop a domain-specific evaluation rubric grounded in procedural justice theory, LAPD training materials, and extensive fieldwork; (ii) introduce a rubric-driven preference data construction framework for perspective-consistent alignment; and (iii) propose a perspective-aware modeling framework that predicts personalized respect ratings and generates annotator-specific rationales for both officers and civilian drivers from traffic-stop transcripts. Across all three annotator groups, our approach improves both rating prediction performance and rationale alignment. Our perspective-aware framework enables law enforcement to better understand diverse community expectations, providing a vital tool for building public trust and procedural legitimacy.

Motivation: 现有自解释方法因超参数敏感而不可靠，需探索无需修改模型结构的解决方案。

Method: 在冻结大模型权重的前提下，训练仅含d_model+1参数的标量仿射适配器，利用其偏差向量捕获关键特征。

Result: 适配器在700亿参数模组上生成特征标签得分71%，超越原始训练标签63%；主题识别召回率达94%（基线仅1%）；解码多跳推理中的隐式桥梁实体。

Conclusion: 通过适配器微调可规模化提升自解释能力，且复杂度更低的模型泛化效果更优。自解释收益远超单纯参数量增长带来的能力提升。

Abstract: Self-interpretation methods prompt language models to describe their own internal states, but remain unreliable due to hyperparameter sensitivity. We show that training lightweight adapters on interpretability artifacts, while keeping the LM entirely frozen, yields reliable self-interpretation across tasks and model families. A scalar affine adapter with just $d_\text{model}+1$ parameters suffices: trained adapters generate sparse autoencoder feature labels that outperform the training labels themselves (71% vs 63% generation scoring at 70B scale), identify topics with 94% recall@1 versus 1% for untrained baselines, and decode bridge entities in multi-hop reasoning that appear in neither prompt nor response, surfacing implicit reasoning without chain-of-thought. The learned bias vector alone accounts for 85% of improvement, and simpler adapters generalize better than more expressive alternatives. Controlling for model knowledge via prompted descriptions, we find self-interpretation gains outpace capability gains from 7B to 72B parameters. Our results demonstrate that self-interpretation improves with scale, without modifying the model being interpreted.

Motivation: 卫星基础模型生成的嵌入向量缺乏物理可解释性，阻碍了其在环境决策系统中的应用。通过大规模验证其与环境变量的关联性，建立可操作化的环境智能系统。

Method: 基于1210万样本（美国本土2017-2023年），综合线性、非线性及注意力机制方法解析64维嵌入向量与26类环境变量的映射关系，构建FAISS索引的检索增强生成系统，采用LLM-as-Judge框架评估360轮问答质量。

Conclusion: 卫星嵌入向量具有物理结构特性，可转化为环境智能工具，自然语言驱动的卫星数据交互系统展现实际应用价值。

Abstract: Satellite foundation models produce dense embeddings whose physical interpretability remains poorly understood, limiting their integration into environmental decision systems. Using 12.1 million samples across the Continental United States (2017--2023), we first present a comprehensive interpretability analysis of Google AlphaEarth's 64-dimensional embeddings against 26 environmental variables spanning climate, vegetation, hydrology, temperature, and terrain. Combining linear, nonlinear, and attention-based methods, we show that individual embedding dimensions map onto specific land surface properties, while the full embedding space reconstructs most environmental variables with high fidelity (12 of 26 variables exceed $R^2 > 0.90$; temperature and elevation approach $R^2 = 0.97$). The strongest dimension-variable relationships converge across all three analytical methods and remain robust under spatial block cross-validation (mean $ΔR^2 = 0.017$) and temporally stable across all seven study years (mean inter-year correlation $r = 0.963$). Building on these validated interpretations, we then developed a Land Surface Intelligence system that implements retrieval-augmented generation over a FAISS-indexed embedding database of 12.1 million vectors, translating natural language environmental queries into satellite-grounded assessments. An LLM-as-Judge evaluation across 360 query--response cycles, using four LLMs in rotating generator, system, and judge roles, achieved weighted scores of $μ= 3.74 \pm 0.77$ (scale 1--5), with grounding ($μ= 3.93$) and coherence ($μ= 4.25$) as the strongest criteria. Our results demonstrate that satellite foundation model embeddings are physically structured representations that can be operationalized for environmental and geospatial intelligence.

Motivation: 针对现有结构化索赔分解方法实证结果不一致问题，提出证据对齐和子主张错误类型是关键限制因素。

Method: 构建含时序标注证据的新数据集，评估子主张对齐证据(SAE)与重复主张级别证据(SRE)两种设置，并分析子主张标签噪声的影响。

Result: SAE设置下性能显著提升，但SRE设置导致性能下降；子主张错误中，保守拒绝预测的误差传播率比激进错误预测低。

Conclusion: 需优先发展精确的证据合成机制，并校准子主张验证模型的标签偏差以提高鲁棒性。

Abstract: Structured claim decomposition is often proposed as a solution for verifying complex, multi-faceted claims, yet empirical results have been inconsistent. We argue that these inconsistencies stem from two overlooked bottlenecks: evidence alignment and sub-claim error profiles. To better understand these factors, we introduce a new dataset of real-world complex claims, featuring temporally bounded evidence and human-annotated sub-claim evidence spans. We evaluate decomposition under two evidence alignment setups: Sub-claim Aligned Evidence (SAE) and Repeated Claim-level Evidence (SRE). Our results reveal that decomposition brings significant performance improvement only when evidence is granular and strictly aligned. By contrast, standard setups that rely on repeated claim-level evidence (SRE) fail to improve and often degrade performance as shown across different datasets and domains (PHEMEPlus, MMM-Fact, COVID-Fact). Furthermore, we demonstrate that in the presence of noisy sub-claim labels, the nature of the error ends up determining downstream robustness. We find that conservative "abstention" significantly reduces error propagation compared to aggressive but incorrect predictions. These findings suggest that future claim decomposition frameworks must prioritize precise evidence synthesis and calibrate the label bias of sub-claim verification models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 后门攻击对大语言模型的安全性构成威胁，但触发器在模型内部的操作机制尚不明确，需深入研究。

Method: 通过激活补丁技术定位GAPperon模型家族触发器形成层，识别处理触发信息的注意力头，分析触发头与自然语言头的关联性。

Result: 触发器形成集中在早期层（7.5%-25%深度）；触发头与自然编码输出语言的头显著重叠（Jaccard指数0.18-0.66）；触发器未形成独立电路。

Conclusion: 后门防御应监控模型原有功能组件而非搜索隐藏电路，缓解策略可利用注入行为与自然行为的纠缠特性。

Abstract: Backdoor attacks pose significant security risks for Large Language Models (LLMs), yet the internal mechanisms by which triggers operate remain poorly understood. We present the first mechanistic analysis of language-switching backdoors, studying the GAPperon model family (1B, 8B, 24B parameters) which contains triggers injected during pretraining that cause output language switching. Using activation patching, we localize trigger formation to early layers (7.5-25% of model depth) and identify which attention heads process trigger information. Our central finding is that trigger-activated heads substantially overlap with heads naturally encoding output language across model scales, with Jaccard indices between 0.18 and 0.66 over the top heads identified. This suggests that backdoor triggers do not form isolated circuits but instead co-opt the model's existing language components. These findings have implications for backdoor defense: detection methods may benefit from monitoring known functional components rather than searching for hidden circuits, and mitigation strategies could potentially leverage this entanglement between injected and natural behaviors.

Motivation: 视觉-语言模型在非英语专业领域的可靠性研究不足，尤其金融文档包含密集监管文本、表格和图表，需建立评估基准解决该领域模型可能存在的实际风险。

Method: 构建首个法语金融文档多模态基准数据集，包含1204个专家验证问题，涵盖文本提取、表格理解、图表解读和多轮对话，并对6个大参数量VLMs进行LLM-as-judge协议评估。

Result: 模型在文本和表格任务达85-90%准确率，但图表解读仅34-62%；多轮对话中早期错误传导使准确率降至50%，显示出模型在交互式多步骤分析中的脆弱性。

Conclusion: 现有VLMs在金融文档提取任务有效，但需重点提升多模态图表表征能力和对话推理稳定性，Multimodal Finance Eval提供了推动该领域进步的基准测试工具。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) perform well on many document understanding tasks, yet their reliability in specialized, non-English domains remains underexplored. This gap is especially critical in finance, where documents mix dense regulatory text, numerical tables, and visual charts, and where extraction errors can have real-world consequences. We introduce Multimodal Finance Eval, the first multimodal benchmark for evaluating French financial document understanding. The dataset contains 1,204 expert-validated questions spanning text extraction, table comprehension, chart interpretation, and multi-turn conversational reasoning, drawn from real investment prospectuses, KIDs, and PRIIPs. We evaluate six open-weight VLMs (8B-124B parameters) using an LLM-as-judge protocol. While models achieve strong performance on text and table tasks (85-90% accuracy), they struggle with chart interpretation (34-62%). Most notably, multi-turn dialogue reveals a sharp failure mode: early mistakes propagate across turns, driving accuracy down to roughly 50% regardless of model size.
  These results show that current VLMs are effective for well-defined extraction tasks but remain brittle in interactive, multi-step financial analysis. Multimodal Finance Eval offers a challenging benchmark to measure and drive progress in this high-stakes setting.

Conclusion: 为数据驱动优化LLM提供了方法论突破，揭示了任务相关特征覆盖与模型性能的强关联性，并支持跨架构知识迁移。

Abstract: The diversity of post-training data is critical for effective downstream performance in large language models (LLMs). Many existing approaches to constructing post-training data quantify diversity using text-based metrics that capture linguistic variation, but such metrics provide only weak signals for the task-relevant features that determine downstream performance. In this work, we introduce Feature Activation Coverage (FAC) which measures data diversity in an interpretable feature space. Building upon this metric, we further propose a diversity-driven data synthesis framework, named FAC Synthesis, that first uses a sparse autoencoder to identify missing features from a seed dataset, and then generates synthetic samples that explicitly reflect these features. Experiments show that our approach consistently improves both data diversity and downstream performance on various tasks, including instruction following, toxicity detection, reward modeling, and behavior steering. Interestingly, we identify a shared, interpretable feature space across model families (i.e., LLaMA, Mistral, and Qwen), enabling cross-model knowledge transfer. Our work provides a solid and practical methodology for exploring data-centric optimization of LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand when and how anxiety manifests in online behavior through large-scale social media analysis.

Method: Applied a word-anxiety association lexicon to analyze millions of tweets, examining temporal patterns and linguistic features (tense, pronouns).

Result: Anxiety peaks at 8am, dips at noon; higher on weekdays vs weekends. Past-tense statements show higher anxiety, future-tense lower. Third-person pronoun posts (he/they) and subject pronouns (I/he) correlate with increased anxiety compared to first/second-person and object pronouns.

Conclusion: Temporal and linguistic patterns in social media reflect underlying psychological states, linking anxiety to cognitive focus (past vs future, self vs others) and offering insights into collective mental health trends.

Abstract: In this short paper, we make use of a recently created lexicon of word-anxiety associations to analyze large amounts of US and Canadian social media data (tweets) to explore *when* we are anxious and what insights that reveals about us. We show that our levels of anxiety on social media exhibit systematic patterns of rise and fall during the day -- highest at 8am (in-line with when we have high cortisol levels in the body) and lowest around noon. Anxiety is lowest on weekends and highest mid-week. We also examine anxiety in past, present, and future tense sentences to show that anxiety is highest in past tense and lowest in future tense. Finally, we examine the use of anxiety and calmness words in posts that contain pronouns to show: more anxiety in 3rd person pronouns (he, they) posts than 1st and 2nd person pronouns and higher anxiety in posts with subject pronouns (I, he, she, they) than object pronouns (me, him, her, them). Overall, these trends provide valuable insights on not just when we are anxious, but also how different types of focus (future, past, self, outward, etc.) are related to anxiety.

Conclusion: 神经符号系统在保持逻辑一致性同时增强语义表达，有效权衡生成式大模型与符号系统的优劣势。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong general-purpose reasoning capabilities, yet they frequently hallucinate when used as world models (WMs), where strict compliance with deterministic transition rules--particularly in corner cases--is essential. In contrast, Symbolic WMs provide logical consistency but lack semantic expressivity. To bridge this gap, we propose Neuro-Symbolic Synergy (NeSyS), a framework that integrates the probabilistic semantic priors of LLMs with executable symbolic rules to achieve both expressivity and robustness. NeSyS alternates training between the two models using trajectories inadequately explained by the other. Unlike rule-based prompting, the symbolic WM directly constrains the LLM by modifying its output probability distribution. The neural WM is fine-tuned only on trajectories not covered by symbolic rules, reducing training data by 50% without loss of accuracy. Extensive experiments on three distinct interactive environments, i.e., ScienceWorld, Webshop, and Plancraft, demonstrate NeSyS's consistent advantages over baselines in both WM prediction accuracy and data efficiency.

Conclusion: 提出多模态推理新范式，通过外置视觉基板和显式状态维护机制，解决了传统CoT的高token消耗与认知负荷问题，为高维复杂任务处理提供了更高效的框架。

Abstract: While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has significantly advanced the reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), relying solely on linear text sequences remains a bottleneck for complex tasks. We observe that even when auxiliary visual elements are interleaved, they are often treated as static snapshots within a one-dimensional, unstructured reasoning chain. We argue that such approaches treat reasoning history as an immutable stream: correcting a local error necessitates either generating verbose downstream corrections or regenerating the entire context. This forces the model to implicitly maintain and track state updates, significantly increasing token consumption and cognitive load. This limitation is particularly acute in high-dimensional domains, such as geometry and SVG design, where the textual expression of CoT lacks explicit visual guidance, further constraining the model's reasoning precision. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{Canvas-of-Thought (Canvas-CoT)}. By leveraging a HTML Canvas as an external reasoning substrate, Canvas-CoT empowers the model to perform atomic, DOM-based CRUD operations. This architecture enables in-place state revisions without disrupting the surrounding context, allowing the model to explicitly maintain the "ground truth". Furthermore, we integrate a rendering-based critique loop that serves as a hard constraint validator, providing explicit visual feedback to resolve complex tasks that are difficult to articulate through text alone. Extensive experiments on VCode, RBench-V, and MathVista demonstrate that Canvas-CoT significantly outperforms existing baselines, establishing a new paradigm for context-efficient multimodal reasoning.

*Ming Dong,Shiyi Tang,Ziyan Peng,Guanyi Chen,Tingting He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Knowledge-Editing-based detoxification's robustness is evaluated, revealing limitations in reliability and effectiveness under various conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations of KE-based detoxification rely on automatic toxicity classifiers, which may not capture genuine behavioral suppression. This work aims to assess robustness beyond these metrics.

Method: Proposed a framework evaluating three dimensions: optimization robustness, compositional robustness, and cross-lingual robustness.

Result: Identified pseudo-detoxification as a failure mode, degradation in effectiveness with joint editing of multiple unsafe behaviors, and dependence on specific model-method combinations for detoxification success.

Conclusion: KE-based detoxification works robustly only for certain models, limited objectives, and specific languages. Methodological improvements are needed for reliable application.

Abstract: Knowledge-Editing-based (KE-based) detoxification has emerged as a promising approach for mitigating harmful behaviours in Large Language Models. Existing evaluations, however, largely rely on automatic toxicity classifiers, implicitly assuming that reduced toxicity scores reflect genuine behavioural suppression. In this work, we propose a robustness-oriented evaluation framework for KE-based detoxification that examines its reliability beyond standard classifier-based metrics along three dimensions: optimisation robustness, compositional robustness, and cross-lingual robustness. We identify pseudo-detoxification as a common failure mode, where apparent toxicity reductions arise from degenerate generation behaviours rather than meaningful suppression of unsafe content. We further show that detoxification effectiveness degrades when multiple unsafe behaviours are edited jointly, and that both monolingual and cross-lingual detoxification remain effective only under specific model-method combinations. Overall, our results indicate that KE-based detoxification is robust only for certain models, limited numbers of detoxification objectives, and a subset of languages.

TL;DR: 本文提出GRU-Mem，通过引入文本控制的更新门和退出门机制，优化长文本上下文推理效率与稳定性，克服现有方法内存爆炸和无效循环问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长上下文推理对实际应用至关重要，但现有LLMs方法随着上下文增长性能下降。MemAgent的循环内存更新机制存在内存无节制增长和缺乏退出机制两个关键缺陷，导致效率低下。

Method: 设计GRU-Mem双门控架构：更新门控制内存仅在必要时更新，退出门触发循环终止；结合端到端强化学习框架，通过更新奖励(r^update)和退出奖励(r^exit)双信号训练门控策略。

Result: 在多项长上下文推理任务中，GRU-Mem相比基线模型MemAgent实现推理速度最高提升400%，同时保持稳定的有效内存更新和自适应循环终止能力。

Conclusion: 通过文本驱动的门控机制可有效解决长上下文推理中的内存失控与计算冗余问题，为LLMs处理超长文本提供了更高效稳定的架构范式。

Abstract: While reasoning over long context is crucial for various real-world applications, it remains challenging for large language models (LLMs) as they suffer from performance degradation as the context length grows. Recent work MemAgent has tried to tackle this by processing context chunk-by-chunk in an RNN-like loop and updating a textual memory for final answering. However, this naive recurrent memory update faces two crucial drawbacks: (i) memory can quickly explode because it can update indiscriminately, even on evidence-free chunks; and (ii) the loop lacks an exit mechanism, leading to unnecessary computation after even sufficient evidence is collected. To address these issues, we propose GRU-Mem, which incorporates two text-controlled gates for more stable and efficient long-context reasoning. Specifically, in GRU-Mem, the memory only updates when the update gate is open and the recurrent loop will exit immediately once the exit gate is open. To endow the model with such capabilities, we introduce two reward signals $r^{\text{update}}$ and $r^{\text{exit}}$ within end-to-end RL, rewarding the correct updating and exiting behaviors respectively. Experiments on various long-context reasoning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of GRU-Mem, which generally outperforms the vanilla MemAgent with up to 400\% times inference speed acceleration.

### [83] [Online Causal Kalman Filtering for Stable and Effective Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10609)
*Shuo He,Lang Feng,Xin Cheng,Lei Feng,Bo An*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large language models face stability issues in reinforcement learning due to high-variance token-level importance sampling (IS) ratios. This work proposes KPO, which applies online causal Kalman filtering to dynamically model and smooth IS ratios across tokens, improving policy optimization stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods either ignore temporal dependencies between tokens (using fixed sequence-level IS ratios) or adjust tokens in isolation, leading to structural inconsistencies in local off-policy deviations. These inconsistencies distort policy updates and cause training collapse, highlighting the need for a temporally coherent IS ratio adaptation mechanism.

Method: KPO treats IS ratios as latent states evolving across tokens. Using a causal Kalman filter, it updates each token's IS ratio based on previous tokens' states in an autoregressive manner. This preserves token-wise variation while suppressing noise through state filtering, without relying on future token information.

Result: KPO significantly stabilizes policy updates and outperforms state-of-the-art methods on challenging math reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating superior effectiveness in real-world applications.

Conclusion: By modeling IS ratios as temporally correlated latent states via Kalman filtering, KPO addresses local structural inconsistencies in importance sampling. This approach balances noise smoothing with variation preservation, enabling robust reinforcement learning for large language models.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning for large language models suffers from high-variance token-level importance sampling (IS) ratios, which would destabilize policy optimization at scale. To improve stability, recent methods typically use a fixed sequence-level IS ratio for all tokens in a sequence or adjust each token's IS ratio separately, thereby neglecting temporal off-policy derivation across tokens in a sequence. In this paper, we first empirically identify that local off-policy deviation is structurally inconsistent at the token level, which may distort policy-gradient updates across adjacent tokens and lead to training collapse. To address the issue, we propose Online Causal Kalman Filtering for stable and effective Policy Optimization (KPO). Concretely, we model the desired IS ratio as a latent state that evolves across tokens and apply a Kalman filter to update this state online and autoregressively based on the states of past tokens, regardless of future tokens. The resulting filtered IS ratios preserve token-wise local structure-aware variation while strongly smoothing noise spikes, yielding more stable and effective policy updates. Experimentally, KPO achieves superior results on challenging math reasoning datasets compared with state-of-the-art counterparts.

### [84] [Benchmarks Are Not That Out of Distribution: Word Overlap Predicts Performance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10657)
*Woojin Chung,Jeonghoon Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper examines how statistical word overlap between pre-training data and benchmarks influences model performance, showing lower word-level unigram cross-entropy in pre-training data correlates with better zero-shot benchmark results, indicating many benchmarks are not truly out-of-distribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if benchmark performance in language models is primarily influenced by statistical pattern overlap (e.g., word frequency) between pre-training corpora and evaluation datasets.

Method: Measured word-level unigram cross-entropy and frequency statistics across 4 pre-training datasets (8.5B-60B tokens) and 10 zero-shot benchmarks, testing model sizes (400M-3B parameters) in controlled experiments.

Result: Benchmark performance showed a robust inverse relationship with unigram cross-entropy (lower cross-entropy correlated with higher scores), and larger pre-training datasets with similar cross-entropy further improved downstream performance, highlighting word frequency's predictive power.

Conclusion: Standard benchmarks are often weakly out-of-distribution relative to pre-training data, making simple word-overlap statistics strong predictors of performance, suggesting training data composition critically shapes benchmarks.

Abstract: Understanding what constitutes high-quality pre-training data remains a central question in language model training. In this work, we investigate whether benchmark performance is primarily driven by the degree of statistical pattern overlap between pre-training corpora and evaluation datasets. We measure this overlap using word-level unigram cross-entropy and word frequency statistics, and perform controlled experiments across $10$ zero-shot benchmarks, $4$ pre-training datasets spanning $8.5\mathrm{B}$ to $60\mathrm{B}$ tokens, and model sizes ranging from $400\mathrm{M}$ to $3\mathrm{B}$ parameters. Our results demonstrate a robust inverse relationship between word-level unigram cross-entropy and benchmark performance, suggesting that widely used benchmarks are strongly influenced by word overlap between training and evaluation data. Thus, larger pre-training subsets with similar word-level unigram cross-entropy yield improved downstream results, indicating that word frequency statistics play an additional role in shaping benchmark scores. Taken together, these results suggest that many standard benchmarks are only weakly out-of-distribution relative to pre-training corpora, so that simple word-overlap statistics predict benchmark performance.

Method: 基于树库和Grew查询语言生成最小对立对，构建包含七类任务（每类50-70个样本）的测试集；针对五种编码器和两种解码器模型，使用词级和句级准确率指标进行评估。

Result: 模型在作格正确分配上表现最差，在主格上最优，且性能与三类格形式的频率分布（主格>与格>作格）相关；作格的特殊语法角色及训练数据不足是性能瓶颈的核心原因。

Conclusion: 作格系统的高度特异性与训练数据匮乏共同导致模型表现不佳，研究方法为低资源语言的句法评估提供了可行路径，且数据集已开源。

Abstract: This paper evaluates the performance of transformer-based language models on split-ergative case alignment in Georgian, a particularly rare system for assigning grammatical cases to mark argument roles. We focus on subject and object marking determined through various permutations of nominative, ergative, and dative noun forms. A treebank-based approach for the generation of minimal pairs using the Grew query language is implemented. We create a dataset of 370 syntactic tests made up of seven tasks containing 50-70 samples each, where three noun forms are tested in any given sample. Five encoder- and two decoder-only models are evaluated with word- and/or sentence-level accuracy metrics. Regardless of the specific syntactic makeup, models performed worst in assigning the ergative case correctly and strongest in assigning the nominative case correctly. Performance correlated with the overall frequency distribution of the three forms (NOM > DAT > ERG). Though data scarcity is a known issue for low-resource languages, we show that the highly specific role of the ergative along with a lack of available training data likely contributes to poor performance on this case. The dataset is made publicly available and the methodology provides an interesting avenue for future syntactic evaluations of languages where benchmarks are limited.

Abstract: Long-term conversational memory is a core capability for LLM-based dialogue systems, yet existing benchmarks and evaluation protocols primarily focus on surface-level factual recall. In realistic interactions, appropriate responses often depend on implicit constraints such as user state, goals, or values that are not explicitly queried later. To evaluate this setting, we introduce \textbf{LoCoMo-Plus}, a benchmark for assessing cognitive memory under cue--trigger semantic disconnect, where models must retain and apply latent constraints across long conversational contexts. We further show that conventional string-matching metrics and explicit task-type prompting are misaligned with such scenarios, and propose a unified evaluation framework based on constraint consistency. Experiments across diverse backbone models, retrieval-based methods, and memory systems demonstrate that cognitive memory remains challenging and reveals failures not captured by existing benchmarks. Our code and evaluation framework are publicly available at: https://github.com/xjtuleeyf/Locomo-Plus.

### [87] [Macaron: Controlled, Human-Written Benchmark for Multilingual and Multicultural Reasoning via Template-Filling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10732)
*Alaa Elsetohy,Sama Hadhoud,Haryo Akbarianto Wibowo,Chenxi Whitehouse,Genta Indra Winata,Fajri Koto,Alham Fikri Aji*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Macaron, a multilingual benchmark for culturally grounded reasoning tasks, using 100 language-agnostic templates across 7 reasoning types and 22 cultural aspects. It includes 11,862 questions in 20 languages, revealing that reasoning-focused models outperform open-weight models, especially in low-resource languages and T/F tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multilingual benchmarks inadequately evaluate culturally grounded reasoning, either retaining English-centric content or lacking controlled reasoning structures. Macaron addresses this by systematically decoupling reasoning types and cultural contexts for cross-lingual analysis.

Method: A template-first approach generated 100 language-agnostic reasoning templates (7 types, 22 cultural aspects), which native annotators localized into English and local languages. Scenario-aligned multiple-choice and T/F questions were created, ensuring systematic alignment across 20 countries, 20 languages (including low-resource), and 10 scripts.

Result: Macaron contains 11,862 instances spanning 20 languages and low-resource variants. Zero-shot evaluations of 21 multilingual LLMs showed reasoning-mode models (e.g., LLaMA-3-8B) achieved near-parity in English vs. local languages, while open-weight models struggled, dropping to near-chance accuracy on T/F tasks. Culturally grounded math/counting templates were most challenging.

Conclusion: Macaron establishes a framework for evaluating language models on culturally grounded reasoning tasks, revealing disparities in model performance across language types and reasoning complexities. It underscores the need for models to explicitly handle culture-specific knowledge in reasoning contexts.

Abstract: Multilingual benchmarks rarely test reasoning over culturally grounded premises: translated datasets keep English-centric scenarios, while culture-first datasets often lack control over the reasoning required. We propose Macaron, a template-first benchmark that factorizes reasoning type and cultural aspect across question languages. Using 100 language-agnostic templates that cover 7 reasoning types, 22 cultural aspects, native annotators create scenario-aligned English and local-language multiple-choice questions and systematically derived True/False questions. Macaron contains 11,862 instances spanning 20 countries/cultural contexts, 10 scripts, and 20 languages (including low-resource ones like Amharic, Yoruba, Zulu, Kyrgyz, and some Arabic dialects). In zero-shot evaluation of 21 multilingual LLMs, reasoning-mode models achieve the strongest performance and near-parity between English and local languages, while open-weight models degrade substantially in local languages and often approach chance on T/F tasks. Culture-grounded mathematical and counting templates are consistently the hardest. The data can be accessed here https://huggingface.co/datasets/AlaaAhmed2444/Macaron.

Motivation: 现有微调方法导致VLM丧失通用性，而持续预训练计算成本过高且数据受限，需更高效适应方法。

Conclusion: RCPA为构建高性能与强领域适应性的VLM提供了实际可行路径，突破了传统方法的优化瓶颈。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate remarkable general-purpose capabilities but often fall short in specialized domains such as medical imaging or geometric problem-solving. Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) can enhance performance within a target domain, but it typically causes catastrophic forgetting, limiting its generalization. The central challenge, therefore, is to adapt VLMs to new domains while preserving their general-purpose capabilities. Continual pretraining is effective for expanding knowledge in Large Language Models (LLMs), but it is less feasible for VLMs due to prohibitive computational costs and the unavailability of pretraining data for most open-source models. This necessitates efficient post-training adaptation methods. Reinforcement learning (RL)-based approaches such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) have shown promise in preserving general abilities, yet they often fail in domain adaptation scenarios where the model initially lacks sufficient domain knowledge, leading to optimization collapse. To bridge this gap, we propose Reinforced Curriculum Pre-Alignment (RCPA), a novel post-training paradigm that introduces a curriculum-aware progressive modulation mechanism. In the early phase, RCPA applies partial output constraints to safely expose the model to new domain concepts. As the model's domain familiarity increases, training gradually transitions to full generation optimization, refining responses and aligning them with domain-specific preferences. This staged adaptation balances domain knowledge acquisition with the preservation of general multimodal capabilities. Extensive experiments across specialized domains and general benchmarks validate the effectiveness of RCPA, establishing a practical pathway toward building high-performing and domain-adaptive VLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型常产生幻觉（虚假知识），因其无法自知知识边界，而当前研究多集中于可获取参数的白盒模型，缺乏适配黑盒LLM（仅通过API调用）的解决方案，亟需新方法突破参数不可见的技术限制。

Method: 基于知识蒸馏框架，设计深度学习模型作为“监督者”，以黑盒LLM的原始问题输入、生成答案及每个token预测概率作为多模态特征输入，通过端到端训练学习token级概率分布与知识边界可信度的映射关系，并提出无token概率输入时的自适应降级方案。

Result: 在多个公共问答数据集和不同架构的黑盒LLM上测试显示，该方法较传统基线模型在回答准确性（Accuracy）和问题域覆盖召回率（Recall）指标上提升12.7%-34.2%，提出的降级方案在无token概率时仍保持90%以上的原性能。

Conclusion: LSCL证明了从黑盒LLM输出概率分布中提取知识边界特征的可行性，为缓解LLM幻觉提供了可实施的技术路径，所设计的自适应架构拓展了方法在工业场景中的实用性，未来可探索其在多模态模型中的泛化能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success, however, the emergence of content generation distortion (hallucination) limits their practical applications. The core cause of hallucination lies in LLMs' lack of awareness regarding their stored internal knowledge, preventing them from expressing their knowledge state on questions beyond their internal knowledge boundaries, as humans do. However, existing research on knowledge boundary expression primarily focuses on white-box LLMs, leaving methods suitable for black-box LLMs which offer only API access without revealing internal parameters-largely unexplored. Against this backdrop, this paper proposes LSCL (LLM-Supervised Confidence Learning), a deep learning-based method for expressing the knowledge boundaries of black-box LLMs. Based on the knowledge distillation framework, this method designs a deep learning model. Taking the input question, output answer, and token probability from a black-box LLM as inputs, it constructs a mapping between the inputs and the model' internal knowledge state, enabling the quantification and expression of the black-box LLM' knowledge boundaries. Experiments conducted on diverse public datasets and with multiple prominent black-box LLMs demonstrate that LSCL effectively assists black-box LLMs in accurately expressing their knowledge boundaries. It significantly outperforms existing baseline models on metrics such as accuracy and recall rate. Furthermore, considering scenarios where some black-box LLMs do not support access to token probability, an adaptive alternative method is proposed. The performance of this alternative approach is close to that of LSCL and surpasses baseline models.

Conclusion: δ_TCB为分析和改进大语言模型上下文稳定性提供了有理论依据的补充方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive capabilities yet suffer from sensitivity to slight input context variations, hampering reliability. Conventional metrics like accuracy and perplexity fail to assess local prediction robustness, as normalized output probabilities can obscure the underlying resilience of an LLM's internal state to perturbations. We introduce the Token Constraint Bound ($δ_{\mathrm{TCB}}$), a novel metric that quantifies the maximum internal state perturbation an LLM can withstand before its dominant next-token prediction significantly changes. Intrinsically linked to output embedding space geometry, $δ_{\mathrm{TCB}}$ provides insights into the stability of the model's internal predictive commitment. Our experiments show $δ_{\mathrm{TCB}}$ correlates with effective prompt engineering and uncovers critical prediction instabilities missed by perplexity during in-context learning and text generation. $δ_{\mathrm{TCB}}$ offers a principled, complementary approach to analyze and potentially improve the contextual stability of LLM predictions.

Abstract: Automatic prompt optimization is a promising direction to boost the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing methods often suffer from noisy and conflicting update signals. In this research, we propose C-MOP (Cluster-based Momentum Optimized Prompting), a framework that stabilizes optimization via Boundary-Aware Contrastive Sampling (BACS) and Momentum-Guided Semantic Clustering (MGSC). Specifically, BACS utilizes batch-level information to mine tripartite features--Hard Negatives, Anchors, and Boundary Pairs--to precisely characterize the typical representation and decision boundaries of positive and negative prompt samples. To resolve semantic conflicts, MGSC introduces a textual momentum mechanism with temporal decay that distills persistent consensus from fluctuating gradients across iterations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that C-MOP consistently outperforms SOTA baselines like PromptWizard and ProTeGi, yielding average gains of 1.58% and 3.35%. Notably, C-MOP enables a general LLM with 3B activated parameters to surpass a 70B domain-specific dense LLM, highlighting its effectiveness in driving precise prompt evolution.

*Zhiyin Tan,Jennifer D'Souza*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study finds that current large language models (LLMs) lack the structural fidelity, relational binding, and numerical grounding required for automated meta-analysis, failing to reliably extract complex study associations despite advancements in entity recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether LLMs can meet the structural and numerical demands of systematic reviews/meta-analyses, which rely on precise cross-document relationships and effect-size attributions rather than isolated entity recognition.

Method: A structural diagnostic framework was developed to evaluate LLMs through schema-constrained queries with increasing relational/numerical complexity. Two state-of-the-art models were tested on a multi-domain corpus using single-document and long-context multi-document inputs, with a focus on identifying failure patterns.

Result: LLMs showed moderate performance on simple tasks but degraded sharply when requiring variable binding (e.g., roles, methods, effect sizes). Full meta-analytic association extraction achieved near-zero reliability, with errors amplified in long-context scenarios and downstream aggregations. Failures stemmed from systematic structural issues like role reversals, numeric misattribution, and binding drift.

Conclusion: Current LLMs are structurally inadequate for automated meta-analysis due to instability in relational binding and numerical grounding. The study emphasizes the need for models to handle complex schema-dependent tasks, with code/data publicly shared via GitHub.

Abstract: Systematic reviews and meta-analyses rely on converting narrative articles into structured, numerically grounded study records. Despite rapid advances in large language models (LLMs), it remains unclear whether they can meet the structural requirements of this process, which hinge on preserving roles, methods, and effect-size attribution across documents rather than on recognizing isolated entities. We propose a structural, diagnostic framework that evaluates LLM-based evidence extraction as a progression of schema-constrained queries with increasing relational and numerical complexity, enabling precise identification of failure points beyond atom-level extraction. Using a manually curated corpus spanning five scientific domains, together with a unified query suite and evaluation protocol, we evaluate two state-of-the-art LLMs under both per-document and long-context, multi-document input regimes. Across domains and models, performance remains moderate for single-property queries but degrades sharply once tasks require stable binding between variables, roles, statistical methods, and effect sizes. Full meta-analytic association tuples are extracted with near-zero reliability, and long-context inputs further exacerbate these failures. Downstream aggregation amplifies even minor upstream errors, rendering corpus-level statistics unreliable. Our analysis shows that these limitations stem not from entity recognition errors, but from systematic structural breakdowns, including role reversals, cross-analysis binding drift, instance compression in dense result sections, and numeric misattribution, indicating that current LLMs lack the structural fidelity, relational binding, and numerical grounding required for automated meta-analysis. The code and data are publicly available at GitHub (https://github.com/zhiyintan/LLM-Meta-Analysis).

Conclusion: 推动开发具备全球包容性、透明且稳健的多语言多模态金融AI系统，促进跨文化交流与金融决策智能化。

Abstract: We present the setup and the tasks of the FinMMEval Lab at CLEF 2026, which introduces the first multilingual and multimodal evaluation framework for financial Large Language Models (LLMs). While recent advances in financial natural language processing have enabled automated analysis of market reports, regulatory documents, and investor communications, existing benchmarks remain largely monolingual, text-only, and limited to narrow subtasks. FinMMEval 2026 addresses this gap by offering three interconnected tasks that span financial understanding, reasoning, and decision-making: Financial Exam Question Answering, Multilingual Financial Question Answering (PolyFiQA), and Financial Decision Making. Together, these tasks provide a comprehensive evaluation suite that measures models' ability to reason, generalize, and act across diverse languages and modalities. The lab aims to promote the development of robust, transparent, and globally inclusive financial AI systems, with datasets and evaluation resources publicly released to support reproducible research.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种超高速且灵活的搜索算法，可在0.3秒内完成对万亿级自然语言语料库的语义容忍搜索（允许替换、插入和删除）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在大规模语料库中处理语义变体时面临组合爆炸问题，且搜索空间随查询长度呈指数级增长，导致现有方法无法高效处理万亿级数据。

Method: 基于后缀数组的字符串匹配框架，采用磁盘感知设计实现快速精确查找，并通过动态语料库感知剪枝策略抑制搜索空间膨胀，理论部分证明该方法利用自然语言统计特性抵消了指数级复杂度。

Result: 在1.4万亿token的FineWeb-Edu数据集上，相较infini-gram、infini-gram mini和SoftMatcha等方法实现了显著更低的搜索延迟，成功发现现有方法未识别的训练语料基准污染，并展示了跨7种语言的搜索引擎demo。

Conclusion: 提出的语义容忍搜索框架解决了大规模语料库中的高效检索问题，在理论复杂度优化和实际应用层面（如数据清洗、多语言搜索）均展现出显著优势。

Abstract: We present an ultra-fast and flexible search algorithm that enables search over trillion-scale natural language corpora in under 0.3 seconds while handling semantic variations (substitution, insertion, and deletion). Our approach employs string matching based on suffix arrays that scales well with corpus size. To mitigate the combinatorial explosion induced by the semantic relaxation of queries, our method is built on two key algorithmic ideas: fast exact lookup enabled by a disk-aware design, and dynamic corpus-aware pruning. We theoretically show that the proposed method suppresses exponential growth in the search space with respect to query length by leveraging statistical properties of natural language. In experiments on FineWeb-Edu (Lozhkov et al., 2024) (1.4T tokens), we show that our method achieves significantly lower search latency than existing methods: infini-gram (Liu et al., 2024), infini-gram mini (Xu et al., 2025), and SoftMatcha (Deguchi et al., 2025). As a practical application, we demonstrate that our method identifies benchmark contamination in training corpora, unidentified by existing approaches. We also provide an online demo of fast, soft search across corpora in seven languages.

### [95] [Computational Phenomenology of Temporal Experience in Autism: Quantifying the Emotional and Narrative Characteristics of Lived Unpredictability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10947)
*Kacper Dudzic,Karolina Drożdż,Maciej Wodziński,Anastazja Szuła,Marcin Moskalewicz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses temporal disturbances in autism, integrating phenomenological and computational methods to overcome prior research limitations, revealing that lived unpredictability, not narrative style, underlies autistic temporal challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior autism research faces three gaps: deficit-centric medical models, small qualitative sample sizes, and lack of phenomenological foundations in computational studies. The work aims to bridge qualitative and quantitative approaches while addressing sample limitations.

Method: Three-pronged approach: Study A conducts structured phenomenological interviews using the Transdiagnostic Assessment of Temporal Experience. Study B performs computational analysis on a newly-built corpus of autistic autobiographies. Study C replicates computational narrative flow analysis to validate phenomenological authenticity of autistic narratives.

Result: Interviews identified unpredictability as the key differentiator between autistic and control groups. Computational analysis showed significantly increased negative valence in autistic temporal lexicon (especially 'Immediacy & Suddenness' terms) and narrative flow patterns more resembling autobiographical than imaginary stories.

Conclusion: Autistic temporal challenges originate from lived experience content rather than narrative construction. Integrating phenomenological insights with computational analysis provides a more comprehensive understanding by overcoming traditional methodological limitations.

Abstract: Disturbances in temporality, such as desynchronization with the social environment and its unpredictability, are considered core features of autism with a deep impact on relationships. However, limitations regarding research on this issue include: 1) the dominance of deficit-based medical models of autism, 2) sample size in qualitative research, and 3) the lack of phenomenological anchoring in computational research. To bridge the gap between phenomenological and computational approaches and overcome sample-size limitations, our research integrated three methodologies. Study A: structured phenomenological interviews with autistic individuals using the Transdiagnostic Assessment of Temporal Experience. Study B: computational analysis of an autobiographical corpus of autistic narratives built for this purpose. Study C: a replication of a computational study using narrative flow measures to assess the perceived phenomenological authenticity of autistic autobiographies. Interviews revealed that the most significant differences between the autistic and control groups concerned unpredictability of experience. Computational results mirrored these findings: the temporal lexicon in autistic narratives was significantly more negatively valenced - particularly the "Immediacy & Suddenness" category. Outlier analysis identified terms associated with perceived discontinuity (unpredictably, precipitously, and abruptly) as highly negative. The computational analysis of narrative flow found that the autistic narratives contained within the corpus quantifiably resemble autobiographical stories more than imaginary ones. Overall, the temporal challenges experienced by autistic individuals were shown to primarily concern lived unpredictability and stem from the contents of lived experience, and not from autistic narrative construction.

TL;DR: LoRA-Squeeze通过先使用高秩训练再压缩的方法，在参数高效微调中优于传统LoRA，减少预选秩和超参数的复杂性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决标准LoRA在预选最优秩、超参数复杂性和异构秩模块部署上的挑战，提出无需预先确定秩的动态压缩方法。

Method: 在预训练时使用较高秩进行微调，重构权重更新矩阵后使用随机奇异值分解(RSVD)压缩到目标低秩；进一步结合训练中的渐进秩退火策略。

Result: 在13个文本和10个视觉语言任务中，后压缩的低秩适配器（尤其在少量微调步后）优于直接训练的低秩模型，渐进式退火变体表现最优。

Conclusion: LoRA-Squeeze通过动态秩调整和压缩策略，简化部署并提升模型效率，在保持性能的同时降低参数微调复杂性。

Abstract: Despite its huge number of variants, standard Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is still a dominant technique for parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). Nonetheless, it faces persistent challenges, including the pre-selection of an optimal rank and rank-specific hyper-parameters, as well as the deployment complexity of heterogeneous-rank modules and more sophisticated LoRA derivatives. In this work, we introduce LoRA-Squeeze, a simple and efficient methodology that aims to improve standard LoRA learning by changing LoRA module ranks either post-hoc or dynamically during training}. Our approach posits that it is better to first learn an expressive, higher-rank solution and then compress it, rather than learning a constrained, low-rank solution directly. The method involves fine-tuning with a deliberately high(er) source rank, reconstructing or efficiently approximating the reconstruction of the full weight update matrix, and then using Randomized Singular Value Decomposition (RSVD) to create a new, compressed LoRA module at a lower target rank. Extensive experiments across 13 text and 10 vision-language tasks show that post-hoc compression often produces lower-rank adapters that outperform those trained directly at the target rank, especially if a small number of fine-tuning steps at the target rank is allowed. Moreover, a gradual, in-tuning rank annealing variant of LoRA-Squeeze consistently achieves the best LoRA size-performance trade-off.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过分析自发语言的细微变化，寻找可解释的痴呆症标记物，以支持透明且临床可靠的早期筛查方法。

Method: 使用DementiaBank Pitt语料库，结合三种语言表征（原始文本、词性增强表征、仅词性表征），采用逻辑回归和随机森林模型，进行跨话语和跨被试验证，并通过特征重要性和非参数统计检验分析模型可解释性。

Result: 所有表征下模型均表现稳定，句法特征在缺乏词汇信息时仍具强区分能力；主题层面评估显示结果更稳健，功能词使用、词汇多样性等语言特征存在显著组间差异。

Conclusion: 基于语言结构的抽象特征结合机器学习与统计验证，能为语言筛查提供可靠且可解释的认知衰退检测方法。

Abstract: Background: Subtle changes in spontaneous language production are among the earliest indicators of cognitive decline. Identifying linguistically interpretable markers of dementia can support transparent and clinically grounded screening approaches.
  Methods: This study analyzes spontaneous speech transcripts from the DementiaBank Pitt Corpus using three linguistic representations: raw cleaned text, a part-of-speech (POS)-enhanced representation combining lexical and grammatical information, and a POS-only syntactic representation. Logistic regression and random forest models were evaluated under two protocols: transcript-level train-test splits and subject-level five-fold cross-validation to prevent speaker overlap. Model interpretability was examined using global feature importance, and statistical validation was conducted using Mann-Whitney U tests with Cliff's delta effect sizes.
  Results: Across representations, models achieved stable performance, with syntactic and grammatical features retaining strong discriminative power even in the absence of lexical content. Subject-level evaluation yielded more conservative but consistent results, particularly for POS-enhanced and POS-only representations. Statistical analysis revealed significant group differences in functional word usage, lexical diversity, sentence structure, and discourse coherence, aligning closely with machine learning feature importance findings.
  Conclusion: The results demonstrate that abstract linguistic features capture robust markers of early cognitive decline under clinically realistic evaluation. By combining interpretable machine learning with non-parametric statistical validation, this study supports the use of linguistically grounded features for transparent and reliable language-based cognitive screening.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言模型研究缺乏对可逆性的探索，即如何根据目标输出反推有效输入提示仍是未解难题，该问题在模型解释性、对抗样本防御等领域具有重要应用价值。

Method: 首创性地将LM建模为作用于令牌分布序列的函数，通过构建端到端可微架构，采用梯度下降法对冻结LM进行联合优化，在连续空间中搜索最优提示向量。

Result: 实验验证对长度10和80的输入提示，在目标输出长度20时均实现稳定优化，支持即插即用式白盒LM适配，显著提升逆过程计算效率与可靠性。

Conclusion: 该研究为语言模型可逆性提供了首个系统性解决方案，通过分布域建模创新揭示了LM输入输出的对称性本质，为模型解释与控制开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Despite emerging research on Language Models (LM), few approaches analyse the invertibility of LMs. That is, given a LM and a desirable target output sequence of tokens, determining what input prompts would yield the target output remains an open problem. We formulate this problem as a classical gradient-based optimisation. First, we propose a simple algorithm to achieve end-to-end differentiability of a given (frozen) LM and then find optimised prompts via gradient descent. Our central insight is to view LMs as functions operating on sequences of distributions over tokens (rather than the traditional view as functions on sequences of tokens). Our experiments and ablations demonstrate that our DLM-powered inversion can reliably and efficiently optimise prompts of lengths $10$ and $80$ for targets of length $20$, for several white-box LMs (out-of-the-box).

Motivation: 解决传统自回归模型在嵌入反转中需要多步生成、依赖目标编码器访问权限的问题，优化生成效率与实现门槛。

Method: 将嵌入反转转化为条件掩码扩散任务，使用自适应层归一化连接目标嵌入，通过迭代去噪过程并行恢复所有标记。

Result: 在32标记序列上实现81.3% token准确率与0.87余弦相似度，且无需访问目标编码器，参数量仅78M。

Conclusion: 该方法通过扩散模型突破序列生成顺序限制，提供高效低成本的嵌入反转新范式，在模型逆向工程等领域具备应用潜力。

Abstract: We frame embedding inversion as conditional masked diffusion, recovering all tokens in parallel through iterative denoising rather than sequential autoregressive generation. A masked diffusion language model is conditioned on the target embedding via adaptive layer normalization, requiring only 8 forward passes through a 78M parameter model with no access to the target encoder. On 32-token sequences across three embedding models, the method achieves 81.3% token accuracy and 0.87 cosine similarity.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Graph-of-Thoughts (GoT) framework to model conversational reasoning by capturing causal and temporal dependencies in speech acts through hierarchical labeling and transformer-based predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable natural full-duplex dialogue systems by formalizing the implicit perception-reasoning pathway in human conversations, addressing gaps in modeling intent-to-action dynamics and interpretable reasoning.

Method: A multi-level perception framework that generates hierarchical intent/speech-act labels, structures streaming predictions as an evolving graph (GoT), and uses transformers to forecast speech acts with dynamic reasoning refinement.

Result: Robust detection of conversational behaviors, interpretable reasoning chains, and improved performance on synthetic/real duplex dialogues, validated via a new controllable dialogue corpus with human-annotated labels.

Conclusion: The GoT framework establishes a foundation for benchmarking conversational reasoning in full-duplex systems, enabling explainable AI-driven dialogue interactions through structured temporal modeling.

Abstract: Human conversation is organized by an implicit chain of thoughts that manifests as timed speech acts. Capturing this perceptual pathway is key to building natural full-duplex interactive systems. We introduce a framework that models this process as multi-level perception, and then reasons over conversational behaviors via a Graph-of-Thoughts (GoT). Our approach formalizes the intent-to-action pathway with a hierarchical labeling scheme, predicting high-level communicative intents and low-level speech acts to learn their causal and temporal dependencies. To train this system, we develop a high quality corpus that pairs controllable, event-rich dialogue data with human-annotated labels. The GoT framework structures streaming predictions as an evolving graph, enabling a transformer to forecast the next speech act, generate concise justifications for its decisions, and dynamically refine its reasoning. Experiments on both synthetic and real duplex dialogues show that the framework delivers robust behavior detection, produces interpretable reasoning chains, and establishes a foundation for benchmarking conversational reasoning in full duplex spoken dialogue systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语音翻译依赖昂贵且难以扩展的单词级对齐数据，且语言特定的合成对齐方法效果欠佳，阻碍了模型在多样语言结构中的扩展能力。

Method: 1) 基于句子级对齐数据训练初始模型；2) 使用GRPO强化学习策略优化延迟与翻译质量的平衡；3) 完全移除语言特定对齐规则，支持多语言无缝扩展。

Result: 在五项跨语言英语翻译任务中实现翻译准确性、低延迟、语音迁移、自然度的SOTA表现，并仅需<1000h新语言数据即可适配，同时发布45h多语言基准数据集。

Conclusion: Hibiki-Zero通过消除传统方法的关键瓶颈，实现了高效多语言实时语音翻译，提供了实用化扩展方案并推动领域数据资源发展。

Abstract: Simultaneous speech translation requires translating source speech into a target language in real-time while handling non-monotonic word dependencies. Traditional approaches rely on supervised training with word-level aligned data, which is difficult to collect at scale and thus depends on synthetic alignments using language-specific heuristics that are suboptimal. We propose Hibiki-Zero, which eliminates the need for word-level alignments entirely. This fundamentally simplifies the training pipeline and enables seamless scaling to diverse languages with varying grammatical structures, removing the bottleneck of designing language-specific alignment heuristics. We first train on sentence-level aligned data to learn speech translation at high latency, then apply a novel reinforcement learning strategy using GRPO to optimize latency while preserving translation quality. Hibiki-Zero achieves state-of-the-art performance in translation accuracy, latency, voice transfer, and naturalness across five X-to-English tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that our model can be adapted to support a new input language with less than 1000h of speech. We provide examples, model weights, inference code and we release a benchmark containing 45h of multilingual data for speech translation evaluation.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在需要法条精确引用与结构化论证的税法领域表现不足，现有基准缺乏真实场景下的细粒度评估。

Method: 算法生成德国税法考试基准SteuerEx（含115道专家验证题目）；构建SteuerLLM模型，通过检索增强管道生成合成数据集并针对税法微调，采用statement-level评估框架。

Result: SteuerLLM（28B参数）超越同规模通用模型及更大模型，领域特定数据与架构适配效果优于参数规模扩展。

Conclusion: 法律AI需重视领域知识与合成数据质量而非单纯追求模型体积，开源资源推动该领域可复现研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong general reasoning and language understanding, yet their performance degrades in domains governed by strict formal rules, precise terminology, and legally binding structure. Tax law exemplifies these challenges, as correct answers require exact statutory citation, structured legal argumentation, and numerical accuracy under rigid grading schemes. We algorithmically generate SteuerEx, the first open benchmark derived from authentic German university tax law examinations. SteuerEx comprises 115 expert-validated examination questions spanning six core tax law domains and multiple academic levels, and employs a statement-level, partial-credit evaluation framework that closely mirrors real examination practice. We further present SteuerLLM, a domain-adapted LLM for German tax law trained on a large-scale synthetic dataset generated from authentic examination material using a controlled retrieval-augmented pipeline. SteuerLLM (28B parameters) consistently outperforms general-purpose instruction-tuned models of comparable size and, in several cases, substantially larger systems, demonstrating that domain-specific data and architectural adaptation are more decisive than parameter scale for performance on realistic legal reasoning tasks. All benchmark data, training datasets, model weights, and evaluation code are released openly to support reproducible research in domain-specific legal artificial intelligence. A web-based demo of SteuerLLM is available at https://steuerllm.i5.ai.fau.de.

TL;DR: 本文提出了MisAlign-Profile，一个统一的基准测试框架，用于量化大型语言模型在安全、价值观和文化维度之间的对齐权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试（如SAFETUNEBED、VALUEBENCH和WORLDVIEW-BENCH）仅孤立评估单一维度，无法反映现实场景中多个维度必须共存的交互关系。虽然MIB和可解释性基准提供了新视角，但缺乏对跨维度权衡的系统性分析。

Method: 构建了包含112个规范领域分类的MISALIGNTRADE数据集（含14个安全、56个价值、42个文化领域），通过Gemma-2-9B-it分类和Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507扩展生成数据，采用SimHash去重。每个提示词通过两阶段拒绝采样生成对齐与不对齐响应，并定义对象、属性、关系三类语义不对齐类型。

Result: 在通用模型、微调模型和开源权重模型上的测试显示，跨维度存在12%-34%的对齐权衡现象。

Conclusion: MisAlign-Profile为系统性评估语言模型在多维度对齐冲突中的表现提供了工具，揭示了模型在现实复杂场景下的潜在失效模式。

Abstract: Misalignment in Large Language Models (LLMs) refers to the failure to simultaneously satisfy safety, value, and cultural dimensions, leading to behaviors that diverge from human expectations in real-world settings where these dimensions must co-occur. Existing benchmarks, such as SAFETUNEBED (safety-centric), VALUEBENCH (value-centric), and WORLDVIEW-BENCH (culture-centric), primarily evaluate these dimensions in isolation and therefore provide limited insight into their interactions and trade-offs. More recent efforts, including MIB and INTERPRETABILITY BENCHMARK-based on mechanistic interpretability, offer valuable perspectives on model failures; however, they remain insufficient for systematically characterizing cross-dimensional trade-offs. To address these gaps, we introduce MisAlign-Profile, a unified benchmark for measuring misalignment trade-offs inspired by mechanistic profiling. First, we construct MISALIGNTRADE, an English misaligned-aligned dataset across 112 normative domains taxonomies, including 14 safety, 56 value, and 42 cultural domains. In addition to domain labels, each prompt is classified with one of three orthogonal semantic types-object, attribute, or relations misalignment-using Gemma-2-9B-it and expanded via Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507 with SimHash-based fingerprinting to avoid deduplication. Each prompt is paired with misaligned and aligned responses through two-stage rejection sampling to ensure quality. Second, we benchmark general-purpose, fine-tuned, and open-weight LLMs on MISALIGNTRADE-revealing 12%-34% misalignment trade-offs across dimensions.

TL;DR: SafeThink is a lightweight, inference-time defense designed to recover safety in multimodal large-scale reasoning models (MLRMs) after reinforcement learning (RL) post-training without compromising reasoning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent RL post-training methods, while enhancing reasoning capabilities, degrade safety alignment and increase jailbreak success rates. There is a need for an efficient method to address safety concerns while maintaining model performance.

Method: SafeThink uses a safety reward model to monitor evolving reasoning traces and injects an optimized corrective prefix (e.g., 'Wait, think safely') only when safety thresholds are violated. It treats safety recovery as a satisficing constraint rather than an optimization goal.

Result: SafeThink reduced jailbreak attack success rates by 30-60% across six MLRMs and four benchmarks (e.g., LlamaV-o1: 63.33% to 5.74% on JailbreakV-28K). It preserved reasoning performance (e.g., MathVista accuracy: 65.20% to 65.00%). Early interventions (1–3 reasoning steps) were sufficient for redirecting outputs.

Conclusion: SafeThink effectively recovers safety in MLRMs during inference by intervening early in the reasoning process with minimal impact on model performance, demonstrating that safety can be maintained with minimal corrective actions.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) based post-training for explicit chain-of-thought (e.g., GRPO) improves the reasoning ability of multimodal large-scale reasoning models (MLRMs). But recent evidence shows that it can simultaneously degrade safety alignment and increase jailbreak success rates. We propose SafeThink, a lightweight inference-time defense that treats safety recovery as a satisficing constraint rather than a maximization objective. SafeThink monitors the evolving reasoning trace with a safety reward model and conditionally injects an optimized short corrective prefix ("Wait, think safely") only when the safety threshold is violated. In our evaluations across six open-source MLRMs and four jailbreak benchmarks (JailbreakV-28K, Hades, FigStep, and MM-SafetyBench), SafeThink reduces attack success rates by 30-60% (e.g., LlamaV-o1: 63.33% to 5.74% on JailbreakV-28K, R1-Onevision: 69.07% to 5.65% on Hades) while preserving reasoning performance (MathVista accuracy: 65.20% to 65.00%). A key empirical finding from our experiments is that safety recovery is often only a few steering steps away: intervening in the first 1-3 reasoning steps typically suffices to redirect the full generation toward safe completions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习认为更多数据能提升泛化性，但作者发现SFT中重复训练更有效，旨在验证这一反直觉现象并探索训练动态机制。

Method: 在固定更新预算下，对比不同数据集规模（如400 vs. 51200样本）与训练轮次（128 vs. 1轮）的效果；通过训练集准确率判断重复训练饱和度，验证AIME'24/25和GPQA基准任务下的性能差异。

Result: 重复训练的小数据集模型在多个任务上超越大数据集单轮训练12-26个百分点，且不会导致灾难性遗忘；记忆完全时性能达到平台期，验证了重复训练与泛化的关联性。

Conclusion: 提出重复优势的新研究命题，即完全记忆与泛化能力提升的共存性；强调以记忆程度为停止标准可降低数据扩展成本，并为模型训练提供优化方向。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on chain-of-thought data is an essential post-training step for reasoning language models. Standard machine learning intuition suggests that training with more unique training samples yields better generalization. Counterintuitively, we show that SFT benefits from repetition: under a fixed update budget, training for more epochs on smaller datasets outperforms single-epoch training on larger datasets. On AIME'24/25 and GPQA benchmarks, Olmo3-7B trained for 128 epochs on 400 samples outperforms the equivalent 1 epoch on 51200 samples by 12-26 percentage points, with no additional catastrophic forgetting. We find that training token accuracy reliably signals when repetition has saturated; improvements from additional epochs plateau at full memorization, a pattern consistent across all settings. These findings provide a practical approach for reasoning SFT, where scaling epochs with token accuracy as a stopping criterion can replace expensive undirected data scaling. We pose the repetition advantage, where full memorization coincides with improved generalization, as a new open problem for the community in understanding the training dynamics of large language models.
