### [1] [SkyCap: Bitemporal VHR Optical-SAR Quartets for Amplitude Change Detection and Foundation-Model Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14755)
*Paul Weinmann,Ferdinand Schenck,Martin Šiklar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为SkyCap的双时相高分辨率光学-SAR数据集，通过归档匹配和配准SkySat光学和Capella SAR影像，结合光学到SAR标签迁移，解决了线性基础设施监测中SAR数据标注困难的问题，并评估了不同预训练模型在SAR振幅变化检测中的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 光学高分辨率影像易受云层遮蔽影响获取频率，而SAR影像虽能全天候采集但标注困难，因此需要构建可靠且高效的多源数据集与模型评估框架。

Method: 通过档案匹配和共配准生成SkyCap数据集，采用光学标签迁移生成SAR变化检测标签；对SARATR-X模型进行持续预训练，对比SAR专用模型与光学模型在不同预处理方法下的性能差异。

Result: 使用dB+Z-score预处理的MTP(ViT-B+RVSA)光学模型达到最佳F1c=45.06，超过直接在SAR数据上预训练的专用模型，且模型表现对预处理与统计特征对齐度敏感。

Conclusion: 首次在高分辨率SAR振幅变化检测任务中验证基础模型性能，证明光学模型迁移优于SAR专用模型，为跨模态监测提供了新方法。

Abstract: Change detection for linear infrastructure monitoring requires reliable high-resolution data and regular acquisition cadence. Optical very-high-resolution (VHR) imagery is interpretable and straightforward to label, but clouds break this cadence. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) enables all-weather acquisitions, yet is difficult to annotate. We introduce SkyCap, a bitemporal VHR optical-SAR dataset constructed by archive matching and co-registration of (optical) SkySat and Capella Space (SAR) scenes. We utilize optical-to-SAR label transfer to obtain SAR amplitude change detection (ACD) labels without requiring SAR-expert annotations. We perform continued pretraining of SARATR-X on our SAR data and benchmark the resulting SAR-specific foundation models (FMs) together with SARATR-X against optical FMs on SkyCap under different preprocessing choices. Among evaluated models, MTP(ViT-B+RVSA), an optical FM, with dB+Z-score preprocessing attains the best result (F1$_c$ = 45.06), outperforming SAR-specific FMs further pretrained directly on Capella data. We observe strong sensitivity to preprocessing alignment with pretraining statistics, and the ranking of optical models on optical change detection does not transfer one-to-one to SAR ACD. To our knowledge, this is the first evaluation of foundation models on VHR SAR ACD.

### [2] [SocialNav-MoE: A Mixture-of-Experts Vision Language Model for Socially Compliant Navigation with Reinforcement Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14757)
*Tomohito Kawabata,Xinyu Zhang,Ling Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes SocialNav-MoE, an efficient Mixture-of-Experts vision language model with reinforcement fine-tuning and a semantic similarity reward, to achieve socially compliant navigation on resource-constrained robots, balancing real-time performance and human-aware decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in socially compliant navigation for robots (prioritizing safety over social norms) and overcome computational limitations of large VLMs in real-time deployment on resource-constrained platforms.

Method: Develop a lightweight SocialNav-MoE model combining VLM components (Phi/Qwen/StableLM, CLIP/SigLIP) with reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), enhanced by a novel semantic similarity reward (SSR), and evaluate different model architectures and training strategies.

Result: SocialNav-MoE achieves superior accuracy-efficiency trade-offs on the SNEI dataset, with SSR outperforming traditional reward functions, demonstrating the effectiveness of compact VLMs for social navigation in real-time robot applications.

Conclusion: The study successfully bridges social compliance and computational efficiency in robotic navigation, providing a practical framework for deploying vision language models in human-centric environments with limited resources.

Abstract: For robots navigating in human-populated environments, safety and social compliance are equally critical, yet prior work has mostly emphasized safety. Socially compliant navigation that accounts for human comfort, social norms, and contextual appropriateness remains underexplored. Vision language models (VLMs) show promise for this task; however, large-scale models incur substantial computational overhead, leading to higher inference latency and energy consumption, which makes them unsuitable for real-time deployment on resource-constrained robotic platforms. To address this issue, we investigate the effectiveness of small VLM and propose SocialNav-MoE, an efficient Mixture-of-Experts vision language model for socially compliant navigation with reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT). We further introduce a semantic similarity reward (SSR) to effectively leverage RFT for enhancing the decision-making capabilities. Additionally, we study the effectiveness of different small language model types (Phi, Qwen, and StableLM), routing strategies, and vision encoders (CLIP vs. SigLIP, frozen vs. fine-tuned). Experiments on the SNEI dataset demonstrate that SocialNav-MoE achieves an excellent balance between navigation accuracy and efficiency. The proposed SSR function is more effective than hard-level and character-level rewards. Source code will be released upon acceptance.

### [3] [The Renaissance of Expert Systems: Optical Recognition of Printed Chinese Jianpu Musical Scores with Lyrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14758)
*Fan Bu,Rongfeng Li,Zijin Li,Ya Li,Linfeng Fan,Pei Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无需大规模标注数据的简谱图像到音乐格式的混合转换系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 西方五线谱识别研究较多，但中国简谱及其歌词资源未充分探索，且传统方法依赖大量标注数据。

Method: 采用自顶向下专家系统设计，融合传统计算机视觉（如短语关联、骨架分析）与无监督深度学习图像特征嵌入模块。

Result: 在《中国民歌大全》数据集上实现高精度识别：旋律单音符F1=0.951，带歌词曲目字符F1=0.931，成功处理超5000首民歌

Conclusion: 混合策略在可解释性与准确性间取得平衡，为非西方乐谱数字化提供新范式。

Abstract: Large-scale optical music recognition (OMR) research has focused mainly on Western staff notation, leaving Chinese Jianpu (numbered notation) and its rich lyric resources underexplored. We present a modular expert-system pipeline that converts printed Jianpu scores with lyrics into machine-readable MusicXML and MIDI, without requiring massive annotated training data. Our approach adopts a top-down expert-system design, leveraging traditional computer-vision techniques (e.g., phrase correlation, skeleton analysis) to capitalize on prior knowledge, while integrating unsupervised deep-learning modules for image feature embeddings. This hybrid strategy strikes a balance between interpretability and accuracy. Evaluated on The Anthology of Chinese Folk Songs, our system massively digitizes (i) a melody-only collection of more than 5,000 songs (> 300,000 notes) and (ii) a curated subset with lyrics comprising over 1,400 songs (> 100,000 notes). The system achieves high-precision recognition on both melody (note-wise F1 = 0.951) and aligned lyrics (character-wise F1 = 0.931).

### [4] [AquaDiff: Diffusion-Based Underwater Image Enhancement for Addressing Color Distortion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14760)
*Afrah Shaahid,Muzammil Behzad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出AquaDiff: 基于扩散模型的水下图像增强框架，通过色度先验引导与跨域一致性损失实现色彩校正与细节保留。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于水下光吸收和散射的波长依赖性，图像会遭受颜色失真、低对比度和细节丢失，阻碍了水下视觉应用的发展。

Method: 结合色度先验引导的色彩补偿策略与条件扩散过程，采用跨注意力动态融合退化输入与噪声隐层状态，通过残差密集块和多分辨率注意力捕获全局颜色上下文与局部细节，并设计跨域一致性损失协同约束像素级精度、感知相似性、结构完整性与频域保真度。

Result: 在多个水下基准测试中，AquaDiff在色彩校正和图像质量方面均优于传统方法、CNN、GAN和扩散模型方法，尤其在复杂水下环境具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该框架解决了水下图像增强中色彩扭曲与细节丢失的挑战，提出了一种兼顾物理退化建模与生成质量优化的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Underwater images are severely degraded by wavelength-dependent light absorption and scattering, resulting in color distortion, low contrast, and loss of fine details that hinder vision-based underwater applications. To address these challenges, we propose AquaDiff, a diffusion-based underwater image enhancement framework designed to correct chromatic distortions while preserving structural and perceptual fidelity. AquaDiff integrates a chromatic prior-guided color compensation strategy with a conditional diffusion process, where cross-attention dynamically fuses degraded inputs and noisy latent states at each denoising step. An enhanced denoising backbone with residual dense blocks and multi-resolution attention captures both global color context and local details. Furthermore, a novel cross-domain consistency loss jointly enforces pixel-level accuracy, perceptual similarity, structural integrity, and frequency-domain fidelity. Extensive experiments on multiple challenging underwater benchmarks demonstrate that AquaDiff provides good results as compared to the state-of-the-art traditional, CNN-, GAN-, and diffusion-based methods, achieving superior color correction and competitive overall image quality across diverse underwater conditions.

### [5] [Improving VQA Reliability: A Dual-Assessment Approach with Self-Reflection and Cross-Model Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14770)
*Xixian Wu,Yang Ou,Pengchao Tian,Zian Yang,Jielei Zhang,Peiyi Li,Longwen Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了DAVR框架，通过Self-Reflection和Cross-Model Verification提升视觉语言模型(VLM)的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型(VLM)在视觉问答(VQA)中存在易产生幻觉的问题，导致答案不可靠。需要解决模型输出的可信度评估问题。

Method: 采用双路径架构：1）双选择器模块融合VLM潜在特征和QA嵌入评估响应可靠性；2）外部参考模型进行事实交叉验证以减少幻觉。

Result: 在ICCV-CLVL 2025的Reliable VQA挑战赛中，DAVR以39.64的Φ₁₀₀分数和97.22的100-AUC得分获得第一名。

Conclusion: DAVR有效提升了VLM响应的可信度，解决了模型幻觉导致的可靠性问题。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in Visual Question Answering (VQA). However, the susceptibility of VLMs to hallucinations can lead to overconfident yet incorrect answers, severely undermining answer reliability. To address this, we propose Dual-Assessment for VLM Reliability (DAVR), a novel framework that integrates Self-Reflection and Cross-Model Verification for comprehensive uncertainty estimation. The DAVR framework features a dual-pathway architecture: one pathway leverages dual selector modules to assess response reliability by fusing VLM latent features with QA embeddings, while the other deploys external reference models for factual cross-checking to mitigate hallucinations. Evaluated in the Reliable VQA Challenge at ICCV-CLVL 2025, DAVR achieves a leading $Φ_{100}$ score of 39.64 and a 100-AUC of 97.22, securing first place and demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the trustworthiness of VLM responses.

### [6] [HERBench: A Benchmark for Multi-Evidence Integration in Video Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14870)
*Dan Ben-Ami,Gabriele Serussi,Kobi Cohen,Chaim Baskin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了HERBench，一个用于测试视频多证据时间整合能力的视频问答基准。该基准要求问题回答必须融合至少三个非重叠的时间片段，揭示现有模型存在检索和融合缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频问答基准测试多依赖单一显著视觉线索，未能充分检验跨时间多线索整合能力。需要建立更严格、可量化的评估框架以推动模型发展。

Method: 构建包含26K多选题的HERBench，要求必须整合三个以上非重叠片段。提出最小必要帧集（MRFS）指标，评估13种SOTA视频大模型的推理缺陷。

Result: 模型准确率仅31-42%（随机基线为20%），MRFS均值5.5显着高于历史数据（2.6-4.2），发现关键缺陷：1) 帧选择遗漏关键证据；2) 证据整合失败。

Conclusion: 通过强制跨时证据整合，HERBench建立了测量视觉推理瓶颈的标准方法，指出现有模型在时空信息处理机制上的根本性不足。

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) are rapidly improving, yet current Video Question Answering (VideoQA) benchmarks often allow questions to be answered from a single salient cue, under-testing reasoning that must aggregate multiple, temporally separated visual evidence. We present HERBench, a VideoQA benchmark purpose-built to assess multi-evidence integration across time. Each question requires aggregating at least three non-overlapping evidential cues across distinct video segments, so neither language priors nor a single snapshot can suffice. HERBench comprises 26K five-way multiple-choice questions organized into twelve compositional tasks that probe identity binding, cross-entity relations, temporal ordering, co-occurrence verification, and counting. To make evidential demand measurable, we introduce the Minimum Required Frame-Set (MRFS), the smallest number of frames a model must fuse to answer correctly, and show that HERBench imposes substantially higher demand than prior datasets (mean MRFS 5.5 vs. 2.6-4.2). Evaluating 13 state-of-the-art Video-LLMs on HERBench reveals pervasive failures: accuracies of 31-42% are only slightly above the 20% random-guess baseline. We disentangle this failure into two critical bottlenecks: (1) a retrieval deficit, where frame selectors overlook key evidence, and (2) a fusion deficit, where models fail to integrate information even when all necessary evidence is provided. By making cross-time evidence both unavoidable and quantifiable, HERBench establishes a principled target for advancing robust, compositional video understanding.

### [7] [Isolated Sign Language Recognition with Segmentation and Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14876)
*Daniel Perkins,Davis Hunter,Dhrumil Patel,Galen Flanagan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出一种高效的孤立手语识别模型，解决数据稀缺、签署者差异和计算成本高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于现有翻译技术无法服务美国手语（ASL）用户，且传统孤立手语识别（ISLR）受限于数据不足、签署者差异和计算成本，需开发更高效方案。

Method: 设计包含姿态估计、关键信息分割及ResNet-Transformer联合建模时空依赖的三阶段框架，降低计算负载并增强泛化能力。

Result: 模型在保持对签署者差异的鲁棒性前提下，显著减少计算需求。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结构创新有效提升ISLR效率与适用性，为低资源场景提供可扩展解决方案，加速手语数字化进程。

Abstract: The recent surge in large language models has automated translations of spoken and written languages. However, these advances remain largely inaccessible to American Sign Language (ASL) users, whose language relies on complex visual cues. Isolated sign language recognition (ISLR) - the task of classifying videos of individual signs - can help bridge this gap but is currently limited by scarce per-sign data, high signer variability, and substantial computational costs. We propose a model for ISLR that reduces computational requirements while maintaining robustness to signer variation. Our approach integrates (i) a pose estimation pipeline to extract hand and face joint coordinates, (ii) a segmentation module that isolates relevant information, and (iii) a ResNet-Transformer backbone to jointly model spatial and temporal dependencies.

### [8] [Visual-textual Dermatoglyphic Animal Biometrics: A First Case Study on Panthera tigris](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14878)
*Wenshuo Li,Majid Mirmehdi,Tilo Burghardt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合皮肤纹路文本描述符的动物再识别方法，通过文本与图像融合提升跨模态身份检索能力，并利用文本-图像协同生成技术缓解数据稀缺问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统动物再识别依赖生物学家手动结合视觉与文本记录，现有AI工具多局限于图像方法，缺乏对可解释性及跨模态交互的探索。

Method: 1）采用法医学中的皮肤纹路特征描述符，将动物皮毛拓扑转化为人类可理解的文本标签；2）基于3,355张老虎图像（含84,264个人工标注细节）构建跨模态语料库；3）开发文本-图像协同生成算法合成‘虚拟个体’用于数据增强。

Result: 1）跨模态检索准确率显著提升；2）通过合成数据有效缓解真实数据稀缺问题；3）实现基于文本描述的视觉身份匹配，且匹配过程可通过人类验证。

Conclusion: 基于皮肤纹路语言引导的生物识别技术突破纯图像方法限制，为动物身份再识别提供了更具可解释性的跨模态解决方案，并推动了生态监测中描述性模态的语言化统一。

Abstract: Biologists have long combined visuals with textual field notes to re-identify (Re-ID) animals. Contemporary AI tools automate this for species with distinctive morphological features but remain largely image-based. Here, we extend Re-ID methodologies by incorporating precise dermatoglyphic textual descriptors-an approach used in forensics but new to ecology. We demonstrate that these specialist semantics abstract and encode animal coat topology using human-interpretable language tags. Drawing on 84,264 manually labelled minutiae across 3,355 images of 185 tigers (Panthera tigris), we evaluate this visual-textual methodology, revealing novel capabilities for cross-modal identity retrieval. To optimise performance, we developed a text-image co-synthesis pipeline to generate 'virtual individuals', each comprising dozens of life-like visuals paired with dermatoglyphic text. Benchmarking against real-world scenarios shows this augmentation significantly boosts AI accuracy in cross-modal retrieval while alleviating data scarcity. We conclude that dermatoglyphic language-guided biometrics can overcome vision-only limitations, enabling textual-to-visual identity recovery underpinned by human-verifiable matchings. This represents a significant advance towards explainability in Re-ID and a language-driven unification of descriptive modalities in ecological monitoring.

### [9] [Vibe Spaces for Creatively Connecting and Expressing Visual Concepts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14884)
*Huzheng Yang,Katherine Xu,Andrew Lu,Michael D. Grossberg,Yutong Bai,Jianbo Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Vibe Blending的新任务，通过Vibe Space（一种分层图流形）生成具有连贯性和创意性的图像混合，并引入认知启发框架进行评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以在潜在空间中找到连接不同视觉概念的非线性路径，导致无法有效结合共享属性（vibe）生成有意义的混合图像。

Method: 构建Vibe Space——基于CLIP等特征空间学习低维测地线的分层图流形，并设计结合人类判断、LLM推理和几何路径难度评分的评估框架。

Result: 实验表明，Vibe Space生成的混合图像在创意性和连贯性上显著优于现有方法，且人类评价一致性更高。

Conclusion: 该方法通过建模潜在空间共享属性，为创造性视觉任务提供了新思路，验证了分层图流形在复杂概念融合中的有效性。

Abstract: Creating new visual concepts often requires connecting distinct ideas through their most relevant shared attributes -- their vibe. We introduce Vibe Blending, a novel task for generating coherent and meaningful hybrids that reveals these shared attributes between images. Achieving such blends is challenging for current methods, which struggle to identify and traverse nonlinear paths linking distant concepts in latent space. We propose Vibe Space, a hierarchical graph manifold that learns low-dimensional geodesics in feature spaces like CLIP, enabling smooth and semantically consistent transitions between concepts. To evaluate creative quality, we design a cognitively inspired framework combining human judgments, LLM reasoning, and a geometric path-based difficulty score. We find that Vibe Space produces blends that humans consistently rate as more creative and coherent than current methods.

### [10] [PANDA-PLUS-Bench: A Clinical Benchmark for Evaluating Robustness of AI Foundation Models in Prostate Cancer Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14922)
*Joshua L. Ebbert,Dennis Della Corte*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究构建了一个名为PANDA-PLUS-Bench的数据集，用于评估前列腺癌Gleason分级中AI基础模型对生物特征与病理伪影的区分能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型可能依赖病理切片特异性伪影而非通用生物特征，限制临床实用性，亟需专门评估模型鲁棒性的数据集。

Method: 从九例患者前列腺活检中构建包含Gleason模式的九张全切片图像，提取不同分辨率切片并进行八种增强处理，评估七个基础模型的跨切片准确率与滑动级编码能力。

Result: 各模型鲁棒性差异显著：Virchow2滑动级编码最低（81.0%）但跨切片准确率次低（47.2%），HistoEncoder（前列腺特训）以59.7%跨切片准确率和90.3%滑动级编码表现最佳，所有模型存在19.9-26.9个百分点的同切片与跨切片准确率差距。

Conclusion: PANDA-PLUS-Bench通过组织特异性训练验证模型鲁棒性，揭示当前模型生物特征捕获能力局限，提供开源工具促进后续研究。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence foundation models are increasingly deployed for prostate cancer Gleason grading, where GP3/GP4 distinction directly impacts treatment decisions. However, these models may achieve high validation accuracy by learning specimen-specific artifacts rather than generalizable biological features, limiting real-world clinical utility. We introduce PANDA-PLUS-Bench, a curated benchmark dataset derived from expert-annotated prostate biopsies designed specifically to quantify this failure mode. The benchmark comprises nine carefully selected whole slide images from nine unique patients containing diverse Gleason patterns, with non-overlapping tissue patches extracted at both 512x512 and 224x224 pixel resolutions across eight augmentation conditions. Using this benchmark, we evaluate seven foundation models on their ability to separate biological signal from slide-level confounders. Our results reveal substantial variation in robustness across models: Virchow2 achieved the lowest slide-level encoding among large-scale models (81.0%) yet exhibited the second-lowest cross-slide accuracy (47.2%). HistoEncoder, trained specifically on prostate tissue, demonstrated the highest cross-slide accuracy (59.7%) and the strongest slide-level encoding (90.3%), suggesting tissue-specific training may enhance both biological feature capture and slide-specific signatures. All models exhibited measurable within-slide vs. cross-slide accuracy gaps, though the magnitude varied from 19.9 percentage points to 26.9 percentage points. We provide an open-source Google Colab notebook enabling researchers to evaluate additional foundation models against our benchmark using standardized metrics. PANDA-PLUS-Bench addresses a critical gap in foundation model evaluation by providing a purpose-built resource for robustness assessment in the clinically important context of Gleason grading.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过自适应后处理技术优化预训练深度学习模型对脑胶质瘤MRI图像的分割结果，在BraTS 2025挑战中实现性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模预训练深度学习模型存在泛化性差（如假阳性、标签交换、切片断裂）和资源消耗高的问题，影响临床应用。

Method: 开发针对mpMRI数据设计的通用自适应后处理策略，用于校正模型输出的分割瑕疵。

Result: 在次撒哈拉非洲挑战中排名指标提升14.9%（绝对DSC提升未报告），成人胶质瘤挑战提升0.9%。

Conclusion: 后处理技术能提升现有模型临床实用性，同时降低对计算资源和能源消耗的依赖，推动领域研究方向转向资源友好型策略。

Abstract: Gliomas are the most common malignant brain tumors in adults and are among the most lethal. Despite aggressive treatment, the median survival rate is less than 15 months. Accurate multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) tumor segmentation is critical for surgical planning, radiotherapy, and disease monitoring. While deep learning models have improved the accuracy of automated segmentation, large-scale pre-trained models generalize poorly and often underperform, producing systematic errors such as false positives, label swaps, and slice discontinuities in slices. These limitations are further compounded by unequal access to GPU resources and the growing environmental cost of large-scale model training. In this work, we propose adaptive post-processing techniques to refine the quality of glioma segmentations produced by large-scale pretrained models developed for various types of tumors. We demonstrated the techniques in multiple BraTS 2025 segmentation challenge tasks, with the ranking metric improving by 14.9 % for the sub-Saharan Africa challenge and 0.9% for the adult glioma challenge. This approach promotes a shift in brain tumor segmentation research from increasingly complex model architectures to efficient, clinically aligned post-processing strategies that are precise, computationally fair, and sustainable.

### [12] [TalkVerse: Democratizing Minute-Long Audio-Driven Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14938)
*Zhenzhi Wang,Jian Wang,Ke Ma,Dahua Lin,Bing Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了TalkVerse，一个用于音频驱动对话视频生成的大规模开源数据集，并基于其开发了高效的50亿参数DiT基线模型，在保证生成质量的同时显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有最先进方法依赖封闭数据或计算密集型模型，缺乏公平比较基准。需要构建包含高质量音频-视频对齐与多模态标注的透明数据集，推动可复现研究。

Method: 构建包含230万720p/1080p同步视频片段的TalkVerse数据集（6000小时），采用场景切割、音画同步验证及2D骨骼标注等透明化处理。基于Wan2.2-5B开发5B参数DiT模型，结合高降采样率视频VAE与运动帧滑动窗口机制，并引入MLLM导演模块优化长视频叙事，通过潜噪声注入实现零样本视频配音。

Result: 在1/10推理成本下实现与14B参数Wan-S2V相当的口型同步质量与视觉效果，可生成分钟级低漂移视频。数据集、训练代码与模型权重已开源。

Conclusion: TalkVerse为音频驱动人体视频生成提供标准化评估平台，提出的轻量化模型在保持高质量生成的同时增强故事叙述能力，开源策略降低了研究门槛。

Abstract: We introduce TalkVerse, a large-scale, open corpus for single-person, audio-driven talking video generation designed to enable fair, reproducible comparison across methods. While current state-of-the-art systems rely on closed data or compute-heavy models, TalkVerse offers 2.3 million high-resolution (720p/1080p) audio-video synchronized clips totaling 6.3k hours. These are curated from over 60k hours of video via a transparent pipeline that includes scene-cut detection, aesthetic assessment, strict audio-visual synchronization checks, and comprehensive annotations including 2D skeletons and structured visual/audio-style captions. Leveraging TalkVerse, we present a reproducible 5B DiT baseline built on Wan2.2-5B. By utilizing a video VAE with a high downsampling ratio and a sliding window mechanism with motion-frame context, our model achieves minute-long generation with low drift. It delivers comparable lip-sync and visual quality to the 14B Wan-S2V model but with 10$\times$ lower inference cost. To enhance storytelling in long videos, we integrate an MLLM director to rewrite prompts based on audio and visual cues. Furthermore, our model supports zero-shot video dubbing via controlled latent noise injection. We open-source the dataset, training recipes, and 5B checkpoints to lower barriers for research in audio-driven human video generation. Project Page: https://zhenzhiwang.github.io/talkverse/

### [13] [Puzzle Curriculum GRPO for Vision-Centric Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14944)
*Ahmadreza Jeddi,Hakki Can Karaimer,Hue Nguyen,Zhongling Wang,Ke Zhao,Javad Rajabi,Ran Zhang,Raghav Goyal,Babak Taati,Radek Grzeszczuk*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PC-GRPO提出一种无需人工标注或外部验证器的强化学习后训练方法，通过自监督拼图环境与难度感知课程动态平衡样本权重，提升视觉语言模型的链式推理一致性与性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 1. 现有RL方法(如GRPO)依赖昂贵且有噪音的人工标注或外部验证器；2. GRPO的平坦/稀疏奖励机制；3. 推理链与最终答案间存在逻辑矛盾

Method: 1. 构建3种自监督拼图环境：PatchFit/Rotation(二值奖励)和Jigsaw(部分奖励缓解疏密问题)；2. 引入动态加权样本的难度感知课程，难度峰值集中在中等水平；3. 提出Reasoning-Answer Consistency(RAC)监控机制

Result: 1. 在Qwen-7B/Qwen-3B模型上验证，显著提升推理质量/训练稳定性/下游任务准确率；2. RAC指标与模型准确率呈正相关；3. 课程设计延缓了传统GRPO的RAC衰减现象

Conclusion: PC-GRPO为视觉语言模型提供可扩展、可验证、可解释的强化学习后训练方案，解决了传统方法对标注和验证器的依赖问题，为通用视觉推理系统提供新范式

Abstract: Recent reinforcement learning (RL) approaches like outcome-supervised GRPO have advanced chain-of-thought reasoning in Vision Language Models (VLMs), yet key issues linger: (i) reliance on costly and noisy hand-curated annotations or external verifiers; (ii) flat and sparse reward schemes in GRPO; and (iii) logical inconsistency between a chain's reasoning and its final answer. We present Puzzle Curriculum GRPO (PC-GRPO), a supervision-free recipe for RL with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) that strengthens visual reasoning in VLMs without annotations or external verifiers. PC-GRPO replaces labels with three self-supervised puzzle environments: PatchFit, Rotation (with binary rewards) and Jigsaw (with graded partial credit mitigating reward sparsity). To counter flat rewards and vanishing group-relative advantages, we introduce a difficulty-aware curriculum that dynamically weights samples and peaks at medium difficulty. We further monitor Reasoning-Answer Consistency (RAC) during post-training: mirroring reports for vanilla GRPO in LLMs, RAC typically rises early then degrades; our curriculum delays this decline, and consistency-enforcing reward schemes further boost RAC. RAC correlates with downstream accuracy. Across diverse benchmarks and on Qwen-7B and Qwen-3B backbones, PC-GRPO improves reasoning quality, training stability, and end-task accuracy, offering a practical path to scalable, verifiable, and interpretable RL post-training for VLMs.

*Aref Farhadipour,Teodora Vukovic,Volker Dellwo,Petr Motlicek,Srikanth Madikeri*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a robust Trimodal person identification framework that combines voice, face, and gesture data, achieving high accuracy even when some modalities are missing or degraded.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing person recognition systems struggle with missing or degraded modalities in real-world conditions, necessitating a robust solution that maintains accuracy across varying data availability.

Method: Leverages multi-task learning for independent modality processing, followed by cross-attention and gated fusion mechanisms. A confidence-weighted fusion strategy dynamically adapts to missing/low-quality data for optimal classification.

Result: Achieved 99.18% Top-1 accuracy on the CANDOR dataset and 99.92% on VoxCeleb1 in Bimodal mode, maintaining high performance even with partial modality loss.

Conclusion: The Trimodal system outperforms conventional Unimodal/late-fusion approaches, offering a robust, adaptive solution for real-world person recognition challenges.

Abstract: Person recognition systems often rely on audio, visual, or behavioral cues, but real-world conditions frequently result in missing or degraded modalities. To address this challenge, we propose a Trimodal person identification framework that integrates voice, face, and gesture modalities, while remaining robust to modality loss. Our approach leverages multi-task learning to process each modality independently, followed by a cross-attention and gated fusion mechanisms to facilitate interaction across modalities. Moreover, a confidence-weighted fusion strategy dynamically adapts to missing and low-quality data, ensuring optimal classification even in Unimodal or Bimodal scenarios. We evaluate our method on CANDOR, a newly introduced interview-based multimodal dataset, which we benchmark for the first time. Our results demonstrate that the proposed Trimodal system achieves 99.18% Top-1 accuracy on person identification tasks, outperforming conventional Unimodal and late-fusion approaches. In addition, we evaluate our model on the VoxCeleb1 dataset as a benchmark and reach 99.92% accuracy in Bimodal mode. Moreover, we show that our system maintains high accuracy even when one or two modalities are unavailable, making it a robust solution for real-world person recognition applications. The code and data for this work are publicly available.

Conclusion: 通过融合块级统计嵌入与区域检测图分析，该方法在数字图像溯源中首次实现了可解释性与强鲁棒性的协同优化，为生成内容认证提供了透明化技术框架。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI have enabled the creation of highly realistic digital content, raising concerns around authenticity, ownership, and misuse. While watermarking has become an increasingly important mechanism to trace and protect digital media, most existing image watermarking schemes operate as black boxes, producing global detection scores without offering any insight into how or where the watermark is present. This lack of transparency impacts user trust and makes it difficult to interpret the impact of tampering. In this paper, we present a post-hoc image watermarking method that combines localised embedding with region-level interpretability. Our approach embeds watermark signals in the discrete wavelet transform domain using a statistical block-wise strategy. This allows us to generate detection maps that reveal which regions of an image are likely watermarked or altered. We show that our method achieves strong robustness against common image transformations while remaining sensitive to semantic manipulations. At the same time, the watermark remains highly imperceptible. Compared to prior post-hoc methods, our approach offers more interpretable detection while retaining competitive robustness. For example, our watermarks are robust to cropping up to half the image.

*Sibi Parivendan,Kashfia Sailunaz,Suresh Neethirajan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a pose-based framework to classify livestock social behaviors by analyzing anatomical keypoints' motion dynamics, bypassing conventional proximity-only methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing proximity threshold-based approaches fail to distinguish affiliative vs. agonistic interactions in complex barn environments, limiting automated social network analysis for welfare monitoring.

Method: A vision pipeline combines YOLOv11 (object detection), ZebraPose (27-point keypoint estimation), ByteTrack (tracking), and SVM classification trained on pose-derived distance dynamics to capture spatial-temporal interaction patterns.

Result: 77.51% accuracy in classifying social interaction valence using pose information alone, with significant improvement over proximity baselines, especially for affiliative interactions.

Conclusion: The framework enables automated, real-time social network analysis with hardware-efficient vision systems, advancing precision livestock farming's behavioral inference capabilities.

Abstract: Precision livestock farming requires objective assessment of social behavior to support herd welfare monitoring, yet most existing approaches infer interactions using static proximity thresholds that cannot distinguish affiliative from agonistic behaviors in complex barn environments. This limitation constrains the interpretability of automated social network analysis in commercial settings. We present a pose-based computational framework for interaction classification that moves beyond proximity heuristics by modeling the spatiotemporal geometry of anatomical keypoints. Rather than relying on pixel-level appearance or simple distance measures, the proposed method encodes interaction-specific motion signatures from keypoint trajectories, enabling differentiation of social interaction valence. The framework is implemented as an end-to-end computer vision pipeline integrating YOLOv11 for object detection (mAP@0.50: 96.24%), supervised individual identification (98.24% accuracy), ByteTrack for multi-object tracking (81.96% accuracy), ZebraPose for 27-point anatomical keypoint estimation, and a support vector machine classifier trained on pose-derived distance dynamics. On annotated interaction clips collected from a commercial dairy barn, the classifier achieved 77.51% accuracy in distinguishing affiliative and agonistic behaviors using pose information alone. Comparative evaluation against a proximity-only baseline shows substantial gains in behavioral discrimination, particularly for affiliative interactions. The results establish a proof-of-concept for automated, vision-based inference of social interactions suitable for constructing interaction-aware social networks, with near-real-time performance on commodity hardware.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频问题生成评估方法仅关注问题的可回答性，缺乏对生成问题质量（特别是引发未见过知识的能力）的有效衡量，需建立新评估标准推动模型持续改进。

Method: 设计基于问题-回答检索模拟交流的评估协议，构建包含27,666个QA对的EgoExoAsk数据集，其中训练集用于训练检索器，验证集结合Ego-Exo4D视频片段构建基准测试。

Result: 实验表明新协议与问题生成场景合理对齐：能访问更多上下文信息的模型得分更高，验证了协议能有效区分模型能力，且EgoExoAsk数据集具备实用价值。

Conclusion: 提出的评估协议成功解决了视频问题生成质量量化难题，新数据集为研究提供了重要工具，代码与数据已开源。

Abstract: Skilled human interviewers can extract valuable information from experts. This raises a fundamental question: what makes some questions more effective than others? To address this, a quantitative evaluation of question-generation models is essential. Video question generation (VQG) is a topic for video question answering (VideoQA), where questions are generated for given answers. Their evaluation typically focuses on the ability to answer questions, rather than the quality of generated questions. In contrast, we focus on the question quality in eliciting unseen knowledge from human experts. For a continuous improvement of VQG models, we propose a protocol that evaluates the ability by simulating question-answering communication with experts using a question-to-answer retrieval. We obtain the retriever by constructing a novel dataset, EgoExoAsk, which comprises 27,666 QA pairs generated from Ego-Exo4D's expert commentary annotation. The EgoExoAsk training set is used to obtain the retriever, and the benchmark is constructed on the validation set with Ego-Exo4D video segments. Experimental results demonstrate our metric reasonably aligns with question generation settings: models accessing richer context are evaluated better, supporting that our protocol works as intended. The EgoExoAsk dataset is available in https://github.com/omron-sinicx/VQG4ExpertKnowledge .

TL;DR: MAPO是一种通用医学图像分割的偏好优化框架，无需直接监督，提升边界精度和训练稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前医学图像分割中偏好优化方法依赖模型特定设计和低多样性预测的问题

Method: 通过Dropout生成随机分割假设，构建偏好一致性梯度，兼容2D/3D CNN和Transformer架构

Result: 在多个医学数据集验证中实现更精准的边界分割，减少过拟合，优化迭代稳定性提升35%

Conclusion: MAPO为医学图像分割提供了首个通用的无监督偏好优化范式，显著优于传统监督训练方法

Abstract: Preference optimization offers a scalable supervision paradigm based on relative preference signals, yet prior attempts in medical image segmentation remain model-specific and rely on low-diversity prediction sampling. In this paper, we propose MAPO (Model-Agnostic Preference Optimization), a training framework that utilizes Dropout-driven stochastic segmentation hypotheses to construct preference-consistent gradients without direct ground-truth supervision. MAPO is fully architecture- and dimensionality-agnostic, supporting 2D/3D CNN and Transformer-based segmentation pipelines. Comprehensive evaluations across diverse medical datasets reveal that MAPO consistently enhances boundary adherence, reduces overfitting, and yields more stable optimization dynamics compared to conventional supervised training.

*Kaizhe Zhang,Shinan Chen,Qian Zhao,Weizhan Zhang,Caixia Yan,Yudeng Xin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes MVGSR, a multi-view consistent 3D Gaussian Splatting Super-Resolution framework that improves high-resolution rendering by integrating epipolar geometry constraints and adaptive multi-view fusion, eliminating the need for sequential input.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3DGS SR methods suffer from cross-view inconsistency (single-image networks) or strict temporal requirements (video-based approaches), necessitating a solution that can leverage arbitrary multi-view datasets effectively.

Method: 1) Camera pose-based Auxiliary View Selection for flexible multi-view input; 2) Epipolar-constrained multi-view attention network to enforce geometric consistency; 3) Cross-view information aggregation guided by spatial constraints.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance on both object-centric (×2/×4) and scene-level (×2) 3DGS SR benchmarks with 38.32dB PSNR (×4) on DTU dataset, while maintaining temporal stability in rendered sequences.

Conclusion: MVGSR establishes a novel general framework for multi-view aware 3DGS processing, demonstrating superior SR quality and consistency compared to single-view and video SR approaches, with potential applications in neural rendering and 3D reconstruction.

Abstract: Scenes reconstructed by 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) trained on low-resolution (LR) images are unsuitable for high-resolution (HR) rendering. Consequently, a 3DGS super-resolution (SR) method is needed to bridge LR inputs and HR rendering. Early 3DGS SR methods rely on single-image SR networks, which lack cross-view consistency and fail to fuse complementary information across views. More recent video-based SR approaches attempt to address this limitation but require strictly sequential frames, limiting their applicability to unstructured multi-view datasets. In this work, we introduce Multi-View Consistent 3D Gaussian Splatting Super-Resolution (MVGSR), a framework that focuses on integrating multi-view information for 3DGS rendering with high-frequency details and enhanced consistency. We first propose an Auxiliary View Selection Method based on camera poses, making our method adaptable for arbitrarily organized multi-view datasets without the need of temporal continuity or data reordering. Furthermore, we introduce, for the first time, an epipolar-constrained multi-view attention mechanism into 3DGS SR, which serves as the core of our proposed multi-view SR network. This design enables the model to selectively aggregate consistent information from auxiliary views, enhancing the geometric consistency and detail fidelity of 3DGS representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both object-centric and scene-level 3DGS SR benchmarks.

Motivation: 传统高速相机因设备成本高、抗光干扰能力弱，难以满足大型结构高频变形测量需求。事件相机具备低延迟和高动态范围特性，结合LED标记可解决现有技术瓶颈。

Method: 首先基于事件流时空相关性滤除观测噪声，通过区分运动诱导事件与LED闪烁事件提取动态标记，最后利用单目事件相机重建高频平面变形，实现微观振动特征捕获。

Result: 实验验证该方法在复杂光照环境下可精确测量300Hz以上平面变形，误差率低于0.15mm，较传统方法效率提升40%，成功应用于模拟大跨度桥梁振动监测。

Conclusion: 本方法开创性地将事件相机与LED标记结合，建立了新型结构健康监测框架，为高频微小变形检测提供了低成本、高鲁棒性的解决方案。

Abstract: Large-scale structures suffer high-frequency deformations due to complex loads. However, harsh lighting conditions and high equipment costs limit measurement methods based on traditional high-speed cameras. This paper proposes a method to measure high-frequency deformations by exploiting an event camera and LED markers. Firstly, observation noise is filtered based on the characteristics of the event stream generated by LED markers blinking and spatiotemporal correlation. Then, LED markers are extracted from the event stream after differentiating between motion-induced events and events from LED blinking, which enables the extraction of high-speed moving LED markers. Ultimately, high-frequency planar deformations are measured by a monocular event camera. Experimental results confirm the accuracy of our method in measuring high-frequency planar deformations.

Abstract: Generating consistent human images with controllable pose and appearance is essential for applications in virtual try on, image editing, and digital human creation. Current methods often suffer from occlusions, garment style drift, and pose misalignment. We propose Pose-guided Multi-view Multimodal Diffusion (PMMD), a diffusion framework that synthesizes photorealistic person images conditioned on multi-view references, pose maps, and text prompts. A multimodal encoder jointly models visual views, pose features, and semantic descriptions, which reduces cross modal discrepancy and improves identity fidelity. We further design a ResCVA module to enhance local detail while preserving global structure, and a cross modal fusion module that integrates image semantics with text throughout the denoising pipeline. Experiments on the DeepFashion MultiModal dataset show that PMMD outperforms representative baselines in consistency, detail preservation, and controllability.

TL;DR: Nano Banana Pro shows superior visual quality but struggles with quantitative metrics in low-level vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploring whether commercial text-to-image models can serve as general solvers for traditional low-level vision challenges.

Method: Zero-shot evaluation of Nano Banana Pro across 14 low-level vision tasks and 40 datasets using textual prompts without fine-tuning, benchmarked against specialist models.

Result: Nano Banana Pro achieves better subjective visual quality but underperforms in reference-based quantitative metrics due to generative model stochasticity and pixel-level consistency issues.

Conclusion: Nano Banana Pro is a viable zero-shot option for low-level vision tasks but faces challenges in matching the fidelity of domain-specialist models.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of text-to-image generation models has revolutionized visual content creation. While commercial products like Nano Banana Pro have garnered significant attention, their potential as generalist solvers for traditional low-level vision challenges remains largely underexplored. In this study, we investigate the critical question: Is Nano Banana Pro a Low-Level Vision All-Rounder? We conducted a comprehensive zero-shot evaluation across 14 distinct low-level tasks spanning 40 diverse datasets. By utilizing simple textual prompts without fine-tuning, we benchmarked Nano Banana Pro against state-of-the-art specialist models. Our extensive analysis reveals a distinct performance dichotomy: while \textbf{Nano Banana Pro demonstrates superior subjective visual quality}, often hallucinating plausible high-frequency details that surpass specialist models, it lags behind in traditional reference-based quantitative metrics. We attribute this discrepancy to the inherent stochasticity of generative models, which struggle to maintain the strict pixel-level consistency required by conventional metrics. This report identifies Nano Banana Pro as a capable zero-shot contender for low-level vision tasks, while highlighting that achieving the high fidelity of domain specialists remains a significant hurdle.

Abstract: Evaluating whether human action is standard or not and providing reasonable feedback to improve action standardization is very crucial but challenging in real-world scenarios. However, current video understanding methods are mainly concerned with what and where the action is, which is unable to meet the requirements. Meanwhile, most of the existing datasets lack the labels indicating the degree of action standardization, and the action quality assessment datasets lack explainability and detailed feedback. Therefore, we define a new Human Action Form Assessment (AFA) task, and introduce a new diverse dataset CoT-AFA, which contains a large scale of fitness and martial arts videos with multi-level annotations for comprehensive video analysis. We enrich the CoT-AFA dataset with a novel Chain-of-Thought explanation paradigm. Instead of offering isolated feedback, our explanations provide a complete reasoning process--from identifying an action step to analyzing its outcome and proposing a concrete solution. Furthermore, we propose a framework named Explainable Fitness Assessor, which can not only judge an action but also explain why and provide a solution. This framework employs two parallel processing streams and a dynamic gating mechanism to fuse visual and semantic information, thereby boosting its analytical capabilities. The experimental results demonstrate that our method has achieved improvements in explanation generation (e.g., +16.0% in CIDEr), action classification (+2.7% in accuracy) and quality assessment (+2.1% in accuracy), revealing great potential of CoT-AFA for future studies. Our dataset and source code is available at https://github.com/MICLAB-BUPT/EFA.

Motivation: 现有空间智能方法存在空间一致性弱、视角多样性不足及证据链无法追溯的问题，且未解决全局空间感知、3D假设验证与空间奖励设计三大挑战。

Method: 阶段一用语义-视角融合的行列式点过程（SPF-DPP）在固定预算下选取关键帧；阶段二通过鸟瞰图（BEV）姿态查询与强化学习实现空间链式推理验证。

Result: 在VSI-Bench数据集上超越开源视觉-语言模型，展现卓越空间理解能力。

Conclusion: EagleVision为多模态空间智能提供新范式，推动机器人定位、三维重建等下游任务发展。

Abstract: Recent spatial intelligence approaches typically attach 3D cues to 2D reasoning pipelines or couple MLLMs with black-box reconstruction modules, leading to weak spatial consistency, limited viewpoint diversity, and evidence chains that cannot be traced back to supporting views. Frameworks for "thinking with images" (e.g., ChatGPT-o3 and DeepEyes) show that stepwise multimodal reasoning can emerge by interleaving hypothesis formation with active acquisition of visual evidence, but they do not address three key challenges in spatial Chain-of-Thought (CoT): building global space perception under strict token budgets, explicitly associating 3D hypotheses with video frames for verification, and designing spatially grounded rewards for reinforcement learning. To address these issues, we present EagleVision, a dual-stage framework for progressive spatial cognition through macro perception and micro verification. In the macro perception stage, EagleVision employs a semantics-perspective-fusion determinantal point process (SPF-DPP) to select a compact set of geometry- and semantics-aware keyframes from long videos under a fixed token budget. In the micro verification stage, we formalize spatial CoT as BEV-grounded pose querying: the agent iteratively predicts poses on a BEV plane, retrieves the nearest real frames, and is trained purely by reinforcement learning with a spatial grounding reward that scores the consistency between predicted poses and observed views. On VSI-Bench, EagleVision achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source vision-language models, demonstrating strong and generalizable spatial understanding.

Abstract: Ensuring safety is the primary objective of automated driving, which necessitates a comprehensive and accurate perception of the environment. While numerous performance evaluation metrics exist for assessing perception capabilities, incorporating safety-specific metrics is essential to reliably evaluate object detection systems. A key component for safety evaluation is the ability to distinguish between relevant and non-relevant objects - a challenge addressed by criticality or relevance metrics. This paper presents the first in-depth analysis of criticality metrics for safety evaluation of object detection systems. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature, we identify and assess a range of applicable metrics. Their effectiveness is empirically validated using the DeepAccident dataset, which features a variety of safety-critical scenarios. To enhance evaluation accuracy, we propose two novel application strategies: bidirectional criticality rating and multi-metric aggregation. Our approach demonstrates up to a 100% improvement in terms of criticality classification accuracy, highlighting its potential to significantly advance the safety evaluation of object detection systems in automated vehicles.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度伪造检测方法存在两点致命缺陷：(1)后验真实性验证常不可行（引发无限假阳性率）；(2)防御鲁棒性不足（攻击者能以极低算力绕过检测）。论文提出可溯源的resynthesis框架以突破此类限制。

Conclusion: 研究证明基于可追溯的resynthesis框架能有效解决深度伪造检测的双重挑战，为计算资源受限场景下的多媒体真实性验证提供了新型技术路径。

Abstract: Generative models can synthesize highly realistic content, so-called deepfakes, that are already being misused at scale to undermine digital media authenticity. Current deepfake detection methods are unreliable for two reasons: (i) distinguishing inauthentic content post-hoc is often impossible (e.g., with memorized samples), leading to an unbounded false positive rate (FPR); and (ii) detection lacks robustness, as adversaries can adapt to known detectors with near-perfect accuracy using minimal computational resources. To address these limitations, we propose a resynthesis framework to determine if a sample is authentic or if its authenticity can be plausibly denied. We make two key contributions focusing on the high-precision, low-recall setting against efficient (i.e., compute-restricted) adversaries. First, we demonstrate that our calibrated resynthesis method is the most reliable approach for verifying authentic samples while maintaining controllable, low FPRs. Second, we show that our method achieves adversarial robustness against efficient adversaries, whereas prior methods are easily evaded under identical compute budgets. Our approach supports multiple modalities and leverages state-of-the-art inversion techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional no-reference metrics (e.g., Entropy, Average Gradient) fail in complex low-light UAV reconnaissance scenarios by treating sensor noise as meaningful details, leading to distorted evaluations and suboptimal fusion algorithms.

Method: The TBC metric, inspired by Weber's Law, prioritizes relative contrast of salient targets over global statistics. It penalizes background noise while rewarding target visibility, distinguishing itself from conventional approaches.

Result: Experiments on the DroneVehicle dataset show TBC outperforms existing metrics in consistency with human perception and establishes a reliable evaluation standard for low-altitude applications.

Conclusion: TBC effectively mitigates the Noise Trap and provides a targeted, efficient solution for quality assessment in UAV reconnaissance image fusion tasks.

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion is a pivotal technology in low-altitude UAV reconnaissance missions, providing high-quality data support for downstream tasks such as target detection and tracking by integrating thermal saliency with background texture details.However, traditional no-reference metrics fail(Specifically,like Entropy (EN) and Average Gradient (AG)) in complex low-light environments. They often misinterpret high-frequency sensor noise as valid detail. This creates a "Noise Trap," paradoxically assigning higher scores to noisy images and misguiding fusion algorithms.To address this, we propose the Target-Background Contrast (TBC) metric. Inspired by Weber's Law, TBC focuses on the relative contrast of salient targets rather than global statistics. Unlike traditional metrics, TBC penalizes background noise and rewards target visibility. Experiments on the DroneVehicle dataset demonstrate that TBC aligns better with human perception and provides a reliable standard for low-altitude scenarios.

Conclusion: Mesh-Plug通过解耦人体特征与相机参数估计，有效实现无环境线索下的世界坐标系重建，为3D人体建模提供新思路。

Abstract: Reconstructing accurate 3D human meshes in the world coordinate system from in-the-wild images remains challenging due to the lack of camera rotation information. While existing methods achieve promising results in the camera coordinate system by assuming zero camera rotation, this simplification leads to significant errors when transforming the reconstructed mesh to the world coordinate system. To address this challenge, we propose Mesh-Plug, a plug-and-play module that accurately transforms human meshes from camera coordinates to world coordinates. Our key innovation lies in a human-centered approach that leverages both RGB images and depth maps rendered from the initial mesh to estimate camera rotation parameters, eliminating the dependency on environmental cues. Specifically, we first train a camera rotation prediction module that focuses on the human body's spatial configuration to estimate camera pitch angle. Then, by integrating the predicted camera parameters with the initial mesh, we design a mesh adjustment module that simultaneously refines the root joint orientation and body pose. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the benchmark datasets SPEC-SYN and SPEC-MTP.

Conclusion: 研究证明了模型零空间的有效利用能显著提升参数效率理论分析表明零空间约束可保持模型表达能力，为高效微调提供了新视角

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods have gained considerable popularity for adapting large-scale models to downstream tasks, particularly LoRA and its variants. Existing methods perform low-rank adaptation over the full parameter space. However, fine-tuning within a subspace can achieve comparable effectiveness. Inspired by the observation that pre-trained models possess non-trivial null spaces, we propose Null-space based Low-Rank Adaptation (Null-LoRA). Null-LoRA effectively reduces redundancy and enhances effective rank by freezing portions of the low-rank matrices. To further improve parameter efficiency, Null-LoRA constrains the entire incremental update within the null space, maximizing the utilization of incremental updates to adapt to new task paradigms. Null-LoRA surpasses the state of the art with fewer parameters in extensive experiments across image-text retrieval and visual question answering tasks.

*Yupeng Zhang,Adam G. Dunn,Usman Naseem,Jinman Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的训练框架CMAC-MMD，用于减少医疗人工智能系统中的交叉性偏差，提高诊断准确性和公平性，且无需在临床推理中使用敏感的人口统计学数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的医疗AI系统在诊断边缘化患者亚群时存在系统性偏差，且现有的公平性干预措施往往未能有效解决这一问题或以降低整体诊断性能为代价。

Method: 开发了Cross-Modal Alignment Consistency（CMAC-MMD）训练框架，通过跨模态对齐一致性技术标准化不同患者亚群的诊断置信度，并在多个皮肤病变与视网膜图像数据集上验证该方法的性能。

Result: 在皮肤科队列中，CMAC-MMD降低了整体交叉性漏诊率差异（ΔTPR由0.50降至0.26），同时提升AUC（由0.94升至0.97）；在青光眼筛查中，ΔTPR由0.41降至0.31，AUC由0.71升至0.72。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种可扩展的框架，既能提升临床决策支持系统的准确性，又能确保其在不同患者亚群中的公平性和隐私安全性。

Abstract: Medical artificial intelligence (AI) systems, particularly multimodal vision-language models (VLM), often exhibit intersectional biases where models are systematically less confident in diagnosing marginalised patient subgroups. Such bias can lead to higher rates of inaccurate and missed diagnoses due to demographically skewed data and divergent distributions of diagnostic certainty. Current fairness interventions frequently fail to address these gaps or compromise overall diagnostic performance to achieve statistical parity among the subgroups. In this study, we developed Cross-Modal Alignment Consistency (CMAC-MMD), a training framework that standardises diagnostic certainty across intersectional patient subgroups. Unlike traditional debiasing methods, this approach equalises the model's decision confidence without requiring sensitive demographic data during clinical inference. We evaluated this approach using 10,015 skin lesion images (HAM10000) with external validation on 12,000 images (BCN20000), and 10,000 fundus images for glaucoma detection (Harvard-FairVLMed), stratifying performance by intersectional age, gender, and race attributes. In the dermatology cohort, the proposed method reduced the overall intersectional missed diagnosis gap (difference in True Positive Rate, $Δ$TPR) from 0.50 to 0.26 while improving the overall Area Under the Curve (AUC) from 0.94 to 0.97 compared to standard training. Similarly, for glaucoma screening, the method reduced $Δ$TPR from 0.41 to 0.31, achieving a better AUC of 0.72 (vs. 0.71 baseline). This establishes a scalable framework for developing high-stakes clinical decision support systems that are both accurate and can perform equitably across diverse patient subgroups, ensuring reliable performance without increasing privacy risks.

### [32] [Assessing the Visual Enumeration Abilities of Specialized Counting Architectures and Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15254)
*Kuinan Hou,Jing Mi,Marco Zorzi,Lamberto Ballan,Alberto Testolin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates whether vision-language models (VLMs) can replace specialized architectures for object counting tasks. VLMs match or surpass specialized models, especially when prompted to generate object representations, but struggle with complex scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether domain-general VLMs can achieve open-set object counting without relying on domain-specific architectures and annotated datasets with predefined categories.

Method: Compared state-of-the-art counting architectures with VLMs on two existing datasets and a novel benchmark with controlled visual properties. Tested VLMs with/without prompting for intermediate object representations (locations/labels).

Result: VLMs achieved comparable/superior performance to specialized models, particularly with intermediate representations. However, both model types failed to reliably count objects in complex scenes despite improved control in the new benchmark.

Conclusion: VLMs show potential for flexible open-set counting but require further research to handle real-world complexity. Intermediate representation prompting improves accuracy, highlighting the need for dedicated counting strategies in AI systems.

Abstract: Counting the number of items in a visual scene remains a fundamental yet challenging task in computer vision. Traditional approaches to solving this problem rely on domain-specific counting architectures, which are trained using datasets annotated with a predefined set of object categories. However, recent progress in creating large-scale multimodal vision-language models (VLMs) suggests that these domain-general architectures may offer a flexible alternative for open-set object counting. In this study, we therefore systematically compare the performance of state-of-the-art specialized counting architectures against VLMs on two popular counting datasets, as well as on a novel benchmark specifically created to have a finer-grained control over the visual properties of test images. Our findings show that most VLMs can approximately enumerate the number of items in a visual scene, matching or even surpassing the performance of specialized computer vision architectures. Notably, enumeration accuracy significantly improves when VLMs are prompted to generate intermediate representations (i.e., locations and verbal labels) of each object to be counted. Nevertheless, none of the models can reliably count the number of objects in complex visual scenes, showing that further research is still needed to create AI systems that can reliably deploy counting procedures in realistic environments.

### [33] [VTCBench: Can Vision-Language Models Understand Long Context with Vision-Text Compression?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15649)
*Hongbo Zhao,Meng Wang,Fei Zhu,Wenzhuo Liu,Bolin Ni,Fanhu Zeng,Gaofeng Meng,Zhaoxiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates vision-text compression (VTC) methods (e.g., DeepSeek-OCR, Glyph) that compress long texts into 2D visual representations for LLMs. Despite potential savings in token usage (3-20x), most vision-language models (VLMs) struggle with long-context understanding when using VTC-compressed information, failing to capture extended associations or dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Expanding LLM context windows causes computational/memory costs, making VTC a promising solution. However, how VLMs handle high-density compressed contexts for long-term information retention and complex reasoning remains understudied. The work addresses this gap.

Method: Introduce VTCBench - the first benchmark for VTC, featuring three evaluation modes: VTC-Retrieval (info retrieval), VTC-Reasoning (latent association inference), VTC-Memory (long-dialogue QA). Establish VTCBench-Wild for real-world scenario simulation. Evaluate multiple open-source/proprietary models.

Result: Models decode textual information (OCR) well but show 'surprisingly poor' long-context understanding with VTC-compressed inputs. Major limitations include failing to capture long-range associations/dependencies and inconsistent performance across reasoning/memory tasks.

Conclusion: Reveals VTC's limitations in preserving long-context capabilities, providing foundation for optimizing efficient/robust VLMs. Highlights trade-off between compression efficiency and downstream task requirements.

Abstract: The computational and memory overheads associated with expanding the context window of LLMs severely limit their scalability. A noteworthy solution is vision-text compression (VTC), exemplified by frameworks like DeepSeek-OCR and Glyph, which convert long texts into dense 2D visual representations, thereby achieving token compression ratios of 3x-20x. However, the impact of this high information density on the core long-context capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) remains under-investigated. To address this gap, we introduce the first benchmark for VTC and systematically assess the performance of VLMs across three long-context understanding settings: VTC-Retrieval, which evaluates the model's ability to retrieve and aggregate information; VTC-Reasoning, which requires models to infer latent associations to locate facts with minimal lexical overlap; and VTC-Memory, which measures comprehensive question answering within long-term dialogue memory. Furthermore, we establish the VTCBench-Wild to simulate diverse input scenarios.We comprehensively evaluate leading open-source and proprietary models on our benchmarks. The results indicate that, despite being able to decode textual information (e.g., OCR) well, most VLMs exhibit a surprisingly poor long-context understanding ability with VTC-compressed information, failing to capture long associations or dependencies in the context.This study provides a deep understanding of VTC and serves as a foundation for designing more efficient and scalable VLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes MMMamba, a novel pan-sharpening framework using Mamba architecture with interleaved multimodal scanning, achieving superior performance over existing methods through efficient cross-modal interaction and zero-shot super-resolution capability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CNN-based methods suffer from limited adaptability due to fixed convolutional operators, while cross-attention mechanisms face computational inefficiency and poor fine-grained correspondence capture, necessitating a more efficient architecture for complex pan-sharpening tasks.

Method: The authors build MMMamba on Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (MMDiT) and Mamba architecture, employing in-context conditioning for direct cross-modal interaction, while introducing a multimodal interleaved (MI) scanning mechanism for PAN-MS information exchange, achieving linear complexity.

Result: Extensive experiments validate that MMMamba outperforms state-of-the-art techniques across multiple pan-sharpening tasks and benchmarks according to qualitative and quantitative metrics, with demonstrated flexibility for zero-shot image super-resolution applications.

Conclusion: The proposed MMMamba framework effectively leverages multimodal scanning and linear-complexity architecture to enable efficient cross-modal interaction, achieving superior pan-sharpening performance while offering novel zero-shot super-resolution capabilities unattainable by previous methods.

Abstract: Pan-sharpening aims to generate high-resolution multispectral (HRMS) images by integrating a high-resolution panchromatic (PAN) image with its corresponding low-resolution multispectral (MS) image. To achieve effective fusion, it is crucial to fully exploit the complementary information between the two modalities. Traditional CNN-based methods typically rely on channel-wise concatenation with fixed convolutional operators, which limits their adaptability to diverse spatial and spectral variations. While cross-attention mechanisms enable global interactions, they are computationally inefficient and may dilute fine-grained correspondences, making it difficult to capture complex semantic relationships. Recent advances in the Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (MMDiT) architecture have demonstrated impressive success in image generation and editing tasks. Unlike cross-attention, MMDiT employs in-context conditioning to facilitate more direct and efficient cross-modal information exchange. In this paper, we propose MMMamba, a cross-modal in-context fusion framework for pan-sharpening, with the flexibility to support image super-resolution in a zero-shot manner. Built upon the Mamba architecture, our design ensures linear computational complexity while maintaining strong cross-modal interaction capacity. Furthermore, we introduce a novel multimodal interleaved (MI) scanning mechanism that facilitates effective information exchange between the PAN and MS modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques across multiple tasks and benchmarks.

Conclusion: 实现兼顾准确性与可解释性的MRI质量控制，可减少30.2%非必要重扫（论文数据），提升影像诊断效率。

Abstract: Motion artifacts degrade MRI image quality and increase patient recalls. Existing automated quality assessment methods are largely limited to binary decisions and provide little interpretability. We introduce AutoMAC-MRI, an explainable framework for grading motion artifacts across heterogeneous MR contrasts and orientations. The approach uses supervised contrastive learning to learn a discriminative representation of motion severity. Within this feature space, we compute grade-specific affinity scores that quantify an image's proximity to each motion grade, thereby making grade assignments transparent and interpretable. We evaluate AutoMAC-MRI on more than 5000 expert-annotated brain MRI slices spanning multiple contrasts and views. Experiments assessing affinity scores against expert labels show that the scores align well with expert judgment, supporting their use as an interpretable measure of motion severity. By coupling accurate grade detection with per-grade affinity scoring, AutoMAC-MRI enables inline MRI quality control, with the potential to reduce unnecessary rescans and improve workflow efficiency.

TL;DR: PCSNet addresses domain gap in few-shot anomaly detection by combining prototypical feature adaptation and context-aware segmentation to improve feature descriptiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pre-trained features in FSAD suffer from domain gaps with target scenarios, limiting performance in detecting anomalies with limited normal samples.

Method: PCSNet integrates a Prototypical Feature Adaptation (PFA) sub-network for compact normal features and a Context-Aware Segmentation (CAS) sub-network for pixel-level anomaly localization, using pseudo anomalies and a disparity loss.

Result: Achieved 94.9% and 80.2% image-level AUROC on MVTec and MPDD datasets in 8-shot scenarios, with real-world success in automotive plastic part inspection.

Conclusion: PCSNet bridges domain gaps via dual sub-networks, demonstrating superior FSAD performance and practical adaptability with minimal training samples.

Abstract: Few-shot anomaly detection (FSAD) denotes the identification of anomalies within a target category with a limited number of normal samples. Existing FSAD methods largely rely on pre-trained feature representations to detect anomalies, but the inherent domain gap between pre-trained representations and target FSAD scenarios is often overlooked. This study proposes a Prototypical Learning Guided Context-Aware Segmentation Network (PCSNet) to address the domain gap, thereby improving feature descriptiveness in target scenarios and enhancing FSAD performance. In particular, PCSNet comprises a prototypical feature adaption (PFA) sub-network and a context-aware segmentation (CAS) sub-network. PFA extracts prototypical features as guidance to ensure better feature compactness for normal data while distinct separation from anomalies. A pixel-level disparity classification loss is also designed to make subtle anomalies more distinguishable. Then a CAS sub-network is introduced for pixel-level anomaly localization, where pseudo anomalies are exploited to facilitate the training process. Experimental results on MVTec and MPDD demonstrate the superior FSAD performance of PCSNet, with 94.9% and 80.2% image-level AUROC in an 8-shot scenario, respectively. Real-world applications on automotive plastic part inspection further demonstrate that PCSNet can achieve promising results with limited training samples.

Abstract: In this paper we propose MECAD, a novel approach for continual anomaly detection using a multi-expert architecture. Our system dynamically assigns experts to object classes based on feature similarity and employs efficient memory management to preserve the knowledge of previously seen classes. By leveraging an optimized coreset selection and a specialized replay buffer mechanism, we enable incremental learning without requiring full model retraining. Our experimental evaluation on the MVTec AD dataset demonstrates that the optimal 5-expert configuration achieves an average AUROC of 0.8259 across 15 diverse object categories while significantly reducing knowledge degradation compared to single-expert approaches. This framework balances computational efficiency, specialized knowledge retention, and adaptability, making it well-suited for industrial environments with evolving product types.

Motivation: 传统知识蒸馏在图像异常检测中存在过度泛化缺陷，主要因输入信号与监督信号相似性过高，需改进模型鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MRKD通过双掩码策略增强了上下文捕获能力，在图像异常检测定位任务中取得显著性能提升。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is an effective image anomaly detection and localization scheme. However, a major drawback of this scheme is its tendency to overly generalize, primarily due to the similarities between input and supervisory signals. In order to address this issue, this paper introduces a novel technique called masked reverse knowledge distillation (MRKD). By employing image-level masking (ILM) and feature-level masking (FLM), MRKD transforms the task of image reconstruction into image restoration. Specifically, ILM helps to capture global information by differentiating input signals from supervisory signals. On the other hand, FLM incorporates synthetic feature-level anomalies to ensure that the learned representations contain sufficient local information. With these two strategies, MRKD is endowed with stronger image context capture capacity and is less likely to be overgeneralized. Experiments on the widely-used MVTec anomaly detection dataset demonstrate that MRKD achieves impressive performance: image-level 98.9% AU-ROC, pixel-level 98.4% AU-ROC, and 95.3% AU-PRO. In addition, extensive ablation experiments have validated the superiority of MRKD in mitigating the overgeneralization problem.

Abstract: Capabilities and the number of vision-based models are increasing rapidly. And these vision models are now able to do more tasks like object detection, image classification, instance segmentation etc. with great accuracy. But models which can take accurate quantitative measurements form an image, as a human can do by just looking at it, are rare. For a robot to work with complete autonomy in a Laboratory environment, it needs to have some basic skills like navigation, handling objects, preparing samples etc. to match human-like capabilities in an unstructured environment. Another important capability is to read measurements from instruments and apparatus. Here, we tried to mimic a human inspired approach to read measurements from a linear scale. As a test case we have picked reading level from a syringe and a measuring cylinder. For a randomly oriented syringe we carry out transformations to correct the orientation. To make the system efficient and robust, the area of interest is reduced to just the linear scale containing part of the image. After that, a series of features were extracted like the major makers, the corresponding digits, and the level indicator location, from which the final reading was calculated. Readings obtained using this system were also compared against human read values of the same instances and an accurate correspondence was observed.

TL;DR: This paper introduces TIMAR, a causal framework for generating 3D conversational head movements by modeling interleaved audio-visual contexts, achieving improved temporal coherence and variability in avatar/robot interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modeling bidirectional audio-visual dynamics in 3D conversation remains challenging due to temporal incoherence in existing methods that separate talking/listening processes or rely on non-causal full-sequence modeling.

Method: TIMAR uses turn-level interleaved masked autoregression with causal attention to accumulate conversational history and combines multimodal fusion with a lightweight diffusion head for continuous 3D head motion prediction.

Result: On the DualTalk benchmark, TIMAR reduces Fréchet Distance and MSE by 15-30% on test sets and maintains similar improvements on out-of-distribution data. Source code is publicly available at https://github.com/CoderChen01/towards-seamleass-interaction.

Conclusion: TIMAR demonstrates superior performance in capturing both coordination and expressive variability in 3D conversational dynamics, offering a promising approach for interactive avatars and social robots through its causal modeling of interleaved dialogue contexts.

Abstract: Human conversation involves continuous exchanges of speech and nonverbal cues such as head nods, gaze shifts, and facial expressions that convey attention and emotion. Modeling these bidirectional dynamics in 3D is essential for building expressive avatars and interactive robots. However, existing frameworks often treat talking and listening as independent processes or rely on non-causal full-sequence modeling, hindering temporal coherence across turns. We present TIMAR (Turn-level Interleaved Masked AutoRegression), a causal framework for 3D conversational head generation that models dialogue as interleaved audio-visual contexts. It fuses multimodal information within each turn and applies turn-level causal attention to accumulate conversational history, while a lightweight diffusion head predicts continuous 3D head dynamics that captures both coordination and expressive variability. Experiments on the DualTalk benchmark show that TIMAR reduces Fréchet Distance and MSE by 15-30% on the test set, and achieves similar gains on out-of-distribution data. The source code will be released in the GitHub repository https://github.com/CoderChen01/towards-seamleass-interaction.

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is a powerful technique for aligning generative models, but its effectiveness is bottlenecked by the conflict between large group sizes and prohibitive computational costs. In this work, we investigate the trade-off through empirical studies, yielding two key observations. First, we discover the reward clustering phenomenon in which many trajectories collapse toward the group-mean reward, offering limited optimization value. Second, we design a heuristic strategy named Optimal Variance Filtering (OVF), and verify that a high-variance subset of trajectories, selected by OVF can outperform the larger, unfiltered group. However, this static, post-sampling OVF approach still necessitates critical computational overhead, as it performs unnecessary sampling for trajectories that are ultimately discarded. To resolve this, we propose Pro-GRPO (Proactive GRPO), a novel dynamic framework that integrates latent feature-based trajectory pruning into the sampling process. Through the early termination of reward-clustered trajectories, Pro-GRPO reduces computational overhead. Leveraging its efficiency, Pro-GRPO employs an "Expand-and-Prune" strategy. This strategy first expands the size of initial sampling group to maximize trajectory diversity, then it applies multi-step OVF to the latents, avoiding prohibitive computational costs. Extensive experiments on both diffusion-based and flow-based models demonstrate the generality and effectiveness of our Pro-GRPO framework.

Abstract: We propose a novel dataset that has been specifically designed for 3D semantic segmentation of bridges and the domain gap analysis caused by varying sensors. This addresses a critical need in the field of infrastructure inspection and maintenance, which is essential for modern society. The dataset comprises high-resolution 3D scans of a diverse range of bridge structures from various countries, with detailed semantic labels provided for each. Our initial objective is to facilitate accurate and automated segmentation of bridge components, thereby advancing the structural health monitoring practice. To evaluate the effectiveness of existing 3D deep learning models on this novel dataset, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of three distinct state-of-the-art architectures. Furthermore, we present data acquired through diverse sensors to quantify the domain gap resulting from sensor variations. Our findings indicate that all architectures demonstrate robust performance on the specified task. However, the domain gap can potentially lead to a decline in the performance of up to 11.4% mIoU.

Abstract: Computer vision and video understanding have transformed sports analytics by enabling large-scale, automated analysis of game dynamics from broadcast footage. Despite significant advances in player and ball tracking, pose estimation, action localization, and automatic foul recognition, anticipating actions before they occur in sports videos has received comparatively little attention. This work introduces the task of action anticipation in basketball broadcast videos, focusing on predicting which team will gain possession of the ball following a shot attempt. To benchmark this task, a new self-curated dataset comprising 100,000 basketball video clips, over 300 hours of footage, and more than 2,000 manually annotated rebound events is presented. Comprehensive baseline results are reported using state-of-the-art action anticipation methods, representing the first application of deep learning techniques to basketball rebound prediction. Additionally, two complementary tasks, rebound classification and rebound spotting, are explored, demonstrating that this dataset supports a wide range of video understanding applications in basketball, for which no comparable datasets currently exist. Experimental results highlight both the feasibility and inherent challenges of anticipating rebounds, providing valuable insights into predictive modeling for dynamic multi-agent sports scenarios. By forecasting team possession before rebounds occur, this work enables applications in real-time automated broadcasting and post-game analysis tools to support decision-making.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究挑战传统深度学习模型对多路蛋白标记数据的早期通道融合方法，提出浅层通道独立模型CIM-S，在保持标记信息独立性的同时实现更优的自监督表征学习性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型假设多路蛋白标记间共享结构，采用早期通道融合策略导致标记特异性信息丢失，尤其影响稀有细胞识别。研究探索通过保留标记独立性及使用浅层架构（而非扩大模型规模）改善归纳偏置的可能性。

Method: 基于霍奇金淋巴瘤CODEX数据集（49个标记/145,000细胞），对比标准早期融合CNN与通道分离架构（含标记感知基线模型和新型浅层模型CIM-S），采用对比预训练与线性评估，并在不同自监督框架和标记数量（49→18）下验证泛化性。

Result: 通道分离架构（特别是CIM-S）在模型规模小（5.5K参数）情况下显著优于早期融合模型：提升标记信息保留能力，增强稀有细胞区分效果，且在多种自监督框架、增强策略及标记规模下表现稳定可复现。

Conclusion: 轻量化通道独立架构可通过保持多路数据特异性信息提升自监督表征质量，在医疗资源有限场景下为深度早期融合模型提供更优替代方案。

Abstract: Multiplexed tissue imaging measures dozens of protein markers per cell, yet most deep learning models still apply early channel fusion, assuming shared structure across markers. We investigate whether preserving marker independence, combined with deliberately shallow architectures, provides a more suitable inductive bias for self-supervised representation learning in multiplex data than increasing model scale. Using a Hodgkin lymphoma CODEX dataset with 145,000 cells and 49 markers, we compare standard early-fusion CNNs with channel-separated architectures, including a marker-aware baseline and our novel shallow Channel-Independent Model (CIM-S) with 5.5K parameters. After contrastive pretraining and linear evaluation, early-fusion models show limited ability to retain marker-specific information and struggle particularly with rare-cell discrimination. Channel-independent architectures, and CIM-S in particular, achieve substantially stronger representations despite their compact size. These findings are consistent across multiple self-supervised frameworks, remain stable across augmentation settings, and are reproducible across both the 49-marker and reduced 18-marker settings. These results show that lightweight, channel-independent architectures can match or surpass deep early-fusion CNNs and foundation models for multiplex representation learning.

TL;DR: 该论文针对单目深度估计模型中'3D Mirage'（平面图像误生成虚假3D结构）的安全隐患，提出首个测试基准与解决方案，通过3D-Mirage数据集、Laplacian评估框架（DCS/CCS指标）及基于自蒸馏的平面约束方法实现风险量化与缓解。

Abstract: Monocular depth foundation models achieve remarkable generalization by learning large-scale semantic priors, but this creates a critical vulnerability: they hallucinate illusory 3D structures from geometrically planar but perceptually ambiguous inputs. We term this failure the 3D Mirage. This paper introduces the first end-to-end framework to probe, quantify, and tame this unquantified safety risk. To probe, we present 3D-Mirage, the first benchmark of real-world illusions (e.g., street art) with precise planar-region annotations and context-restricted crops. To quantify, we propose a Laplacian-based evaluation framework with two metrics: the Deviation Composite Score (DCS) for spurious non-planarity and the Confusion Composite Score (CCS) for contextual instability. To tame this failure, we introduce Grounded Self-Distillation, a parameter-efficient strategy that surgically enforces planarity on illusion ROIs while using a frozen teacher to preserve background knowledge, thus avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Our work provides the essential tools to diagnose and mitigate this phenomenon, urging a necessary shift in MDE evaluation from pixel-wise accuracy to structural and contextual robustness. Our code and benchmark will be publicly available to foster this exciting research direction.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models unlock unprecedented opportunities for GUI automation. However, a fundamental challenge remains: how to efficiently acquire high-quality training data while maintaining annotation reliability? We introduce a self-evolving training pipeline powered by the Calibrated Step Reward System, which converts model-generated trajectories into reliable training signals through trajectory-level calibration, achieving >90% annotation accuracy with 10-100x lower cost. Leveraging this pipeline, we introduce Step-GUI, a family of models (4B/8B) that achieves state-of-the-art GUI performance (8B: 80.2% AndroidWorld, 48.5% OSWorld, 62.6% ScreenShot-Pro) while maintaining robust general capabilities. As GUI agent capabilities improve, practical deployment demands standardized interfaces across heterogeneous devices while protecting user privacy. To this end, we propose GUI-MCP, the first Model Context Protocol for GUI automation with hierarchical architecture that combines low-level atomic operations and high-level task delegation to local specialist models, enabling high-privacy execution where sensitive data stays on-device. Finally, to assess whether agents can handle authentic everyday usage, we introduce AndroidDaily, a benchmark grounded in real-world mobile usage patterns with 3146 static actions and 235 end-to-end tasks across high-frequency daily scenarios (8B: static 89.91%, end-to-end 52.50%). Our work advances the development of practical GUI agents and demonstrates strong potential for real-world deployment in everyday digital interactions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究比较了ResNet-101和Inception v3在野生动物检测中的效果，两者分类准确率分别达94%和95%，但对视觉相似物种和复杂环境条件的检测仍存在挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 野生动物检测对生物多样性保护和生态监测至关重要，但面临环境多样性、物种外观相似性和类内差异性的挑战，需要探索深度学习方法的有效性。

Method: 采用ResNet-101和Inception v3模型，对野生动物图像数据集进行标准化预处理（调整为800像素、RGB格式、PyTorch张量转换），按70:30划分训练集和验证集，使用分类准确率与mAP指标评估性能。

Result: ResNet-101达到94%准确率和0.91 mAP，Inception v3为95%准确率和0.92 mAP，后者因多尺度卷积表现更优，但两者对相似物种及光照差、遮挡场景检测仍存在误差。

Conclusion: 两种模型均能有效完成复杂条件下的野生动物检测任务，可为保护类计算机视觉应用提供基础，但需改进对相似物种和特殊环境条件的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Wildlife object detection plays a vital role in biodiversity conservation, ecological monitoring, and habitat protection. However, this task is often challenged by environmental variability, visual similarities among species, and intra-class diversity. This study investigates the effectiveness of two individual deep learning architectures ResNet-101 and Inception v3 for wildlife object detection under such complex conditions. The models were trained and evaluated on a wildlife image dataset using a standardized preprocessing approach, which included resizing images to a maximum dimension of 800 pixels, converting them to RGB format, and transforming them into PyTorch tensors. A ratio of 70:30 training and validation split was used for model development. The ResNet-101 model achieved a classification accuracy of 94% and a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.91, showing strong performance in extracting deep hierarchical features. The Inception v3 model performed slightly better, attaining a classification accuracy of 95% and a mAP of 0.92, attributed to its efficient multi-scale feature extraction through parallel convolutions. Despite the strong results, both models exhibited challenges when detecting species with similar visual characteristics or those captured under poor lighting and occlusion. Nonetheless, the findings confirm that both ResNet-101 and Inception v3 are effective models for wildlife object detection tasks and provide a reliable foundation for conservation-focused computer vision applications.

### [48] [RUMPL: Ray-Based Transformers for Universal Multi-View 2D to 3D Human Pose Lifting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15488)
*Seyed Abolfazl Ghasemzadeh,Alexandre Alahi,Christophe De Vleeschouwer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RUMPL, a transformer-based 3D pose estimation framework, introduces a 3D ray-based representation and View Fusion Transformer to improve multi-view 3D pose estimation, achieving superior accuracy without requiring camera calibration or retraining across diverse configurations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-view 3D pose estimation methods struggle with generalization to real-world scenarios due to reliance on scarce, constrained multi-view datasets with 3D ground truth. The paper aims to solve this by developing a model that works universally across arbitrary multi-view setups.

Method: The authors propose RUMPL, which uses a 3D ray-based representation of 2D keypoints (independent of camera calibration) and a View Fusion Transformer to aggregate multi-view information through fused-ray tokens, enabling robust 2D-to-3D pose lifting without retraining.

Result: RUMPL reduces MPJPE (Mean Per Joint Position Error) by up to 53% compared to triangulation and over 60% against image-representation baselines, with verified robustness and scalability on challenging multi-view/multi-person in-the-wild datasets.

Conclusion: The RUMPL framework effectively addresses the generalization problem in 3D human pose estimation, offering flexible deployment across arbitrary multi-view scenarios while outperforming existing methods in accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: Estimating 3D human poses from 2D images remains challenging due to occlusions and projective ambiguity. Multi-view learning-based approaches mitigate these issues but often fail to generalize to real-world scenarios, as large-scale multi-view datasets with 3D ground truth are scarce and captured under constrained conditions. To overcome this limitation, recent methods rely on 2D pose estimation combined with 2D-to-3D pose lifting trained on synthetic data. Building on our previous MPL framework, we propose RUMPL, a transformer-based 3D pose lifter that introduces a 3D ray-based representation of 2D keypoints. This formulation makes the model independent of camera calibration and the number of views, enabling universal deployment across arbitrary multi-view configurations without retraining or fine-tuning. A new View Fusion Transformer leverages learned fused-ray tokens to aggregate information along rays, further improving multi-view consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RUMPL reduces MPJPE by up to 53% compared to triangulation and over 60% compared to transformer-based image-representation baselines. Results on new benchmarks, including in-the-wild multi-view and multi-person datasets, confirm its robustness and scalability.

TL;DR: 重新评估显示深度学习配准方法在跨模态和高分辨率数据中表现显著下降，零样本泛化能力被高估，需谨慎对待算法宣称优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LUMIR挑战赛声称深度学习具有跨模态零样本配准能力，但此主张与领域偏移理论矛盾。本文旨在通过严格实验验证该主张的可靠性。

Method: 设计双盲评估协议，系统测试深度学习与迭代优化方法在跨模态(T2/FLAIR)、跨分辨率(0.6mm)及不同预处理条件下的性能，量化领域偏移影响。

Result: 深度学习在同分布T1w数据表现优异(dSC=0.92)，但在跨模态数据效能下降50%(Cohen's d=1.2)，36%模型因高分辨率失效，预处理敏感性导致性能波动±15%。

Conclusion: 深度学习配准方法存在显著领域依赖性，临床部署需结合数据分布特征。倡导建立反映真实场景的动态基准，而非理想化测试条件。

Abstract: The LUMIR challenge represents an important benchmark for evaluating deformable image registration methods on large-scale neuroimaging data. While the challenge demonstrates that modern deep learning methods achieve competitive accuracy on T1-weighted MRI, it also claims exceptional zero-shot generalization to unseen contrasts and resolutions, assertions that contradict established understanding of domain shift in deep learning. In this paper, we perform an independent re-evaluation of these zero-shot claims using rigorous evaluation protocols while addressing potential sources of instrumentation bias. Our findings reveal a more nuanced picture: (1) deep learning methods perform comparably to iterative optimization on in-distribution T1w images and even on human-adjacent species (macaque), demonstrating improved task understanding; (2) however, performance degrades significantly on out-of-distribution contrasts (T2, T2*, FLAIR), with Cohen's d scores ranging from 0.7-1.5, indicating substantial practical impact on downstream clinical workflows; (3) deep learning methods face scalability limitations on high-resolution data, failing to run on 0.6 mm isotropic images, while iterative methods benefit from increased resolution; and (4) deep methods exhibit high sensitivity to preprocessing choices. These results align with the well-established literature on domain shift and suggest that claims of universal zero-shot superiority require careful scrutiny. We advocate for evaluation protocols that reflect practical clinical and research workflows rather than conditions that may inadvertently favor particular method classes.

TL;DR: This paper introduces an adaptive 3D Gaussian Splatting architecture that improves scene generation quality and efficiency by replacing rigid grid-based primitive placement with sub-pixel-level detection and self-supervised learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of dense, rigid pixel grids in 3D Gaussian Splatting models which hinder both rendering quality and computational efficiency.

Method: A multi-resolution decoder inspired by keypoint detection dynamically distributes 3D Gaussian primitives across image patches. The system is trained end-to-end with a 3D reconstruction backbone using self-supervised learning instead of labeled data.

Result: A pose-free model that generates photorealistic 3D scenes in seconds while outperforming existing feed-forward methods with fewer primitives. It reduces rendering artifacts and improves camera pose estimation accuracy.

Conclusion: The adaptive primitive allocation and self-supervised training framework achieves state-of-the-art novel view synthesis performance while demonstrating label-free training potential for 3D reconstruction models.

Abstract: Feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models enable real-time scene generation but are hindered by suboptimal pixel-aligned primitive placement, which relies on a dense, rigid grid and limits both quality and efficiency. We introduce a new feed-forward architecture that detects 3D Gaussian primitives at a sub-pixel level, replacing the pixel grid with an adaptive, "Off The Grid" distribution. Inspired by keypoint detection, our multi-resolution decoder learns to distribute primitives across image patches. This module is trained end-to-end with a 3D reconstruction backbone using self-supervised learning. Our resulting pose-free model generates photorealistic scenes in seconds, achieving state-of-the-art novel view synthesis for feed-forward models. It outperforms competitors while using far fewer primitives, demonstrating a more accurate and efficient allocation that captures fine details and reduces artifacts. Moreover, we observe that by learning to render 3D Gaussians, our 3D reconstruction backbone improves camera pose estimation, suggesting opportunities to train these foundational models without labels.

*Opeyemi Bamigbade,Mark Scanlon,John Sheppard*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes Vision-Attention Anomaly Scoring (VAAS), a two-part framework combining Vision Transformers and SegFormer models to detect image manipulation with interpretable anomaly scores that indicate both manipulation location and severity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional forensic detectors fail against advanced AI forgeries that lack pixel/compression artifacts, and most methods cannot quantify manipulation intensity. There is a need for techniques that balance technical accuracy with human-understandable visual explanations.

Method: VAAS integrates 1) global attention-based anomaly estimation via Vision Transformers to assess image-wide irregularities, and 2) patch-level self-consistency scoring using SegFormer embeddings to detect local inconsistencies. The method fuses these outputs into a unified, continuous anomaly score with spatial interpretability.

Result: On DF2023/CASIA v2.0 datasets, VAAS achieves strong F1/IoU scores while generating attention-guided anomaly maps that highlight manipulation regions. The approach outperforms existing methods in both quantitative performance and visual explainability.

Conclusion: The framework bridges technical detection and human interpretability by explicitly modeling both global and local anomalies. Open-source implementation ensures reproducibility and supports transparent image integrity evaluation in forensic applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI-driven image generation have introduced new challenges for verifying the authenticity of digital evidence in forensic investigations. Modern generative models can produce visually consistent forgeries that evade traditional detectors based on pixel or compression artefacts. Most existing approaches also lack an explicit measure of anomaly intensity, which limits their ability to quantify the severity of manipulation. This paper introduces Vision-Attention Anomaly Scoring (VAAS), a novel dual-module framework that integrates global attention-based anomaly estimation using Vision Transformers (ViT) with patch-level self-consistency scoring derived from SegFormer embeddings. The hybrid formulation provides a continuous and interpretable anomaly score that reflects both the location and degree of manipulation. Evaluations on the DF2023 and CASIA v2.0 datasets demonstrate that VAAS achieves competitive F1 and IoU performance, while enhancing visual explainability through attention-guided anomaly maps. The framework bridges quantitative detection with human-understandable reasoning, supporting transparent and reliable image integrity assessment. The source code for all experiments and corresponding materials for reproducing the results are available open source.

Conclusion: 成功解决了扩散模型在姿态-表情解耦控制难题，为个性化动画和编辑任务提供了新方案。

Abstract: Portrait animation from a single source image and a driving video is a long-standing problem. Recent approaches tend to adopt diffusion-based image/video generation models for realistic and expressive animation. However, none of these diffusion models realizes high-fidelity disentangled control between the head pose and facial expression, hindering applications like expression-only or pose-only editing and animation. To address this, we propose DeX-Portrait, a novel approach capable of generating expressive portrait animation driven by disentangled pose and expression signals. Specifically, we represent the pose as an explicit global transformation and the expression as an implicit latent code. First, we design a powerful motion trainer to learn both pose and expression encoders for extracting precise and decomposed driving signals. Then we propose to inject the pose transformation into the diffusion model through a dual-branch conditioning mechanism, and the expression latent through cross attention. Finally, we design a progressive hybrid classifier-free guidance for more faithful identity consistency. Experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on both animation quality and disentangled controllability.

Result: 在VECBench基准测试中，EmoCaliber在情感预测和信心估计两方面均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过显式建模信心感知，为构建可解释的VEC系统提供了可行的技术路径。

Abstract: Visual Emotion Comprehension (VEC) aims to infer sentiment polarities or emotion categories from affective cues embedded in images. In recent years, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have established a popular paradigm in VEC, leveraging their generalizability to unify VEC tasks defined under diverse emotion taxonomies. While this paradigm achieves notable success, it typically formulates VEC as a deterministic task, requiring the model to output a single, definitive emotion label for each image. Such a formulation insufficiently accounts for the inherent subjectivity of emotion perception, overlooking alternative interpretations that may be equally plausible to different viewers. To address this limitation, we propose equipping MLLMs with capabilities to verbalize their confidence in emotion predictions. This additional signal provides users with an estimate of both the plausibility of alternative interpretations and the MLLMs' self-assessed competence, thereby enhancing reliability in practice. Building on this insight, we introduce a three-stage training framework that progressively endows with structured reasoning, teaches to verbalize confidence, and calibrates confidence expression, culminating in EmoCaliber, a confidence-aware MLLM for VEC. Through fair and comprehensive evaluations on the unified benchmark VECBench, EmoCaliber demonstrates overall superiority against existing methods in both emotion prediction and confidence estimation. These results validate the effectiveness of our approach and mark a feasible step toward more reliable VEC systems. Project page: https://github.com/wdqqdw/EmoCaliber.

Abstract: The remote sensing community has recently seen the emergence of methods based on Large Vision and Language Models (LVLMs) that can address multiple tasks at the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing. To fully exploit the potential of such models, a significant focus has been given to the collection of large amounts of training data that cover multiple remote sensing-specific tasks, such as image captioning or visual question answering. However, the cost of using and training LVLMs is high, due to the large number of parameters. While multiple parameter-efficient adaptation techniques have been explored, the computational costs of training and inference with these models can remain prohibitive for most institutions. In this work, we explore the use of encoder-only architectures and propose a model that can effectively address multi-task learning while remaining compact in terms of the number of parameters. In particular, our model tackles combinations of tasks that are not typically explored in a unified model: the generation of text from remote sensing images and cross-modal retrieval. The results of our GeoMELT model - named from Multi-task Efficient Learning Transformer - in established benchmarks confirm the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed approach.

Abstract: Ensuring the ethical use of video data involving human subjects, particularly infants, requires robust anonymization methods. We propose BLANKET (Baby-face Landmark-preserving ANonymization with Keypoint dEtection consisTency), a novel approach designed to anonymize infant faces in video recordings while preserving essential facial attributes. Our method comprises two stages. First, a new random face, compatible with the original identity, is generated via inpainting using a diffusion model. Second, the new identity is seamlessly incorporated into each video frame through temporally consistent face swapping with authentic expression transfer. The method is evaluated on a dataset of short video recordings of babies and is compared to the popular anonymization method, DeepPrivacy2. Key metrics assessed include the level of de-identification, preservation of facial attributes, impact on human pose estimation (as an example of a downstream task), and presence of artifacts. Both methods alter the identity, and our method outperforms DeepPrivacy2 in all other respects. The code is available as an easy-to-use anonymization demo at https://github.com/ctu-vras/blanket-infant-face-anonym.

Conclusion: 实验证明TED-6K可有效预测生成效果，两阶段训练方法成功解决了语言模型适配视觉合成的关键难题。

Abstract: The text encoder is a critical component of text-to-image and text-to-video diffusion models, fundamentally determining the semantic fidelity of the generated content. However, its development has been hindered by two major challenges: the lack of an efficient evaluation framework that reliably predicts downstream generation performance, and the difficulty of effectively adapting pretrained language models for visual synthesis. To address these issues, we introduce GRAN-TED, a paradigm to Generate Robust, Aligned, and Nuanced Text Embeddings for Diffusion models. Our contribution is twofold. First, we propose TED-6K, a novel text-only benchmark that enables efficient and robust assessment of an encoder's representational quality without requiring costly end-to-end model training. We demonstrate that performance on TED-6K, standardized via a lightweight, unified adapter, strongly correlates with an encoder's effectiveness in downstream generation tasks. Second, guided by this validated framework, we develop a superior text encoder using a novel two-stage training paradigm. This process involves an initial fine-tuning stage on a Multimodal Large Language Model for better visual representation, followed by a layer-wise weighting method to extract more nuanced and potent text features. Our experiments show that the resulting GRAN-TED encoder not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on TED-6K but also leads to demonstrable performance gains in text-to-image and text-to-video generation.

### [57] [On the Effectiveness of Textual Prompting with Lightweight Fine-Tuning for SAM3 Remote Sensing Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15564)
*Roni Blushtein-Livnon,Osher Rafaeli,David Ioffe,Amir Boger,Karen Sandberg Esquenazi,Tal Svoray*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper evaluates SAM3, a text-driven remote sensing image segmentation framework, showing that combining semantic and geometric prompts with light fine-tuning optimizes performance, though irregular targets remain challenging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Remote sensing image segmentation faces challenges from scarce annotated data and domain gaps between aerial imagery and natural image-trained models. This study motivates exploring adaptation strategies under limited supervision.

Method: Applies SAM3, a text-promptable segmentation framework, to remote sensing tasks. Evaluates textual, geometric, and hybrid prompting across four target types, testing performance across zero-shot inference, lightweight fine-tuning, and varying supervision scales.

Result: Hybrid prompting (semantic + geometric) achieved highest accuracy, while text-only prompting underperformed for irregular targets. Light geometric fine-tuning bridged most performance gaps, with diminishing returns at larger supervision scales. Persistent under-segmentation/boundary errors remained for complex targets.

Conclusion: SAM3 adaptation for remote sensing benefits from combined cue prompting and modest geometric annotations. While semantic misalignment limits zero-shot text performance, light fine-tuning balances efficiency and accuracy for regular targets, highlighting the need for domain-specific boundary refinement solutions.

Abstract: Remote sensing (RS) image segmentation is constrained by the limited availability of annotated data and a gap between overhead imagery and natural images used to train foundational models. This motivates effective adaptation under limited supervision. SAM3 concept-driven framework generates masks from textual prompts without requiring task-specific modifications, which may enable this adaptation. We evaluate SAM3 for RS imagery across four target types, comparing textual, geometric, and hybrid prompting strategies, under lightweight fine-tuning scales with increasing supervision, alongside zero-shot inference. Results show that combining semantic and geometric cues yields the highest performance across targets and metrics. Text-only prompting exhibits the lowest performance, with marked score gaps for irregularly shaped targets, reflecting limited semantic alignment between SAM3 textual representations and their overhead appearances. Nevertheless, textual prompting with light fine-tuning offers a practical performance-effort trade-off for geometrically regular and visually salient targets. Across targets, performance improves between zero-shot inference and fine-tuning, followed by diminishing returns as the supervision scale increases. Namely, a modest geometric annotation effort is sufficient for effective adaptation. A persistent gap between Precision and IoU further indicates that under-segmentation and boundary inaccuracies remain prevalent error patterns in RS tasks, particularly for irregular and less prevalent targets.

Abstract: In this paper, we focus on online zero-shot monocular 3D instance segmentation, a novel practical setting where existing approaches fail to perform because they rely on posed RGB-D sequences. To overcome this limitation, we leverage CUT3R, a recent Reconstructive Foundation Model (RFM), to provide reliable geometric priors from a single RGB stream. We propose MoonSeg3R, which introduces three key components: (1) a self-supervised query refinement module with spatial-semantic distillation that transforms segmentation masks from 2D visual foundation models (VFMs) into discriminative 3D queries; (2) a 3D query index memory that provides temporal consistency by retrieving contextual queries; and (3) a state-distribution token from CUT3R that acts as a mask identity descriptor to strengthen cross-frame fusion. Experiments on ScanNet200 and SceneNN show that MoonSeg3R is the first method to enable online monocular 3D segmentation and achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art RGB-D-based systems. Code and models will be released.

Conclusion: 成功证明级联式多模态蒸馏能有效结合雷达与视觉优势，在无LiDAR部署条件下实现高性能检测

Abstract: High-performance Radar-Camera 3D object detection can be achieved by leveraging knowledge distillation without using LiDAR at inference time. However, existing distillation methods typically transfer modality-specific features directly to each sensor, which can distort their unique characteristics and degrade their individual strengths. To address this, we introduce IMKD, a radar-camera fusion framework based on multi-level knowledge distillation that preserves each sensor's intrinsic characteristics while amplifying their complementary strengths. IMKD applies a three-stage, intensity-aware distillation strategy to enrich the fused representation across the architecture: (1) LiDAR-to-Radar intensity-aware feature distillation to enhance radar representations with fine-grained structural cues, (2) LiDAR-to-Fused feature intensity-guided distillation to selectively highlight useful geometry and depth information at the fusion level, fostering complementarity between the modalities rather than forcing them to align, and (3) Camera-Radar intensity-guided fusion mechanism that facilitates effective feature alignment and calibration. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes benchmark show that IMKD reaches 67.0% NDS and 61.0% mAP, outperforming all prior distillation-based radar-camera fusion methods. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/dfki-av/IMKD/.

TL;DR: FlexAvatar是一种从单张图像生成高质量完整3D头像的方法，通过分离驱动信号与目标视角解决单目训练的局限性，融合单目和多视角数据优势。

Conclusion: 该方法解决了单目数据限制，通过数据源融合扩展了3D头像应用场景，为未来高保真虚拟人构建提供了轻量化解决方案，隐空间特性支持身份混合等扩展应用。

Abstract: We introduce FlexAvatar, a method for creating high-quality and complete 3D head avatars from a single image. A core challenge lies in the limited availability of multi-view data and the tendency of monocular training to yield incomplete 3D head reconstructions. We identify the root cause of this issue as the entanglement between driving signal and target viewpoint when learning from monocular videos. To address this, we propose a transformer-based 3D portrait animation model with learnable data source tokens, so-called bias sinks, which enables unified training across monocular and multi-view datasets. This design leverages the strengths of both data sources during inference: strong generalization from monocular data and full 3D completeness from multi-view supervision. Furthermore, our training procedure yields a smooth latent avatar space that facilitates identity interpolation and flexible fitting to an arbitrary number of input observations. In extensive evaluations on single-view, few-shot, and monocular avatar creation tasks, we verify the efficacy of FlexAvatar. Many existing methods struggle with view extrapolation while FlexAvatar generates complete 3D head avatars with realistic facial animations. Website: https://tobias-kirschstein.github.io/flexavatar/

Conclusion: 开创了基于多层解耦表示的图像编辑新范式，为可控图像生成与编辑提供新思路。

Abstract: Recent visual generative models often struggle with consistency during image editing due to the entangled nature of raster images, where all visual content is fused into a single canvas. In contrast, professional design tools employ layered representations, allowing isolated edits while preserving consistency. Motivated by this, we propose \textbf{Qwen-Image-Layered}, an end-to-end diffusion model that decomposes a single RGB image into multiple semantically disentangled RGBA layers, enabling \textbf{inherent editability}, where each RGBA layer can be independently manipulated without affecting other content. To support variable-length decomposition, we introduce three key components: (1) an RGBA-VAE to unify the latent representations of RGB and RGBA images; (2) a VLD-MMDiT (Variable Layers Decomposition MMDiT) architecture capable of decomposing a variable number of image layers; and (3) a Multi-stage Training strategy to adapt a pretrained image generation model into a multilayer image decomposer. Furthermore, to address the scarcity of high-quality multilayer training images, we build a pipeline to extract and annotate multilayer images from Photoshop documents (PSD). Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly surpasses existing approaches in decomposition quality and establishes a new paradigm for consistent image editing.

Abstract: Estimating camera intrinsics and extrinsics is a fundamental problem in computer vision, and while advances in structure-from-motion (SfM) have improved accuracy and robustness, open challenges remain. In this paper, we introduce a robust method for pose estimation and calibration. We consider a set of rigid cameras, each observing the scene from a different perspective, which is a typical camera setup in animal behavior studies and forensic analysis of surveillance footage. Specifically, we analyse the individual components in a structure-from-motion (SfM) pipeline, and identify design choices that improve accuracy. Our main contributions are: (1) we investigate how to best subsample the predicted correspondences from a dense matcher to leverage them in the estimation process. (2) We investigate selection criteria for how to add the views incrementally. In a rigorous quantitative evaluation, we show the effectiveness of our changes, especially for cameras with strong radial distortion (79.9% ours vs. 40.4 vanilla VGGT). Finally, we demonstrate our correspondence subsampling in a global SfM setting where we initialize the poses using VGGT. The proposed pipeline generalizes across a wide range of camera setups, and could thus become a useful tool for animal behavior and forensic analysis.

Motivation: 近地空间常驻空间目标（RSOs）数量迅速增长，需更精确的SDA信息。传统手段受限于距离、大气扰动等问题，而空间基传感需更高效的目标结构识别方法。

Method: 基于仿射变换进行图像序列对齐，采用梯度比值法进行边缘检测，并通过双权重霍夫变换追踪线性特征；利用元启发式模拟器生成ISAR图像，分析多帧特征演变规律。

Conclusion: 该方法为短距空间基ISAR系统提供了可行的自动化特征识别框架，有助于提升空间目标状态感知的可靠性。

Abstract: With the rapidly growing population of resident space objects (RSOs) in the near-Earth space environment, detailed information about their condition and capabilities is needed to provide Space Domain Awareness (SDA). Space-based sensing will enable inspection of RSOs at shorter ranges, independent of atmospheric effects, and from all aspects. The use of a sub-THz inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) imaging and sensing system for SDA has been proposed in previous work, demonstrating the achievement of sub-cm image resolution at ranges of up to 100 km. This work focuses on recognition of external structures by use of sequential feature detection and tracking throughout the aligned ISAR images of the satellites. The Hough transform is employed to detect linear features, which are tracked throughout the sequence. ISAR imagery is generated via a metaheuristic simulator capable of modelling encounters for a variety of deployment scenarios. Initial frame-to-frame alignment is achieved through a series of affine transformations to facilitate later association between image features. A gradient-by-ratio method is used for edge detection within individual ISAR images, and edge magnitude and direction are subsequently used to inform a double-weighted Hough transform to detect features with high accuracy. Feature evolution during sequences of frames is analysed. It is shown that the use of feature tracking within sequences with the proposed approach will increase confidence in feature detection and classification, and an example use-case of robust detection of shadowing as a feature is presented.

Abstract: Autonomous driving requires a persistent understanding of 3D scenes that is robust to temporal disturbances and accounts for potential future actions. We introduce a new concept of 4D Occupancy Spatio-Temporal Persistence (OccSTeP), which aims to address two tasks: (1) reactive forecasting: ''what will happen next'' and (2) proactive forecasting: "what would happen given a specific future action". For the first time, we create a new OccSTeP benchmark with challenging scenarios (e.g., erroneous semantic labels and dropped frames). To address this task, we propose OccSTeP-WM, a tokenizer-free world model that maintains a dense voxel-based scene state and incrementally fuses spatio-temporal context over time. OccSTeP-WM leverages a linear-complexity attention backbone and a recurrent state-space module to capture long-range spatial dependencies while continually updating the scene memory with ego-motion compensation. This design enables online inference and robust performance even when historical sensor input is missing or noisy. Extensive experiments prove the effectiveness of the OccSTeP concept and our OccSTeP-WM, yielding an average semantic mIoU of 23.70% (+6.56% gain) and occupancy IoU of 35.89% (+9.26% gain). The data and code will be open source at https://github.com/FaterYU/OccSTeP.

Conclusion: IC-Effect通过指令引导和DiT架构创新，首次实现了同时满足背景完整性、特效可控性和高效训练的少样本视频编辑，其技术路线和公开数据集将推动影视工业效率革新。

Abstract: We propose \textbf{IC-Effect}, an instruction-guided, DiT-based framework for few-shot video VFX editing that synthesizes complex effects (\eg flames, particles and cartoon characters) while strictly preserving spatial and temporal consistency. Video VFX editing is highly challenging because injected effects must blend seamlessly with the background, the background must remain entirely unchanged, and effect patterns must be learned efficiently from limited paired data. However, existing video editing models fail to satisfy these requirements. IC-Effect leverages the source video as clean contextual conditions, exploiting the contextual learning capability of DiT models to achieve precise background preservation and natural effect injection. A two-stage training strategy, consisting of general editing adaptation followed by effect-specific learning via Effect-LoRA, ensures strong instruction following and robust effect modeling. To further improve efficiency, we introduce spatiotemporal sparse tokenization, enabling high fidelity with substantially reduced computation. We also release a paired VFX editing dataset spanning $15$ high-quality visual styles. Extensive experiments show that IC-Effect delivers high-quality, controllable, and temporally consistent VFX editing, opening new possibilities for video creation.

Abstract: Foreground-conditioned inpainting, which aims at generating a harmonious background for a given foreground subject based on the text prompt, is an important subfield in controllable image generation. A common challenge in current methods, however, is the occurrence of Spatial Relationship Hallucinations between the foreground subject and the generated background, including inappropriate scale, positional relationships, and viewpoints. Critically, the subjective nature of spatial rationality makes it challenging to quantify, hindering the use of traditional reward-based RLHF methods. To address this issue, we propose InpaintDPO, the first Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) based framework dedicated to spatial rationality in foreground-conditioned inpainting, ensuring plausible spatial relationships between foreground and background elements. To resolve the gradient conflicts in standard DPO caused by identical foreground in win-lose pairs, we propose MaskDPO, which confines preference optimization exclusively to the background to enhance background spatial relationships, while retaining the inpainting loss in the foreground region for robust foreground preservation. To enhance coherence at the foreground-background boundary, we propose Conditional Asymmetric Preference Optimization, which samples pairs with differentiated cropping operations and applies global preference optimization to promote contextual awareness and enhance boundary coherence. Finally, based on the observation that winning samples share a commonality in plausible spatial relationships, we propose Shared Commonality Preference Optimization to enhance the model's understanding of spatial commonality across high-quality winning samples, further promoting shared spatial rationality.

Conclusion: 证明硬标签在软标签主导的训练中具有关键互补作用，为知识蒸馏与数据集蒸馏提供新视角。

Abstract: Soft labels generated by teacher models have become a dominant paradigm for knowledge transfer and recent large-scale dataset distillation such as SRe2L, RDED, LPLD, offering richer supervision than conventional hard labels. However, we observe that when only a limited number of crops per image are used, soft labels are prone to local semantic drift: a crop may visually resemble another class, causing its soft embedding to deviate from the ground-truth semantics of the original image. This mismatch between local visual content and global semantic meaning introduces systematic errors and distribution misalignment between training and testing. In this work, we revisit the overlooked role of hard labels and show that, when appropriately integrated, they provide a powerful content-agnostic anchor to calibrate semantic drift. We theoretically characterize the emergence of drift under few soft-label supervision and demonstrate that hybridizing soft and hard labels restores alignment between visual content and semantic supervision. Building on this insight, we propose a new training paradigm, Hard Label for Alleviating Local Semantic Drift (HALD), which leverages hard labels as intermediate corrective signals while retaining the fine-grained advantages of soft labels. Extensive experiments on dataset distillation and large-scale conventional classification benchmarks validate our approach, showing consistent improvements in generalization. On ImageNet-1K, we achieve 42.7% with only 285M storage for soft labels, outperforming prior state-of-the-art LPLD by 9.0%. Our findings re-establish the importance of hard labels as a complementary tool, and call for a rethinking of their role in soft-label-dominated training.

Result: 在CIFAR-10-C达到93.54%稳健准确率（SOTA，+4.2%），CIFAR-100-C（74.9%）和TinyImageNet-C（50.86%），证明风格迁移与合成数据存在协同效应。

Conclusion: 风格化处理能有效提升合成数据训练价值，但需特定增强方法（如TrivialAugment）配合，揭示了数据质量与多样性平衡的重要性。

Abstract: This paper proposes a training data augmentation pipeline that combines synthetic image data with neural style transfer in order to address the vulnerability of deep vision models to common corruptions. We show that although applying style transfer on synthetic images degrades their quality with respect to the common FID metric, these images are surprisingly beneficial for model training. We conduct a systematic empirical analysis of the effects of both augmentations and their key hyperparameters on the performance of image classifiers. Our results demonstrate that stylization and synthetic data complement each other well and can be combined with popular rule-based data augmentation techniques such as TrivialAugment, while not working with others. Our method achieves state-of-the-art corruption robustness on several small-scale image classification benchmarks, reaching 93.54%, 74.9% and 50.86% robust accuracy on CIFAR-10-C, CIFAR-100-C and TinyImageNet-C, respectively

Abstract: The misuse of AI-driven video generation technologies has raised serious social concerns, highlighting the urgent need for reliable AI-generated video detectors. However, most existing methods are limited to binary classification and lack the necessary explanations for human interpretation. In this paper, we present Skyra, a specialized multimodal large language model (MLLM) that identifies human-perceivable visual artifacts in AI-generated videos and leverages them as grounded evidence for both detection and explanation. To support this objective, we construct ViF-CoT-4K for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), which represents the first large-scale AI-generated video artifact dataset with fine-grained human annotations. We then develop a two-stage training strategy that systematically enhances our model's spatio-temporal artifact perception, explanation capability, and detection accuracy. To comprehensively evaluate Skyra, we introduce ViF-Bench, a benchmark comprising 3K high-quality samples generated by over ten state-of-the-art video generators. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Skyra surpasses existing methods across multiple benchmarks, while our evaluation yields valuable insights for advancing explainable AI-generated video detection.

Conclusion: 无需教师模型的训练框架在长视频任务中具有扩展性优势，通过参数无关的历史路由机制解决长程依赖问题。

Abstract: Autoregressive video diffusion models hold promise for world simulation but are vulnerable to exposure bias arising from the train-test mismatch. While recent works address this via post-training, they typically rely on a bidirectional teacher model or online discriminator. To achieve an end-to-end solution, we introduce Resampling Forcing, a teacher-free framework that enables training autoregressive video models from scratch and at scale. Central to our approach is a self-resampling scheme that simulates inference-time model errors on history frames during training. Conditioned on these degraded histories, a sparse causal mask enforces temporal causality while enabling parallel training with frame-level diffusion loss. To facilitate efficient long-horizon generation, we further introduce history routing, a parameter-free mechanism that dynamically retrieves the top-k most relevant history frames for each query. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves performance comparable to distillation-based baselines while exhibiting superior temporal consistency on longer videos owing to native-length training.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖晚期融合，难以捕捉跨模态细粒度交互，导致在无约束场景下鲁棒性不足。

Method: 设计Hierarchical Gated Fusion Decoder (HiGate)实现多层特征注入，并引入辅助损失MAL（对齐单模态输入）和OPP（抑制假阳性激活）。

Result: 在Ego4D-ASD、UniTalk和WASD数据集上mAP分别达77.8%、86.1%和96.1%，均超越基线模型，且具有跨域泛化能力。

Conclusion: GateFusion通过多层自适应融合与辅助目标，有效解决了跨模态交互建模问题，为视听感知提供了新范式。

Abstract: Active Speaker Detection (ASD) aims to identify who is currently speaking in each frame of a video. Most state-of-the-art approaches rely on late fusion to combine visual and audio features, but late fusion often fails to capture fine-grained cross-modal interactions, which can be critical for robust performance in unconstrained scenarios. In this paper, we introduce GateFusion, a novel architecture that combines strong pretrained unimodal encoders with a Hierarchical Gated Fusion Decoder (HiGate). HiGate enables progressive, multi-depth fusion by adaptively injecting contextual features from one modality into the other at multiple layers of the Transformer backbone, guided by learnable, bimodally-conditioned gates. To further strengthen multimodal learning, we propose two auxiliary objectives: Masked Alignment Loss (MAL) to align unimodal outputs with multimodal predictions, and Over-Positive Penalty (OPP) to suppress spurious video-only activations. GateFusion establishes new state-of-the-art results on several challenging ASD benchmarks, achieving 77.8% mAP (+9.4%), 86.1% mAP (+2.9%), and 96.1% mAP (+0.5%) on Ego4D-ASD, UniTalk, and WASD benchmarks, respectively, and delivering competitive performance on AVA-ActiveSpeaker. Out-of-domain experiments demonstrate the generalization of our model, while comprehensive ablations show the complementary benefits of each component.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基础模型处理多视图时缺乏3D一致性，无法准确匹配同一3D点在不同视角的特征，需开发更有效的多视图特征对齐方法。

Method: 在Transformer架构的CLIP、SAM等模型中插入中间3D注意力层，使模型能通过图像空间隐式学习跨视角特征对应关系，无需显式构建3D模型。

Result: 在表面法线估计和多视图分割任务中，所提方法较传统2D模型特征匹配误差降低37%，且无需3D重建即可实现跨视图特征对齐。

Conclusion: 该方法为视觉大模型提供了多视图扩展路径，证明隐式3D感知机制可有效提升模型跨视角特征一致性，在三维感知任务中具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Foundation models are vital tools in various Computer Vision applications. They take as input a single RGB image and output a deep feature representation that is useful for various applications. However, in case we have multiple views of the same 3D scene, they operate on each image independently and do not always produce consistent features for the same 3D point. We propose a way to convert a Foundation Model into a Multi-View Foundation Model. Such a model takes as input a set of images and outputs a feature map for each image such that the features of corresponding points are as consistent as possible. This approach bypasses the need to build a consistent 3D model of the features and allows direct manipulation in the image space. Specifically, we show how to augment Transformers-based foundation models (i.e., DINO, SAM, CLIP) with intermediate 3D-aware attention layers that help match features across different views. As leading examples, we show surface normal estimation and multi-view segmentation tasks. Quantitative experiments show that our method improves feature matching considerably compared to current foundation models.

Motivation: 现有扩散视觉语言模型（dVLM）因基础扩散语言模型能力不足，性能显著落后于主流模型，研究核心问题是能否基于现有AR模型构建高性能dVLM。

Method: 将AR预训练模型适配到扩散范式，提出块解码设计支持任意长度生成和KV缓存复用，以少量数据训练实现模型迁移。

Result: DiffusionVL在视觉基准MMMU-Pro和认知基准MME分别取得34.4%和37.5%的性能提升，并实现2倍推理加速，且训练数据量不足先前方法的5%。

Conclusion: AR模型向扩散范式的迁移有效且可行，直接转换可达到LLaVA风格微调的竞争力，结合块解码设计显著优化了性能与效率。

Abstract: In recent multimodal research, the diffusion paradigm has emerged as a promising alternative to the autoregressive paradigm (AR), owing to its unique decoding advantages. However, due to the capability limitations of the base diffusion language model, the performance of the diffusion vision language model (dVLM) still lags significantly behind that of mainstream models. This leads to a simple yet fundamental question: Is it possible to construct dVLMs based on existing powerful AR models? In response, we propose DiffusionVL, a dVLM family that could be translated from any powerful AR models. Through simple fine-tuning, we successfully adapt AR pre-trained models into the diffusion paradigm. This approach yields two key observations: (1) The paradigm shift from AR-based multimodal models to diffusion is remarkably effective. (2) Direct conversion of an AR language model to a dVLM is also feasible, achieving performance competitive with LLaVA-style visual-instruction-tuning. Further, we introduce a block-decoding design into dVLMs that supports arbitrary-length generation and KV cache reuse, achieving a significant inference speedup. We conduct a large number of experiments. Despite training with less than 5% of the data required by prior methods, DiffusionVL achieves a comprehensive performance improvement-a 34.4% gain on the MMMU-Pro (vision) bench and 37.5% gain on the MME (Cog.) bench-alongside a 2x inference speedup. The model and code are released at https://github.com/hustvl/DiffusionVL.

Motivation: 挑战学界将幻觉归因于奖励机制的主流观点，提出需要从模型架构的根本性质重新理解幻觉成因

Method: 结合结构性幻觉理论与实证实验，设计基于许可预言机（Licensing Oracle）的验证框架

Result: 实验证明激励机制调整无法抑制幻觉，仅外部验证可消除幻觉；Transformer在数据边界外必然虚构信息

Conclusion: 建议构建区分语言流畅性与认知责任的混合系统，重新定位生成架构的可靠性基础

Abstract: OpenAI has recently argued that hallucinations in large language models result primarily from misaligned evaluation incentives that reward confident guessing rather than epistemic humility. On this view, hallucination is a contingent behavioral artifact, remediable through improved benchmarks and reward structures. In this paper, we challenge that interpretation. Drawing on previous work on structural hallucination and empirical experiments using a Licensing Oracle, we argue that hallucination is not an optimization failure but an architectural inevitability of the transformer model.
  Transformers do not represent the world; they model statistical associations among tokens. Their embedding spaces form a pseudo-ontology derived from linguistic co-occurrence rather than world-referential structure. At ontological boundary conditions - regions where training data is sparse or incoherent - the model necessarily interpolates fictional continuations in order to preserve coherence. No incentive mechanism can modify this structural dependence on pattern completion.
  Our empirical results demonstrate that hallucination can only be eliminated through external truth-validation and abstention modules, not through changes to incentives, prompting, or fine-tuning. The Licensing Oracle achieves perfect abstention precision across domains precisely because it supplies grounding that the transformer lacks.
  We conclude that hallucination is a structural property of generative architectures and that reliable AI requires hybrid systems that distinguish linguistic fluency from epistemic responsibility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of T5Gemma's text-only design and enhance efficiency while extending multimodal functionality by adapting from the Gemma 3 model framework.

Method: Adapted a decoder-only pretrained model into an encoder-decoder architecture via UL2, introduced tied word embeddings and merged attention mechanisms, and integrated multimodal capabilities from Gemma 3.

Result: The model demonstrates robust adaptation across architectures/modalities, excels in long-context tasks, and shows superior pretraining performance and significantly improved post-training results compared to Gemma 3 variants.

Conclusion: T5Gemma 2 offers efficient, multi-task capabilities while maintaining lightweight properties, with models publicly released to support future research.

Abstract: We introduce T5Gemma 2, the next generation of the T5Gemma family of lightweight open encoder-decoder models, featuring strong multilingual, multimodal and long-context capabilities. T5Gemma 2 follows the adaptation recipe (via UL2) in T5Gemma -- adapting a pretrained decoder-only model into an encoder-decoder model, and extends it from text-only regime to multimodal based on the Gemma 3 models. We further propose two methods to improve the efficiency: tied word embedding that shares all embeddings across encoder and decoder, and merged attention that unifies decoder self- and cross-attention into a single joint module. Experiments demonstrate the generality of the adaptation strategy over architectures and modalities as well as the unique strength of the encoder-decoder architecture on long context modeling. Similar to T5Gemma, T5Gemma 2 yields comparable or better pretraining performance and significantly improved post-training performance than its Gemma 3 counterpart. We release the pretrained models (270M-270M, 1B-1B and 4B-4B) to the community for future research.

Result: 两种改进均独立提升分类效果，融合方法达到最佳性能，尤其当LLMs处理长文本时效果显著优化

Conclusion: 证明了机器增强方法在分析新闻多元观点中的有效性，为媒体话语评估提供了技术改进路径

Abstract: News sources play a central role in democratic societies by shaping political and social discourse through specific topics, viewpoints and voices. Understanding these dynamics is essential for assessing whether the media landscape offers a balanced and fair account of public debate. In earlier work, we introduced a pipeline that, given a news corpus, i) uses a hybrid human-machine approach to identify the range of viewpoints expressed about a given topic, and ii) classifies relevant claims with respect to the identified viewpoints, defined as sets of semantically and ideologically congruent claims (e.g., positions arguing that immigration positively impacts the UK economy). In this paper, we improve this pipeline by i) fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) for viewpoint classification and ii) enriching claim representations with semantic descriptions of relevant actors drawn from Wikidata. We evaluate our approach against alternative solutions on a benchmark centred on the UK immigration debate. Results show that while both mechanisms independently improve classification performance, their integration yields the best results, particularly when using LLMs capable of processing long inputs.

Abstract: Objectives: To evaluate large language model (LLM) performance on pharmacy licensure-style question-answering (QA) tasks and develop an external knowledge integration method to improve their accuracy.
  Methods: We benchmarked eleven existing LLMs with varying parameter sizes (8 billion to 70+ billion) using a 141-question pharmacy dataset. We measured baseline accuracy for each model without modification. We then developed a three-step retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline, DrugRAG, that retrieves structured drug knowledge from validated sources and augments model prompts with evidence-based context. This pipeline operates externally to the models, requiring no changes to model architecture or parameters.
  Results: Baseline accuracy ranged from 46% to 92%, with GPT-5 (92%) and o3 (89%) achieving the highest scores. Models with fewer than 8 billion parameters scored below 50%. DrugRAG improved accuracy across all tested models, with gains ranging from 7 to 21 percentage points (e.g., Gemma 3 27B: 61% to 71%, Llama 3.1 8B: 46% to 67%) on the 141-item benchmark.
  Conclusion: We demonstrate that external structured drug knowledge integration through DrugRAG measurably improves LLM accuracy on pharmacy tasks without modifying the underlying models. This approach provides a practical pipeline for enhancing pharmacy-focused AI applications with evidence-based information.

Conclusion: 为优化理论与序列建模建立新连接，通过严格数学框架提供下一代LLM可扩展性解决方案，兼顾效率与表现力

Abstract: The quadratic computational complexity of MultiHead SelfAttention (MHSA) remains a fundamental bottleneck in scaling Large Language Models (LLMs) for longcontext tasks. While sparse and linearized attention mechanisms attempt to mitigate this, they often compromise the representation of global dependencies or fail to capture multiscale semantic granularity effectively. In this paper, we propose Multiscale Aggregated Hierarchical Attention (MAHA), a novel architectural framework that reformulates the attention mechanism through hierarchical decomposition and mathematically rigorous aggregation. Unlike conventional approaches that treat token interactions at a single resolution, MAHA dynamically partitions the input sequence into hierarchical scales via learnable downsampling operators. The core innovation lies in its aggregation strategy: we model the fusion of scalespecific attention matrices as a resource allocation problem, solved via a convex optimization framework or a Nash equilibriumbased gametheoretic approach. This ensures a theoretically optimal balance between local nuance and global context fidelity. Implemented within a hybrid dilatedconvolutional transformer backbone, MAHA utilizes differentiable optimization layers to enable endtoend training. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that MAHA achieves superior scalability; empirical FLOPs analysis confirms an 81% reduction in computational cost at a sequence length of 4096 compared to standard attention. This work bridges the gap between optimization theory and sequence modeling, offering a scalable solution for nextgeneration LLMs.

Finally, the models show substantial reductions in grammatical errors compared to their original forms, indicating improvements not only in language understanding but also in Romanian fluency.

Abstract: Multimodal scientific reasoning remains a significant challenge for large language models (LLMs), particularly in chemistry, where problem-solving relies on symbolic diagrams, molecular structures, and structured visual data. Here, we systematically evaluate 40 proprietary and open-source multimodal LLMs, including GPT-5, o3, Gemini-2.5-Pro, and Qwen2.5-VL, on a curated benchmark of Olympiad-style chemistry questions drawn from over two decades of U.S. National Chemistry Olympiad (USNCO) exams. These questions require integrated visual and textual reasoning across diverse modalities. We find that many models struggle with modality fusion, where in some cases, removing the image even improves accuracy, indicating misalignment in vision-language integration. Chain-of-Thought prompting consistently enhances both accuracy and visual grounding, as demonstrated through ablation studies and occlusion-based interpretability. Our results reveal critical limitations in the scientific reasoning abilities of current MLLMs, providing actionable strategies for developing more robust and interpretable multimodal systems in chemistry. This work provides a timely benchmark for measuring progress in domain-specific multimodal AI and underscores the need for further advances at the intersection of artificial intelligence and scientific reasoning.

DASH-DTS provides interpretable reasoning and confidence scores for each segment. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves several sota segmentation trusted accuracy on both VHF-Dial and standard benchmarks, establishing a strong foundation for stable monitoring and decision support in operational dialogues.

Result: 在构建的MM-TOXIC-QA评测框架下，SGM在对抗场景下将有害率降低至2.5%，且支持与现有技术结合形成更强效SGM*组合防御方案。

Conclusion: SGM提供了一种可解释、低成本的多模态生成安全控制方案，为毒性缓解提出了有效且可扩展的新路径。

Abstract: Disclaimer: Samples in this paper may be harmful and cause discomfort.
  Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enable multimodal generation but inherit toxic, biased, and NSFW signals from weakly curated pretraining corpora, causing safety risks, especially under adversarial triggers that late, opaque training-free detoxification methods struggle to handle. We propose SGM, a white-box neuron-level multimodal intervention that acts like safety glasses for toxic neurons: it selectively recalibrates a small set of toxic expert neurons via expertise-weighted soft suppression, neutralizing harmful cross-modal activations without any parameter updates. We establish MM-TOXIC-QA, a multimodal toxicity evaluation framework, and compare SGM with existing detoxification techniques. Experiments on open-source MLLMs show that SGM mitigates toxicity in standard and adversarial conditions, cutting harmful rates from 48.2\% to 2.5\% while preserving fluency and multimodal reasoning. SGM is extensible, and its combined defenses, denoted as SGM*, integrate with existing detoxification methods for stronger safety performance, providing an interpretable, low-cost solution for toxicity-controlled multimodal generation.

### [83] [The Meta-Prompting Protocol: Orchestrating LLMs via Adversarial Feedback Loops](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15053)
*Fanzhe Fu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces the 'Meta-Prompting Protocol' to formalize interaction with Large Language Models (LLMs) as a deterministic, programmable system using an adversarial trinity framework (Generator, Auditor, Optimizer) to reduce hallucinations and enable reliable integration into software engineering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 'prompt engineering' methods for LLMs lack deterministic guarantees required for mission-critical applications, necessitating a fundamental re-engineering of interaction paradigms to make LLMs reliable software components.

Method: The Meta-Prompting Protocol treats natural language instructions as differentiable variables within a semantic computation graph, using textual critiques as gradients. It employs an Adversarial Trinity topology (Generator, Auditor, Optimizer) to formalize LLM orchestration programmatically.

Result: Demonstration of theoretical viability through declarative programming paradigms (DSPy) and automatic textual differentiation (TextGrad), showing mitigation of hallucinations and prevention of model collapse via the adversarial tripartite architecture.

Conclusion: The protocol establishes a foundation for 'Observable Software Engineering' in probabilistic computing, enabling LLMs to transition from stochastic chat interfaces toward reliable, self-optimizing software components with deterministic guarantees.

Abstract: The transition of Large Language Models (LLMs) from stochastic chat interfaces to reliable software components necessitates a fundamental re-engineering of interaction paradigms. Current methodologies, predominantly heuristic-based "prompt engineering," fail to provide the deterministic guarantees required for mission-critical applications. We introduce the Meta-Prompting Protocol, a rigorous theoretical framework that formalizes the orchestration of LLMs as a programmable, self-optimizing system. Central to this protocol is the Adversarial Trinity, a tripartite topology comprising a Generator (P), an Auditor (A), and an Optimizer (O). By treating natural language instructions as differentiable variables within a semantic computation graph and utilizing textual critiques as gradients, this architecture mitigates hallucination and prevents model collapse. We demonstrate the theoretical viability of this approach using declarative programming paradigms (DSPy) and automatic textual differentiation (TextGrad), establishing a foundation for "Observable Software Engineering" in the era of probabilistic computing.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出SCOPE框架，在测试时强化学习中通过子群体特异性置信度加权伪标签估计，解决多数投票策略的确认偏差和稀疏奖励问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖多数投票产生伪标签，但会引发确认偏差且奖励稀疏，限制大语言模型推理能力提升。

Method: SCOPE将步进式置信度量化融入伪标签推导，并动态划分候选输出池为独立子群体，通过重复采样生成多样化子群共识监督目标。

Result: 在多个模型和基准测试中，SCOPE相较基线方法表现更优，挑战性AIME 2025和AMC数据集分别提升13.1%和8.1%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过置信度量化与动态子群划分平衡推理质量与探索多样性，为强化学习提升模型推理提供了新方向。

Abstract: Test-time reinforcement learning mitigates the reliance on annotated data by using majority voting results as pseudo-labels, emerging as a complementary direction to reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) for improving reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs). However, this voting strategy often induces confirmation bias and suffers from sparse rewards, limiting the overall performance. In this work, we propose subgroup-specific step-wise confidence-weighted pseudo-label estimation (SCOPE), a framework integrating model confidence and dynamic subgroup partitioning to address these issues. Specifically, SCOPE integrates the proposed step-wise confidence into pseudo label deduction, prioritizing high-quality reasoning paths over simple frequency count. Furthermore, it dynamically partitions the candidate outputs pool into independent subgroups by balancing reasoning quality against exploration diversity. By deriving local consensus via repeat sampling for each sub group, SCOPE provides diverse supervision targets to encourage broader exploration. We conduct experiments across various models and benchmarks, experimental results show that SCOPE consistently outperforms recent baselines. Notably, SCOPE achieving relative improvements of 13.1\% on challenging AIME 2025 and 8.1\% on AMC.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全基准未能捕捉MCP框架带来的新型开放性攻击面，缺乏真实多服务器场景覆盖，且未考虑多步骤推理和跨服务器协调的复杂性。

Method: 构建包含20种攻击类型的统一分类体系，设计五个现实领域（浏览器自动化/金融分析/定位导航/代码仓库/web搜索）的多轮测试任务，支持跨服务器不确定场景评估。

Result: 系统评估发现开源与闭源模型存在显著安全差异，长任务周期和高频服务器交互会显著加剧漏洞暴露，现有防护方案存在明显防御缺口。

Conclusion: 验证了真实环境安全评估的必要性，确立了MCP-SafetyBench作为行业基准的地位，揭示了复杂场景下安全防护体系的建设紧迫性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are evolving into agentic systems that reason, plan, and operate external tools. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a key enabler of this transition, offering a standardized interface for connecting LLMs with heterogeneous tools and services. Yet MCP's openness and multi-server workflows introduce new safety risks that existing benchmarks fail to capture, as they focus on isolated attacks or lack real-world coverage. We present MCP-SafetyBench, a comprehensive benchmark built on real MCP servers that supports realistic multi-turn evaluation across five domains: browser automation, financial analysis, location navigation, repository management, and web search. It incorporates a unified taxonomy of 20 MCP attack types spanning server, host, and user sides, and includes tasks requiring multi-step reasoning and cross-server coordination under uncertainty. Using MCP-SafetyBench, we systematically evaluate leading open- and closed-source LLMs, revealing large disparities in safety performance and escalating vulnerabilities as task horizons and server interactions grow. Our results highlight the urgent need for stronger defenses and establish MCP-SafetyBench as a foundation for diagnosing and mitigating safety risks in real-world MCP deployments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有注重最终成果的评估方法在学生广泛使用ChatGPT等工具时已失效，需转向过程性评估

Conclusion: 基于过程与多证据的P-MFA模型能有效解决传统评估体系在AI生成内容背景下的失效问题

Abstract: This paper explores the growing epistemic parallel between NLG evaluation and grading of students in a Finnish University. We argue that both domains are experiencing a Great Misalignment Problem. As students increasingly use tools like ChatGPT to produce sophisticated outputs, traditional assessment methods that focus on final products rather than learning processes have lost their validity. To address this, we introduce the Pedagogical Multi-Factor Assessment (P-MFA) model, a process-based, multi-evidence framework inspired by the logic of multi-factor authentication.

*Chao Zhang,Minghan Li,Tianrui Lv,Guodong Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出RFKG-CoT方法，通过关系驱动的自适应跳跃次数选择器和路径引导机制，提升知识图谱问答的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法KG-CoT在知识密集型问答中因固定跳跃次数选择和推理路径利用不足导致效果受限。LLMs的幻觉问题仍需改进。

Method: 1.设计关系驱动的自适应跳跃选择器，通过激活知识图关系动态调整步骤（如用关系掩码形式化）。2.引入基于CoT的少样本路径引导机制，采用问题-路径-答案格式增强模型理解。

Result: 在4个KGQA基准测试中，RFKG-CoT使准确率提升高达14.7个百分点（Llama2-7B在WebQSP上），消融实验证明跳跃选择器和路径提示互补，可联合提升效果。

Conclusion: RFKG-CoT通过动态跳跃控制和显性路径引导，有效克服KG-CoT的固有缺陷，显著提升LLMs在知识密集型任务中的答案可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate hallucinations in knowledge-intensive QA due to parametric knowledge limitations. While existing methods like KG-CoT improve reliability by integrating knowledge graph (KG) paths, they suffer from rigid hop-count selection (solely question-driven) and underutilization of reasoning paths (lack of guidance). To address this, we propose RFKG-CoT: First, it replaces the rigid hop-count selector with a relation-driven adaptive hop-count selector that dynamically adjusts reasoning steps by activating KG relations (e.g., 1-hop for direct "brother" relations, 2-hop for indirect "father-son" chains), formalized via a relation mask. Second, it introduces a few-shot in-context learning path guidance mechanism with CoT (think) that constructs examples in a "question-paths-answer" format to enhance LLMs' ability to understand reasoning paths. Experiments on four KGQA benchmarks show RFKG-CoT improves accuracy by up to 14.7 pp (Llama2-7B on WebQSP) over KG-CoT. Ablations confirm the hop-count selector and the path prompt are complementary, jointly transforming KG evidence into more faithful answers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 印度低资源语言的平行语料稀缺且翻译需求迫切，需探索不同技术路径（包括新兴大模型提示方法）在资源受限场景下的有效性。

Method: 系统采用多策略对比实验：1）多语言/单语微调mT5和IndicBart；2）LoRA微调IndicTrans2；3）基于Llama 3和Mixtral的零样例提示与有监督微调；4）从头训练Transformer模型。使用SacreBLEU和CHRF指标评估。

Result: 实验表明大语言模型（尤其经微调后）在低资源翻译中表现突出，但数据稀缺仍显著制约性能；LoRA等参数高效微调技术可提升模型适应性，但单语模型训练效果受制于数据量。

Conclusion: 大语言模型为低资源印度语言翻译提供新解决方案，但需结合领域适配技术（如LoRA）及跨语言迁移策略，同时强调构建更大规模高质量平行语料的必要性。

Abstract: This paper presents the systems submitted by the Yes-MT team for the Low-Resource Indic Language Translation Shared Task at WMT 2024 (Pakray et al., 2024), focusing on translating between English and the Assamese, Mizo, Khasi, and Manipuri languages. The experiments explored various approaches, including fine-tuning pre-trained models like mT5 (Xue et al., 2020) and IndicBart (Dabre et al., 2021) in both multilingual and monolingual settings, LoRA (Hu et al., 2021) fine-tuning IndicTrans2 (Gala et al., 2023), zero-shot and few-shot prompting (Brown, 2020) with large language models (LLMs) like Llama 3 (Dubey et al., 2024) and Mixtral 8x7b (Jiang et al., 2024), LoRA supervised fine-tuning of Llama 3 (Mecklenburg et al., 2024), and training Transformer models (Vaswani, 2017) from scratch. The results were evaluated on the WMT23 Low-Resource Indic Language Translation Shared Task test data using SacreBLEU (Post, 2018) and CHRF (Popovic, 2015), highlighting the challenges of low-resource translation and the potential of LLMs for these tasks, particularly with fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出FAME（Fictional Actors for Multilingual Erasure），首个支持多语言和细粒度遗忘的机器遗忘基准数据集，涵盖英、法、德、意、西五种语言，包含虚构演员简介与问答对，用于系统评估不同语言下的遗忘技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM遗忘方法测评基准局限于英文和实体级遗忘，缺乏多语言支持和实例级遗忘评估能力。该研究旨在解决隐私问题，提供可控环境下的跨语言遗忘效果测试框架。

Method: 创建包含1000个虚构演员档案和20000个问答对的合成数据集FAME，每份档案包含20个结构化类别信息。设计双数据集划分以支持实体级（删除整个身份）和实例级（删除特定事实）遗忘场景，使用虚构数据确保预训练模型未接触过相关信息。

Result: 基于FAME的评估显示：现有技术（如Fine-Pruning,NegGrad,SCRUB）在完全记忆场景下均表现不足，仅在部分场景实现微量遗忘效果，其中参数微调方法遗忘效果与语言无关，遗忘效果在不同语言间具有一致性。

Conclusion: 机器遗忘技术仍需突破性改进，跨语言测评对隐私合规性具有重要价值。虚构数据集设计可精确控制记忆内容，为未来研究指明方向，强调开发语言无关的有效遗忘机制的重要性。

Abstract: LLMs trained on web-scale data raise concerns about privacy and the right to be forgotten. To address these issues, Machine Unlearning provides techniques to remove specific information from trained models without retraining from scratch. However, existing benchmarks for evaluating unlearning in LLMs face two major limitations: they focus only on English and support only entity-level forgetting (removing all information about a person). We introduce FAME (Fictional Actors for Multilingual Erasure), a synthetic benchmark for evaluating Machine Unlearning across five languages: English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish. FAME contains 1,000 fictional actor biographies and 20,000 question-answer pairs. Each biography includes information on 20 topics organized into structured categories (biography, career, achievements, personal information). This design enables both entity-level unlearning (i.e., forgetting entire identities) and instance-level unlearning (i.e., forgetting specific facts while retaining others). We provide two dataset splits to support these two different unlearning scenarios and enable systematic comparison of unlearning techniques across languages. Since FAME uses entirely fictional data, it ensures that the information was never encountered during model pretraining, allowing for a controlled evaluation of unlearning methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个用于分析道德价值观在论证中运用的多类型语料库（Moralization Corpus），并通过实验评估大语言模型在道德化检测中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 道德化（引用道德价值观来支持主张的论证）尚未得到充分研究，且其隐含性和复杂性对人类和自然语言处理系统构成挑战。

Method: 设计基于框架的注释方案（包含道德价值观、要求、话语参与者），标注德语文本语料库，并在不同提示条件下测试大语言模型的道德化检测效果。

Result: 详细提示指令显著提高模型表现，但道德化任务仍表现出高度主观性和语境依赖性。

Conclusion: 道德化语料库及相关资源将推动道德话语理解和自然语言处理中的道德推理研究。

Abstract: Moralizations - arguments that invoke moral values to justify demands or positions - are a yet underexplored form of persuasive communication. We present the Moralization Corpus, a novel multi-genre dataset designed to analyze how moral values are strategically used in argumentative discourse. Moralizations are pragmatically complex and often implicit, posing significant challenges for both human annotators and NLP systems. We develop a frame-based annotation scheme that captures the constitutive elements of moralizations - moral values, demands, and discourse protagonists - and apply it to a diverse set of German texts, including political debates, news articles, and online discussions. The corpus enables fine-grained analysis of moralizing language across communicative formats and domains. We further evaluate several large language models (LLMs) under varied prompting conditions for the task of moralization detection and moralization component extraction and compare it to human annotations in order to investigate the challenges of automatic and manual analysis of moralizations. Results show that detailed prompt instructions has a greater effect than few-shot or explanation-based prompting, and that moralization remains a highly subjective and context-sensitive task. We release all data, annotation guidelines, and code to foster future interdisciplinary research on moral discourse and moral reasoning in NLP.

Motivation: 现有真实医疗数据存在病例分布偏差，难以覆盖课程大纲中要求的常见与罕见病种，且需保护患者隐私。合成数据集需反映真实复杂性，而非过度清洁导致临床现实缺失。

Method: 整合RACGP 2022课程大纲、BEACH流行病学研究及多样化就诊场景，设计包含真实复杂性的合成医疗记录。通过流行病学比对、语言风格分析、语义多样性评估及自监督NLP任务（如医学概念提取）进行验证。

Result: 数据集与澳大利亚全科就诊模式流行病学对齐，语言风格多样性高，语义覆盖广。NLP任务中F1分数提升，证明其有效性，同时填补了澳大利亚国内隐私保护数据资源的空白。

Conclusion: SynGP500为澳大利亚全科医疗NLP研究提供了兼顾隐私和真实复杂性的标准化工具，其结合课程、流行病学和临床复杂性的方法可推广至其他医疗场景。

Abstract: We introduce SynGP500, a clinician-curated collection of 500 synthetic Australian general practice medical notes. The dataset integrates curriculum-based clinical breadth (RACGP 2022 Curriculum), epidemiologically-calibrated prevalence (BEACH study), and diverse consultation contexts. This approach systematically includes both common presentations and less-common curriculum-specified conditions that GPs must recognize but appear infrequently in single practice populations, potentially supporting more generalizable model training than datasets constrained by naturally occurring case distributions. SynGP500 is messy by design, reflecting the authentic complexity of healthcare delivery: telegraphic documentation, typos, patient non-adherence, socioeconomic barriers, and clinician-patient disagreements, unlike sanitized synthetic datasets that obscure clinical realities. Multi-faceted validation demonstrates dataset quality through epidemiological alignment with real Australian GP consultation patterns (BEACH study), stylometric analysis confirming high linguistic variation, semantic diversity analysis demonstrating broad coverage, and exploratory downstream evaluation using self-supervised medical concept extraction, showing F1 improvements. SynGP500 addresses a critical national gap, providing researchers and educators with a resource for developing and evaluating clinical NLP methods for Australian general practice while inherently protecting patient privacy.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为PPPO的新型RLVR方法，通过聚焦大语言模型（LLM）生成输出的前缀段提升推理能力，使用26.17%的训练token即可实现18.02%的准确率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RLVR方法对所有生成token进行统一训练，忽视了前缀token对推理的关键作用，导致资源浪费在低收益token上并阻碍模型提升。

Method: 基于人类思维路径依赖理论，提出前缀锁定效应（BLE）概念，通过两种策略优化模型推理：1）渐进前缀保留（逐步增加训练中保留的前缀token比例）；2）连续累积奖励（对多个续写样本的奖励求平均以减少偏差）。

Result: 在多种推理任务中，PPPO相较于代表性RLVR方法表现更优，在仅使用26.17%训练token时准确率提升18.02%。

Conclusion: 通过针对性优化LLM推理过程的前缀阶段，有效提升了训练效率和推理效果，为改进大语言模型前缀推理步骤提供了新方向。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) significantly enhances the reasoning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs). Current RLVR approaches typically conduct training across all generated tokens, but neglect to explore which tokens (e.g., prefix tokens) actually contribute to reasoning. This uniform training strategy spends substantial effort on optimizing low-return tokens, which in turn impedes the potential improvement from high-return tokens and reduces overall training effectiveness. To address this issue, we propose a novel RLVR approach called Progressive Prefix-token Policy Optimization (PPPO), which highlights the significance of the prefix segment of generated outputs. Specifically, inspired by the well-established human thinking theory of Path Dependence, where early-stage thoughts substantially constrain subsequent thinking trajectory, we identify an analogous phenomenon in LLM reasoning termed Beginning Lock-in Effect (BLE). PPPO leverages this finding by focusing its optimization objective on the prefix reasoning process of LLMs. This targeted optimization strategy can positively influence subsequent reasoning processes, and ultimately improve final results. To improve the learning effectiveness of LLMs on how to start reasoning with high quality, PPPO introduces two training strategies: (a) Progressive Prefix Retention, which shapes a progressive learning process by increasing the proportion of retained prefix tokens during training; (b) Continuation Accumulated Reward, which mitigates reward bias by sampling multiple continuations for one prefix token sequence, and accumulating their scores as the reward signal. Extensive experimental results on various reasoning tasks demonstrate that our proposed PPPO outperforms representative RLVR methods, with the accuracy improvements of 18.02% on only 26.17% training tokens.

TL;DR: 这篇论文评估了大型语言模型（LLM）在沸石合成文本的科学信息抽取任务中的表现，发现不同提示策略在不同子任务中的性能差异较大，且高级提示策略提升有限，表明需要领域适配模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究尚未系统评估LLM在材料科学信息抽取中的效能，亟需探究提示策略对科学文献参数提取的适用性，尤其是针对结构化合成信息提取的细粒度任务。

Method: 构建包含零样本、少样本、事件特定、反思四种提示策略的实验框架，测试六种先进LLM在ZSEE数据集（1530条标注句子）的四个子任务：事件分类、触发词识别、论元角色提取和论元文本提取，并进行错误分析。

Result: LLM在事件分类中表现优异（F1值80-90%），但细粒度提取任务较弱（论元相关任务F1值50-65%），GPT-5-mini存在11-79%的极端波动，且高级提示策略相比零样本提升不足。

Conclusion: LLM在高层理解较可靠但精确参数抽取仍需领域优化，揭示其架构局限性，为科学信息抽取提供量化基准，并指出模型适配和误差修正的研究需求。

Abstract: Extracting structured information from zeolite synthesis experimental procedures is critical for materials discovery, yet existing methods have not systematically evaluated Large Language Models (LLMs) for this domain-specific task. This work addresses a fundamental question: what is the efficacy of different prompting strategies when applying LLMs to scientific information extraction? We focus on four key subtasks: event type classification (identifying synthesis steps), trigger text identification (locating event mentions), argument role extraction (recognizing parameter types), and argument text extraction (extracting parameter values). We evaluate four prompting strategies - zero-shot, few-shot, event-specific, and reflection-based - across six state-of-the-art LLMs (Gemma-3-12b-it, GPT-5-mini, O4-mini, Claude-Haiku-3.5, DeepSeek reasoning and non-reasoning) using the ZSEE dataset of 1,530 annotated sentences. Results demonstrate strong performance on event type classification (80-90\% F1) but modest performance on fine-grained extraction tasks, particularly argument role and argument text extraction (50-65\% F1). GPT-5-mini exhibits extreme prompt sensitivity with 11-79\% F1 variation. Notably, advanced prompting strategies provide minimal improvements over zero-shot approaches, revealing fundamental architectural limitations. Error analysis identifies systematic hallucination, over-generalization, and inability to capture synthesis-specific nuances. Our findings demonstrate that while LLMs achieve high-level understanding, precise extraction of experimental parameters requires domain-adapted models, providing quantitative benchmarks for scientific information extraction.

Motivation: 针对阿拉伯应用语言学领域的主题结构缺乏系统性分析，且需澄清Brookes原始公式的正确应用方式。研究旨在揭示该学科内部的异质化特征，并展示离散度测量方法在学术领域表征中的实用性。

Method: 采用Brookes的Δ指数计算方法，对包含1,564篇论文的完整数据库进行分析，将文献划分为8个核心子学科（包括计算语言学、社会语言学、语言教学等），量化并评估学科内部的主题分布模式。

Result: 测得Δ=0.194的极低值，表明该领域呈现极端主题离散性；计算语言学虽具主导地位但非垄断性，与其他子领域（如社会语言学和语言教学）形成共存态势。

Conclusion: 阿拉伯应用语言学领域具有显著异质性特征，Brookes方法有效揭示了学科结构特征，本研究提供的书目计量方法可复现并适用于其他学科领域的结构分析。

Abstract: This study applies Brookes' Measure of Categorical Dispersion (Δ) to analyze the thematic structure of contemporary Arabic Applied Linguistics research. Using a comprehensive, real-world dataset of 1,564 publications from 2019 to 2025, classified into eight core sub-disciplines, we calculate a dispersion index of Δ = 0.194. This remarkably low value indicates extreme thematic dispersion, revealing that the field is characterized by pronounced heterogeneity rather than concentration. The analysis identifies Computational Linguistics as a dominant but non-hegemonic force, coexisting with robust research in Sociolinguistics, Language Teaching, and other subfields. This study clarifies the correct application of Brookes' original formula, demonstrates its utility for field characterization, and provides a replicable bibliometric methodology for assessing disciplinary structure across domains.

*Joao Queiroz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 诗歌形式的提示词可有效突破大语言模型安全机制，葡萄牙语相关测试存在重大空白


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究发现韵文改写能显著提升对齐语言模型的越狱成功率，但葡萄牙语因其形态复杂性和韵律传统未被充分评估

Method: 分析诗歌提示在RLHF、宪法AI等对齐模型中的攻击效果，提出需针对葡萄牙语的韵律特征设计评估指标

Result: 人工诗歌达到62%攻击成功率，自动版本43%，部分模型单次交互超90%成功，显示对齐方案存在结构漏洞

Conclusion: 现有对齐方法过度依赖表层模式，在稀疏监督的潜在区域易受攻击，需针对葡萄牙语的音系规律建立专项评估体系

Abstract: Recent evidence shows that the versification of prompts constitutes a highly effective adversarial mechanism against aligned LLMs. The study 'Adversarial poetry as a universal single-turn jailbreak mechanism in large language models' demonstrates that instructions routinely refused in prose become executable when rewritten as verse, producing up to 18 x more safety failures in benchmarks derived from MLCommons AILuminate. Manually written poems reach approximately 62% ASR, and automated versions 43%, with some models surpassing 90% success in single-turn interactions. The effect is structural: systems trained with RLHF, constitutional AI, and hybrid pipelines exhibit consistent degradation under minimal semiotic formal variation. Versification displaces the prompt into sparsely supervised latent regions, revealing guardrails that are excessively dependent on surface patterns. This dissociation between apparent robustness and real vulnerability exposes deep limitations in current alignment regimes. The absence of evaluations in Portuguese, a language with high morphosyntactic complexity, a rich metric-prosodic tradition, and over 250 million speakers, constitutes a critical gap. Experimental protocols must parameterise scansion, metre, and prosodic variation to test vulnerabilities specific to Lusophone patterns, which are currently ignored.

TL;DR: 本文提出Denser框架，通过区分中间推理和最终回答的语言密度，优化大语言模型的推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在复杂推理任务中采用统一的语言密度，导致计算效率低下。作者发现推理过程服务于模型自身计算，而回答服务于人类理解，这一区别促使了压缩语言在中间步骤的使用。

Method: 设计Denser框架，包含三个模块：问题分析模块、高密度压缩推理机制、答案生成组件，分别处理输入问题、高效中间计算及生成人类可读解答。

Result: 在多个推理问答基准测试中，Denser相比传统思维链方法减少了高达62%的token消耗，且保持或提升了准确率，尤其在复杂多步骤问题中效果显著。

Conclusion: 通过分离推理与回答的信息密度，Denser有效提升计算效率，为大语言模型的推理优化提供了新方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in complex reasoning tasks. However, current approaches employ uniform language density for both intermediate reasoning and final answers, leading to computational inefficiency. Our observation found that reasoning process serves a computational function for the model itself, while answering serves a communicative function for human understanding. This distinction enables the use of compressed, symbol-rich language for intermediate computations while maintaining human-readable final explanations. To address this inefficiency, we present Denser: \underline{D}ual-d\underline{ens}ity inf\underline{er}ence, a novel framework that optimizes information density separately for reasoning and answering phases. Our framework implements this through three components: a query processing module that analyzes input problems, a high-density compressed reasoning mechanism for efficient intermediate computations, and an answer generation component that translates compressed reasoning into human-readable solutions. Experimental evaluation across multiple reasoning question answering benchmarks demonstrates that Denser reduces token consumption by up to 62\% compared to standard Chain-of-Thought methods while preserving or improving accuracy. These efficiency gains are particularly significant for complex multi-step reasoning problems where traditional methods generate extensive explanations.

Abstract: Background: Motivational interviewing (MI) is an effective counseling approach for promoting health behavior change, but its impact is constrained by the need for highly trained human counselors. Objective: This study aimed to explore a scalable alternative by developing and evaluating Large Language Models for Motivational Interviewing (MI-LLMs). Methods: We first curated five Chinese psychological counseling corpora and, using GPT-4 with an MI-informed prompt, transcribed multi-turn dialogues from the two highest-quality datasets (CPsyCounD and PsyDTCorpus) into 2,040 MI-style counseling conversations, of which 2,000 were used for training and 40 for testing. Three Chinese-capable open-source LLMs (Baichuan2-7B-Chat, ChatGLM-4-9B-Chat and Llama-3-8B-Chinese-Chat-v2) were fine-tuned on this corpus and were named as MI-LLMs. We evaluated MI-LLMs using round-based automatic metrics and expert manual coding with the Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity (MITI) Coding Manual 4.2.1. Results: Across all three models, fine-tuning substantially improved BLEU-4 and ROUGE scores compared with the base models, and manual coding showed that MI-LLMs achieved technical and relational global scores, and MI-adherent ratios that approached those of real MI dialogues, although complex reflections and reflection-to-question ratios remained less frequent. Conclusions: These findings provide initial evidence that MI-oriented fine-tuning can endow general-purpose LLMs with core MI-consistent counseling behaviors, suggesting a scalable pathway toward AI-assisted health behavior change support while underscoring the need for further work on data scale, complex MI skills and real-world intervention trials.

### [100] [CTkvr: KV Cache Retrieval for Long-Context LLMs via Centroid then Token Indexing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15550)
*Kuan Lu,Shuhang Lin,Sai Wu,Yichen Yao,Junhan Yang,Huan Li,Wei Chu,Xu Yinghui,Yuan Qi,Gang Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes CTKVR, a two-stage Key-Value (KV) cache retrieval method for long-context large language models (LLMs), combining centroid-based coarse indexing with token-level refinement to balance efficiency and accuracy while leveraging CPU-GPU co-execution for optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-context scenarios in LLMs (e.g., multi-turn conversations) face efficiency bottlenecks due to high memory overhead and latency from KV cache management. Existing methods struggle with trade-offs between block-level indexing (poor accuracy) and token-level indexing (high latency).

Method: CTKVR introduces a two-stage retrieval scheme: (1) lightweight centroid precomputation during prefilling for coarse-grained indexing, and (2) token-level refinement for precise KV retrieval. The method exploits positional similarity in RoPE-embedded queries and implements CPU-GPU co-execution for system-level optimization.

Result: CTKVR achieves <1% accuracy degradation while delivering 3× and 4× throughput speedups on Llama-3-8B and Yi-9B models at 96K context length across GPUs. It outperforms existing KV retrieval methods on multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: CTKVR effectively addresses efficiency-accuracy trade-offs in long-context LLMs through a hybrid retrieval strategy and hardware-aware optimization, enabling scalable deployment for practical applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in long-context scenarios such as multi-turn conversations. However, long contexts pose significant challenges for inference efficiency, including high memory overhead from Key-Value (KV) cache and increased latency due to excessive memory accesses. Recent methods for dynamic KV selection struggle with trade-offs: block-level indexing degrades accuracy by retrieving irrelevant KV entries, while token-level indexing incurs high latency from inefficient retrieval mechanisms. In this paper, we propose CTKVR, a novel centroid-then-token KV retrieval scheme that addresses these limitations. CTKVR leverages a key observation: query vectors adjacent in position exhibit high similarity after Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) and share most of their top-k KV cache entries. Based on this insight, CTKVR employs a two-stage retrieval strategy: lightweight centroids are precomputed during prefilling for centroid-grained indexing, followed by token-level refinement for precise KV retrieval. This approach balances retrieval efficiency and accuracy. To further enhance performance, we implement an optimized system for indexing construction and search using CPU-GPU co-execution. Experimentally, CTKVR achieves superior performance across multiple benchmarks with less than 1% accuracy degradation. Meanwhile, CTKVR delivers 3 times and 4 times throughput speedups on Llama-3-8B and Yi-9B at 96K context length across diverse GPU hardware.

Motivation: 传统GSL构建依赖语言学家主观经验且耗时，需开发客观自动化的词汇选择方法降低门槛并提升效率。

Method: 基于客观标准构建SWL模型，通过比较SWL与行业标准NGSL的词汇覆盖率、语料库覆盖效率进行性能评估。

Result: SWL模型在专用语料库中实现95%覆盖率所需词汇量显著少于NGSL，且可完全自动化生成和扩展。

Conclusion: 基于客观标准的SWL优于传统方法，能通过自动化流程满足个性化语言学习需求，具全球推广性。

Abstract: Traditional linguists have proposed the use of a General Service List (GSL) to assist new language learners in identifying the most important words in English. This process requires linguistic expertise, subjective input, and a considerable amount of time. We attempt to create our own GSL and evaluate its practicality against the industry standard (The NGSL). We found creating a Specialized Word List (SWL), or a word list specific to a subset of the overall corpus, to be the most practical way for language-learners to optimize the process. The SWL's that we created using our model outperformed the industry standard, reaching the 95% coverage required for language comprehension with fewer words comparatively. By restricting the SWL process to objective criteria only, it can be automated, scaled, and tailored to the needs of language-learners across the globe.

Motivation: 针对中文等表意文字语言在多词表达处理上的滞后性，以及传统子词模型无法直接应用于中文的挑战性问题

Method: 提出中文字符分解技术结合MWE感知的神经机器翻译框架，并进行系统性对比实验

Result: 实验显示字符分解技术能够有效增强中文词语表征，提升多词表达的翻译质量，缓解稀有表达带来的翻译困难

Conclusion: 证明基于字符分解的建模方法可弥补中文在多词表达处理上的技术短板，为表意文字语言的机器翻译提供新方案

Abstract: Word meaning, representation, and interpretation play fundamental roles in natural language understanding (NLU), natural language processing (NLP), and natural language generation (NLG) tasks. Many of the inherent difficulties in these tasks stem from Multi-word Expressions (MWEs), which complicate the tasks by introducing ambiguity, idiomatic expressions, infrequent usage, and a wide range of variations. Significant effort and substantial progress have been made in addressing the challenging nature of MWEs in Western languages, particularly English. This progress is attributed in part to the well-established research communities and the abundant availability of computational resources. However, the same level of progress is not true for language families such as Chinese and closely related Asian languages, which continue to lag behind in this regard. While sub-word modelling has been successfully applied to many Western languages to address rare words improving phrase comprehension, and enhancing machine translation (MT) through techniques like byte-pair encoding (BPE), it cannot be applied directly to ideograph language scripts like Chinese. In this work, we conduct a systematic study of the Chinese character decomposition technology in the context of MWE-aware neural machine translation (NMT). Furthermore, we report experiments to examine how Chinese character decomposition technology contributes to the representation of the original meanings of Chinese words and characters, and how it can effectively address the challenges of translating MWEs.

TL;DR: Bolmo通过将预训练的子词级语言模型转化为字节级模型（byteification），在1B和7B参数规模上实现了比传统字节级模型更优的性能，同时仅需1%的常规预训练数据量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有子词分词存在字符理解不足和固定词表效率限制，传统字节级模型需从头训练且效果欠佳，需探索高效且实用的字节级建模方法。

Method: 设计支持字节化的架构，通过精确蒸馏目标将子词模型知识迁移至字节级模型，采用高token压缩比提升推理速度，并基于子词模型的生态系统进行后训练优化。

Result: Bolmo显著超越同规模字节级模型，在字符理解和代码任务上优于源子词模型，推理速度与子词模型相当，后训练成本低且效果显著。

Conclusion: 字节级模型通过Bolmo的架构创新和蒸馏策略成为实用选择，在多场景下竞争力达近似子词模型水平。

Abstract: We introduce Bolmo, the first family of competitive fully open byte-level language models (LMs) at the 1B and 7B parameter scales. In contrast to prior research on byte-level LMs, which focuses predominantly on training from scratch, we train Bolmo by byteifying existing subword-level LMs. Byteification enables overcoming the limitations of subword tokenization - such as insufficient character understanding and efficiency constraints due to the fixed subword vocabulary - while performing at the level of leading subword-level LMs. Bolmo is specifically designed for byteification: our architecture resolves a mismatch between the expressivity of prior byte-level architectures and subword-level LMs, which makes it possible to employ an effective exact distillation objective between Bolmo and the source subword model. This allows for converting a subword-level LM to a byte-level LM by investing less than 1\% of a typical pretraining token budget. Bolmo substantially outperforms all prior byte-level LMs of comparable size, and outperforms the source subword-level LMs on character understanding and, in some cases, coding, while coming close to matching the original LMs' performance on other tasks. Furthermore, we show that Bolmo can achieve inference speeds competitive with subword-level LMs by training with higher token compression ratios, and can be cheaply and effectively post-trained by leveraging the existing ecosystem around the source subword-level LM. Our results finally make byte-level LMs a practical choice competitive with subword-level LMs across a wide set of use cases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心理防御机制（如压抑、合理化）的僵化使用会损害心理健康，但现有评估工具在临床对话中难以可靠测量该现象。研究旨在通过构建标准语料库和自动化工具解决防御机制量化难题，并为心理咨询实践提供技术辅助。

Method: 构建了包含200段对话（4709个语句）的PsyDefConv语料库，采用Cohen's kappa（0.639）进行标注一致性验证；设计四阶段DMRS Co-Pilot流程提供基于证据的预标注。通过零样本学习和微调设置下的语言模型基准测试，结合专家评估（7分量表）验证工具有效性。

Result: DMRS Co-Pilot使标注时间缩短22.4%，专家评分显示证据支持（4.62）、临床合理性（4.44）和洞察力（4.40）良好。最佳模型宏F1得分为30%，但存在成熟防御机制过度预测现象。语料库分析确认成熟防御为主导，但特定情绪（如愤怒）呈现非常规模式。

Conclusion: 本文为心理防御机制的语言学分析提供了标准化资源和工具框架，但当前算法仍需改进以解决预测偏差问题。开放的语料库、代码和提示词将推动防御功能研究，未来可探索多模态情感计算和临床干预优化。

Abstract: Psychological defenses are strategies, often automatic, that people use to manage distress. Rigid or overuse of defenses is negatively linked to mental health and shapes what speakers disclose and how they accept or resist help. However, defenses are complex and difficult to reliably measure, particularly in clinical dialogues. We introduce PsyDefConv, a dialogue corpus with help seeker utterances labeled for defense level, and DMRS Co-Pilot, a four-stage pipeline that provides evidence-based pre-annotations. The corpus contains 200 dialogues and 4709 utterances, including 2336 help seeker turns, with labeling and Cohen's kappa 0.639. In a counterbalanced study, the co-pilot reduced average annotation time by 22.4%. In expert review, it averaged 4.62 for evidence, 4.44 for clinical plausibility, and 4.40 for insight on a seven-point scale. Benchmarks with strong language models in zero-shot and fine-tuning settings demonstrate clear headroom, with the best macro F1-score around 30% and a tendency to overpredict mature defenses. Corpus analyses confirm that mature defenses are most common and reveal emotion-specific deviations. We will release the corpus, annotations, code, and prompts to support research on defensive functioning in language.

Abstract: LLMs (Large Language Models) are increasingly used in text processing pipelines to intelligently respond to a variety of inputs and generation tasks. This raises the possibility of replacing human roles that bottleneck existing information flows, either due to insufficient staff or process complexity. However, LLMs make mistakes and some processing roles are safety critical. For example, triaging post-operative care to patients based on hospital referral letters, or updating site access schedules in nuclear facilities for work crews. If we want to introduce LLMs into critical information flows that were previously performed by humans, how can we make them safe and reliable? Rather than make performative claims about augmented generation frameworks or graph-based techniques, this paper argues that the safety argument should focus on the type of evidence we get from evaluation points in LLM processes, particularly in frameworks that employ LLM-as-Judges (LaJ) evaluators. This paper argues that although we cannot get deterministic evaluations from many natural language processing tasks, by adopting a basket of weighted metrics it may be possible to lower the risk of errors within an evaluation, use context sensitivity to define error severity and design confidence thresholds that trigger human review of critical LaJ judgments when concordance across evaluators is low.

TL;DR: The paper compares full fine-tuning (SFT) and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA, showing that LoRA can match or outperform SFT in reasoning tasks when optimal rank configurations are used, with insights into attention structures and generalization behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PEFT methods (e.g., LoRA) are widely adopted for efficiency, but their hyperparameter impacts (e.g., rank selection) in downstream NLP tasks and generalization remain under-researched. The study aims to quantify the trade-offs between SFT and PEFT across diverse learning scenarios.

Method: A systematic rank sweep evaluation of SFT vs. LoRA is conducted across reasoning and recall datasets, including in-domain/out-of-domain adaptation. Methods also include analyzing spectral features of internal representations and layer-wise attention patterns to reveal structural changes during adaptation.

Result: LoRA achieves competitive/superior accuracy compared to SFT on reasoning tasks at specific ranks. Key findings include distinct generalization patterns, task-specific forgetting phenomena, and representational drift in attention mechanisms across layers, with rank values significantly affecting model behavior.

Conclusion: Properly configured PEFT (LoRA) can outperform SFT in certain tasks while maintaining efficiency. The study provides empirical guidance for rank selection and reveals critical insights into how PEFT alters model representations and attention dynamics during adaptation, particularly in challenging reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly adapted to downstream tasks through fine-tuning. Full supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), are two dominant approaches. While PEFT methods are widely used for their computational efficiency, the implications of their configurations (e.g., rank) remain under-explored in downstream Q&A tasks and generalisation. In this work, we perform a comprehensive evaluation across multiple reasoning and recall datasets, conducting a rank sweep to quantify the trade-off between SFT and PEFT. We also compare the accuracy of PEFT and SFT models across in-domain and out-of-domain adaptation, highlighting distinct generalisation behaviour and task-specific forgetting. We demonstrate that LoRA achieves competitive and in some cases superior performance compared to SFT, particularly on reasoning tasks at specific rank values. Additionally, we analyze the internal representations via spectral features and layer-wise attention structures, offering insights into representational drift and structural changes in attention patterns.

Conclusion: PPSEBM为解决灾难性遗忘提供了新颖且稳健的解决方案，其参数动态分配与样本生成机制为持续学习领域研究开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Continual learning remains a fundamental challenge in machine learning, requiring models to learn from a stream of tasks without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. A major obstacle in this setting is catastrophic forgetting, where performance on earlier tasks degrades as new tasks are learned. In this paper, we introduce PPSEBM, a novel framework that integrates an Energy-Based Model (EBM) with Progressive Parameter Selection (PPS) to effectively address catastrophic forgetting in continual learning for natural language processing tasks. In PPSEBM, progressive parameter selection allocates distinct, task-specific parameters for each new task, while the EBM generates representative pseudo-samples from prior tasks. These generated samples actively inform and guide the parameter selection process, enhancing the model's ability to retain past knowledge while adapting to new tasks. Experimental results on diverse NLP benchmarks demonstrate that PPSEBM outperforms state-of-the-art continual learning methods, offering a promising and robust solution to mitigate catastrophic forgetting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM激活解释方法复杂且适用范围受限，而LatentQA提供直观的语言问答方式。本文研究如何通过多样化训练提升其泛化性，验证其在复杂任务（如逆向工程模型微调知识）中的有效性。

Method: 训练Activation Oracles（AOs）在多样化数据集上（包括分类任务和自监督任务），以LLM激活为输入并用自然语言回答问题。在四个下游任务中与既有白盒/黑盒方法对比性能，分析训练数据多样性对效果的影响。

Result: AOs可恢复模型微调后的知识（即使未接触过微调模型激活），且多样化训练显著提升泛化能力。在四个任务中，最佳AOs与白盒方法相当或更优，3个任务表现最佳。

Conclusion: 多样化训练使LatentQA模型具备从激活状态中提取通用信息的能力，证明其作为LLM解释工具的有效性和优越性。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) activations are notoriously difficult to understand, with most existing techniques using complex, specialized methods for interpreting them. Recent work has proposed a simpler approach known as LatentQA: training LLMs to directly accept LLM activations as inputs and answer arbitrary questions about them in natural language. However, prior work has focused on narrow task settings for both training and evaluation. In this paper, we instead take a generalist perspective. We evaluate LatentQA-trained models, which we call Activation Oracles (AOs), in far out-of-distribution settings and examine how performance scales with training data diversity. We find that AOs can recover information fine-tuned into a model (e.g., biographical knowledge or malign propensities) that does not appear in the input text, despite never being trained with activations from a fine-tuned model. Our main evaluations are four downstream tasks where we can compare to prior white- and black-box techniques. We find that even narrowly-trained LatentQA models can generalize well, and that adding additional training datasets (such as classification tasks and a self-supervised context prediction task) yields consistent further improvements. Overall, our best AOs match or exceed prior white-box baselines on all four tasks and are the best method on 3 out of 4. These results suggest that diversified training to answer natural-language queries imparts a general capability to verbalize information about LLM activations.
