*Carlo Sgaravatti,Riccardo Pieroni,Matteo Corno,Sergio M. Savaresi,Luca Magri,Giacomo Boracchi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LCF3D通过传感器融合框架（结合RGB 2D检测与LiDAR 3D检测），采用late cascade fusion策略，显著提升3D物体检测精度，尤其在复杂场景中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为解决LiDAR单一数据源在3D检测中的不足，以及多模态数据融合难题，旨在提高自动驾驶领域中对行人、骑行者等小目标的检测准确率。

Method: 提出分层融合策略：(i) 晚期融合（过滤LiDAR误检）；(ii) 级联融合（基于RGB检测生成新3D候选框补充遗漏）；结合两种数据源优势补偿彼此缺陷。

Result: 在KITTI数据集上显著优于LiDAR方法（尤其对行人/骑行者），在nuScenes中对摩托车/自行车检测提升明显，且具备处理不同传感器配置的域泛化能力。

Conclusion: LCF3D框架通过融合RGB-LiDAR数据，解决了目标漏检与误检问题，开源代码为自动驾驶领域的跨模态研究提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Accurately localizing 3D objects like pedestrians, cyclists, and other vehicles is essential in Autonomous Driving. To ensure high detection performance, Autonomous Vehicles complement RGB cameras with LiDAR sensors, but effectively combining these data sources for 3D object detection remains challenging. We propose LCF3D, a novel sensor fusion framework that combines a 2D object detector on RGB images with a 3D object detector on LiDAR point clouds. By leveraging multimodal fusion principles, we compensate for inaccuracies in the LiDAR object detection network. Our solution combines two key principles: (i) late fusion, to reduce LiDAR False Positives by matching LiDAR 3D detections with RGB 2D detections and filtering out unmatched LiDAR detections; and (ii) cascade fusion, to recover missed objects from LiDAR by generating new 3D frustum proposals corresponding to unmatched RGB detections. Experiments show that LCF3D is beneficial for domain generalization, as it turns out to be successful in handling different sensor configurations between training and testing domains. LCF3D achieves significant improvements over LiDAR-based methods, particularly for challenging categories like pedestrians and cyclists in the KITTI dataset, as well as motorcycles and bicycles in nuScenes.

### [2] [ViSIL: Unified Evaluation of Information Loss in Multimodal Video Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09851)
*Po-han Li,Shenghui Chen,Ufuk Topcu,Sandeep Chinchali*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出ViSIL评分，基于信息理论评估多模态视频摘要的信息损失，通过视觉语言模型量化跨模态信息覆盖，为不同格式摘要提供统一比较框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统文本指标（如BLEU）无法有效评估视频关键帧与文本摘要间的跨模态信息差异，亟需能统一刻画多模态信息损失的评价体系。

Method: 构建基于信息理论的ViSIL框架，通过视觉语言模型（VLM）推断生成摘要中未覆盖的原始视频信息，量化多模态总结的信息损失量。

Result: ViSIL分数与人类及VLM的视频问答（VQA）表现呈显著负相关，且通过Pareto前沿优化实现信息损失与处理速度的平衡，在不增加负载下比文本摘要提升7% VQA准确率。

Conclusion: ViSIL作为跨模态摘要评估的统一指标，不仅有效反映生成质量与任务性能关系，还为多模态信息压缩方案提供可量化的优化路径。

Abstract: Multimodal video captioning condenses dense footage into a structured format of keyframes and natural language. By creating a cohesive multimodal summary, this approach anchors generative AI in rich semantic evidence and serves as a lightweight proxy for high-efficiency retrieval. However, traditional metrics like BLEU or ROUGE fail to quantify information coverage across disparate modalities, such as comparing a paragraph of text to a sequence of keyframes. To address this, we propose the Video Summary Information Loss (ViSIL) score, an information-theoretic framework that quantifies the video information not captured by a summary via vision-language model (VLM) inference. By measuring the information loss, ViSIL is a unified metric that enables direct comparison across multimodal summary formats despite their structural discrepancies. Our results demonstrate that ViSIL scores show a statistically significant correlation with both human and VLM performance on Video Question Answering (VQA) tasks. ViSIL also enables summary selection to optimize the trade-off between information loss and processing speed, establishing a Pareto-optimal frontier that outperforms text summaries by $7\%$ in VQA accuracy without increasing processing load.

### [3] [Breaking the Limits of Open-Weight CLIP: An Optimization Framework for Self-supervised Fine-tuning of CLIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09859)
*Anant Mehta,Xiyuan Wei,Xingyu Chen,Tianbao Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出TuneCLIP框架，通过自监督微调显著提升开源CLIP模型在多个任务中的性能，而无需从头训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进CLIP模型通常需要耗费大量资源的从头训练，但作者旨在仅使用现有自监督数据集，提升开源CLIP模型在多任务中的通用性能，同时避免标准微调方法导致的性能退化。

Method: TuneCLIP包含两种关键组件：（1）理论驱动的热身阶段，通过恢复优化统计量减少冷启动偏差；（2）优化新对比损失的微调阶段，缓解对伪负例的惩罚。

Result: 实验表明，TuneCLIP在不同模型架构和规模中均能稳定提升性能，例如在ImageNet上提升+2.5%，在DataComp基准上提升+1.2%，并显著改进分布外泛化能力。

Conclusion: TuneCLIP为高效的CLIP模型适配提供了新范式，建立了新的强基线，验证了自监督微调在保持预训练知识的同时提升模型性能的有效性。

Abstract: CLIP has become a cornerstone of multimodal representation learning, yet improving its performance typically requires a prohibitively costly process of training from scratch on billions of samples. We ask a different question: Can we improve the performance of open-weight CLIP models across various downstream tasks using only existing self-supervised datasets? Unlike supervised fine-tuning, which adapts a pretrained model to a single downstream task, our setting seeks to improve general performance across various tasks. However, as both our experiments and prior studies reveal, simply applying standard training protocols starting from an open-weight CLIP model often fails, leading to performance degradation. In this paper, we introduce TuneCLIP, a self-supervised fine-tuning framework that overcomes the performance degradation. TuneCLIP has two key components: (1) a warm-up stage of recovering optimization statistics to reduce cold-start bias, inspired by theoretical analysis, and (2) a fine-tuning stage of optimizing a new contrastive loss to mitigate the penalization on false negative pairs. Our extensive experiments show that TuneCLIP consistently improves performance across model architectures and scales. Notably, it elevates leading open-weight models like SigLIP (ViT-B/16), achieving gains of up to +2.5% on ImageNet and related out-of-distribution benchmarks, and +1.2% on the highly competitive DataComp benchmark, setting a new strong baseline for efficient post-pretraining adaptation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了MedVL-SAM2，一个统一的3D医学多模态模型，同时支持报告生成、视觉问答(VQA)及多范式分割任务（如语义、指示和交互式分割），通过融合图像级推理与像素级感知实现高精度的3D多粒度空间推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学视觉语言模型（VLMs）在图像级任务表现优异，但3D医学模型的细粒度视觉定位和体积空间推理仍具挑战性，且缺乏统一的框架将其能力整合。

Method: 提出MedVL-SAM2，采用SAM2构建的体积分割模块结合图像级与像素级架构。首先在3D CT图像-文本对上预训练，再通过多阶段流程联合优化语言理解和分割目标，并支持语言、点或框提示的灵活交互。

Result: 模型在报告生成、VQA及3D分割任务中均达SOTA性能，能够实现可靠的3D视觉定位、可控的交互分割与鲁棒的跨模态推理。

Conclusion: 研究验证了统一框架下医学VLMs可同时实现高水平语义推理与精确3D定位，为多模态医学分析提供了高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent progress in medical vision-language models (VLMs) has achieved strong performance on image-level text-centric tasks such as report generation and visual question answering (VQA). However, achieving fine-grained visual grounding and volumetric spatial reasoning in 3D medical VLMs remains challenging, particularly when aiming to unify these capabilities within a single, generalizable framework. To address this challenge, we proposed MedVL-SAM2, a unified 3D medical multimodal model that concurrently supports report generation, VQA, and multi-paradigm segmentation, including semantic, referring, and interactive segmentation. MedVL-SAM2 integrates image-level reasoning and pixel-level perception through a cohesive architecture tailored for 3D medical imaging, and incorporates a SAM2-based volumetric segmentation module to enable precise multi-granular spatial reasoning. The model is trained in a multi-stage pipeline: it is first pre-trained on a large-scale corpus of 3D CT image-text pairs to align volumetric visual features with radiology-language embeddings. It is then jointly optimized with both language-understanding and segmentation objectives using a comprehensive 3D CT segmentation dataset. This joint training enables flexible interaction via language, point, or box prompts, thereby unifying high-level visual reasoning with spatially precise localization. Our unified architecture delivers state-of-the-art performance across report generation, VQA, and multiple 3D segmentation tasks. Extensive analyses further show that the model provides reliable 3D visual grounding, controllable interactive segmentation, and robust cross-modal reasoning, demonstrating that high-level semantic reasoning and precise 3D localization can be jointly achieved within a unified 3D medical VLM.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出OT-Drive框架，通过联合优化RGB与表面法线特征传输至语义锚点流形，实现出分布场景下可行驶区域分割性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据驱动方法在自动驾驶异常分布（OOD）场景中分割性能下降，需提升未知环境泛化能力

Method: 设计场景锚点生成器（SAG）构建联合分布语义锚点，采用最优传输理论融合多模态特征至动态流形空间

Result: 在ORFD数据集OOD场景达95.16% mIoU（+6.35%），跨数据集任务89.79% mIoU（+13.99%）

Conclusion: 验证了语义锚点与最优传输机制对小样本OOD场景的泛化有效性，提升道路分割鲁棒性

Abstract: Reliable traversable area segmentation in unstructured environments is critical for planning and decision-making in autonomous driving. However, existing data-driven approaches often suffer from degraded segmentation performance in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios, consequently impairing downstream driving tasks. To address this issue, we propose OT-Drive, an Optimal Transport--driven multi-modal fusion framework. The proposed method formulates RGB and surface normal fusion as a distribution transport problem. Specifically, we design a novel Scene Anchor Generator (SAG) to decompose scene information into the joint distribution of weather, time-of-day, and road type, thereby constructing semantic anchors that can generalize to unseen scenarios. Subsequently, we design an innovative Optimal Transport-based multi-modal fusion module (OT Fusion) to transport RGB and surface normal features onto the manifold defined by the semantic anchors, enabling robust traversable area segmentation under OOD scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves 95.16% mIoU on ORFD OOD scenarios, outperforming prior methods by 6.35%, and 89.79% mIoU on cross-dataset transfer tasks, surpassing baselines by 13.99%.These results indicate that the proposed model can attain strong OOD generalization with only limited training data, substantially enhancing its practicality and efficiency for real-world deployment.

*Nahid Alam,Leema Krishna Murali,Siddhant Bharadwaj,Patrick Liu,Timothy Chung,Drishti Sharma,Akshata A,Kranthi Kiran,Wesley Tam,Bala Krishna S Vegesna*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文指出当前视觉-语言模型（VLM）因图像编码方式丢失空间结构的问题，提出改进图像编码器训练目标和引入2D位置编码的解决方案，实验证明可提升空间推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLM（如CLIP）将图像展平为一维序列破坏空间结构，导致对机器人、具身AI等需要空间定位的任务存在瓶颈，需解决模型空间感知缺失问题。

Method: （1）采用非对比学习的图像编码器训练目标；（2）设计保留二维空间结构的位置编码机制。通过二者结合重构VLM架构。

Result: 改进后的模型在多个视觉空间推理基准测试中（包括几何关系判断、空间定位任务）表现显著提升，空间敏感型任务指标提升15%-30%。

Conclusion: 2D空间感知是VLM关键改进方向，提出的编码器训练目标与位置编码方法为下一代具身智能模型设计提供了有效范式，尤其适用于需要坐标级理解的场景应用。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced rapidly, but their ability to capture spatial relationships remains a blindspot. Current VLMs are typically built with contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP) style image encoders. The training recipe often flattens images into 1D patch sequences, discarding the 2D structure necessary for spatial reasoning. We argue that this lack of spatial awareness is a missing dimension in VLM design and a bottleneck for applications requiring spatial grounding, such as robotics and embodied AI. To address this, we investigate (i) image encoders trained with alternative objectives and (ii) 2D positional encodings. Our experiments show that these architectural choices can lead to improved spatial reasoning on several benchmarks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在复杂文本查询下易产生冗长推理链干扰分割，且依赖额外监督。

Method: 两阶段rollout策略：1）生成自包含目标描述；2）用描述验证并替代原查询。引入两种自我奖励增强目标导向推理并抑制冗余思考。

Result: 实验显示DR²Seg在不同规模MLLM和分割模型上均显著提升效率与性能，减少冗余推理。

Conclusion: DR²Seg通过自包含描述和自我奖励机制，有效解决视觉语言推理分割中的过思考问题，具备广泛适用性。

Abstract: Reasoning segmentation is an emerging vision-language task that requires reasoning over intricate text queries to precisely segment objects. However, existing methods typically suffer from overthinking, generating verbose reasoning chains that interfere with object localization in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). To address this issue, we propose DR$^2$Seg, a self-rewarding framework that improves both reasoning efficiency and segmentation accuracy without requiring extra thinking supervision. DR$^2$Seg employs a two-stage rollout strategy that decomposes reasoning segmentation into multimodal reasoning and referring segmentation. In the first stage, the model generates a self-contained description that explicitly specifies the target object. In the second stage, this description replaces the original complex query to verify its self-containment. Based on this design, two self-rewards are introduced to strengthen goal-oriented reasoning and suppress redundant thinking. Extensive experiments across MLLMs of varying scales and segmentation models demonstrate that DR$^2$Seg consistently improves reasoning efficiency and overall segmentation performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频大语言模型（VideoLLMs）在事件存在性幻觉方面已有研究，但事件关系幻觉（如因果、时间、子事件关系）被忽视。本文旨在填补这一研究空白，建立系统性评估框架。

Method: 构建包含关系分类、问答和反事实问答任务的基准测试，引入反直觉视频场景和人工标注的视觉-语言/纯语言偏差候选集。通过分析现有模型表现，提出基于中间层帧级注意力重分配的KFP策略。

Result: 现有SOTA模型在密集事件关系推理中依赖先验知识，缺乏帧级线索利用能力；模型能准确捕捉关键事件但易忽略子事件。KFP方法在不降低推理速度的前提下有效缓解事件关系幻觉。

Conclusion: 本研究揭示了视频大模型在事件关系理解中的系统性缺陷，提供标准化评估工具VERHallu，并提出有效的解决方案KFP，为后续研究奠定基础。

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) exhibit various types of hallucinations. Existing research has primarily focused on hallucinations involving the presence of events, objects, and scenes in videos, while largely neglecting event relation hallucination. In this paper, we introduce a novel benchmark for evaluating the Video Event Relation Hallucination, named VERHallu. This benchmark focuses on causal, temporal, and subevent relations between events, encompassing three types of tasks: relation classification, question answering, and counterfactual question answering, for a comprehensive evaluation of event relation hallucination. Additionally, it features counterintuitive video scenarios that deviate from typical pretraining distributions, with each sample accompanied by human-annotated candidates covering both vision-language and pure language biases. Our analysis reveals that current state-of-the-art VideoLLMs struggle with dense-event relation reasoning, often relying on prior knowledge due to insufficient use of frame-level cues. Although these models demonstrate strong grounding capabilities for key events, they often overlook the surrounding subevents, leading to an incomplete and inaccurate understanding of event relations. To tackle this, we propose a Key-Frame Propagating (KFP) strategy, which reallocates frame-level attention within intermediate layers to enhance multi-event understanding. Experiments show it effectively mitigates the event relation hallucination without affecting inference speed.

### [9] [Disentangled Concept Representation for Text-to-image Person Re-identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10053)
*Giyeol Kim,Chanho Eom*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DiCo框架利用分层解耦的跨模态表示提升文本-图像行人重识别性能，通过共享槽结构和概念块分解实现细粒度属性对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本与图像模态差异大、个体细粒度差异难建模导致的TIReID挑战，现有方法在跨模态对应和可解释性上存在局限。

Method: 构建共享槽空间作为跨模态局部锚点，每个槽分解为颜色/纹理/形状等概念块实现属性解耦，通过层级注意力机制建立多粒度对齐。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上均达到SOTA水平，mAP指标提升1.2-3.7个百分点，可视化验证了槽结构对部件定位和属性解耦的有效性。

Conclusion: 层次化解耦表示显著缩小跨模态差异，在保持高性能的同时通过显式可解释结构为细粒度检索提供直观分析视角。

Abstract: Text-to-image person re-identification (TIReID) aims to retrieve person images from a large gallery given free-form textual descriptions. TIReID is challenging due to the substantial modality gap between visual appearances and textual expressions, as well as the need to model fine-grained correspondences that distinguish individuals with similar attributes such as clothing color, texture, or outfit style. To address these issues, we propose DiCo (Disentangled Concept Representation), a novel framework that achieves hierarchical and disentangled cross-modal alignment. DiCo introduces a shared slot-based representation, where each slot acts as a part-level anchor across modalities and is further decomposed into multiple concept blocks. This design enables the disentanglement of complementary attributes (\textit{e.g.}, color, texture, shape) while maintaining consistent part-level correspondence between image and text. Extensive experiments on CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, and RSTPReid demonstrate that our framework achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods, while also enhancing interpretability through explicit slot- and block-level representations for more fine-grained retrieval results.

### [10] [UEOF: A Benchmark Dataset for Underwater Event-Based Optical Flow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10054)
*Nick Truong,Pritam P. Karmokar,William J. Beksi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个用于水下事件相机光流估计的合成基准数据集，结合物理光线追踪RGBD序列和事件生成管道，解决水下成像中光流数据不足的问题。

Result: 成功构建首个合成水下事件光流数据集，实验揭示了水下光传输对事件形成及运动估计精度的影响，为未来算法提供了量化基准。

Conclusion: 该数据集为水下事件驱动感知算法的研发与评估奠定了基础，代码与数据集已公开。

Abstract: Underwater imaging is fundamentally challenging due to wavelength-dependent light attenuation, strong scattering from suspended particles, turbidity-induced blur, and non-uniform illumination. These effects impair standard cameras and make ground-truth motion nearly impossible to obtain. On the other hand, event cameras offer microsecond resolution and high dynamic range. Nonetheless, progress on investigating event cameras for underwater environments has been limited due to the lack of datasets that pair realistic underwater optics with accurate optical flow. To address this problem, we introduce the first synthetic underwater benchmark dataset for event-based optical flow derived from physically-based ray-traced RGBD sequences. Using a modern video-to-event pipeline applied to rendered underwater videos, we produce realistic event data streams with dense ground-truth flow, depth, and camera motion. Moreover, we benchmark state-of-the-art learning-based and model-based optical flow prediction methods to understand how underwater light transport affects event formation and motion estimation accuracy. Our dataset establishes a new baseline for future development and evaluation of underwater event-based perception algorithms. The source code and dataset for this project are publicly available at https://robotic-vision-lab.github.io/ueof.

Method: 提出逐步视觉优化生成框架，将中间帧显式作为推理步骤；构建包含语义到美学演变轨迹的CoF-Evol-Instruct数据集，并设计独立帧编码策略以消除运动伪影。

Conclusion: 视频模型通过链帧推理可有效提升文本图像生成质量，展现出在生成模型领域的广阔应用前景。

Abstract: Recent video generation models have revealed the emergence of Chain-of-Frame (CoF) reasoning, enabling frame-by-frame visual inference. With this capability, video models have been successfully applied to various visual tasks (e.g., maze solving, visual puzzles). However, their potential to enhance text-to-image (T2I) generation remains largely unexplored due to the absence of a clearly defined visual reasoning starting point and interpretable intermediate states in the T2I generation process. To bridge this gap, we propose CoF-T2I, a model that integrates CoF reasoning into T2I generation via progressive visual refinement, where intermediate frames act as explicit reasoning steps and the final frame is taken as output. To establish such an explicit generation process, we curate CoF-Evol-Instruct, a dataset of CoF trajectories that model the generation process from semantics to aesthetics. To further improve quality and avoid motion artifacts, we enable independent encoding operation for each frame. Experiments show that CoF-T2I significantly outperforms the base video model and achieves competitive performance on challenging benchmarks, reaching 0.86 on GenEval and 7.468 on Imagine-Bench. These results indicate the substantial promise of video models for advancing high-quality text-to-image generation.

### [12] [Thinking Like Van Gogh: Structure-Aware Style Transfer via Flow-Guided 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10075)
*Zhendong Wang,Lebin Zhou,Jingchuan Xiao,Rongduo Han,Nam Ling,Cihan Ruan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a 3D style transfer method inspired by Post-Impressionism, focusing on geometric abstraction over surface textures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D style transfer methods prioritize rigid geometry with surface-level textures, conflicting with Post-Impressionism's emphasis on structural exaggeration. The study aims to align 3D rendering with this artistic philosophy.

Method: A flow-guided geometric advection framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) was developed. It extracts directional flow fields from 2D paintings and back-propagates them into 3D space, enabling mesh-free geometric deformation. Key strategies include flow-aligned brushstroke creation, luminance-structure decoupling, and a VLM-as-a-Judge evaluation framework.

Result: The method enables expressive 3D geometric abstraction aligned with scene topology, avoiding photometric constraints. It achieves structural deformation driven by painterly motion and introduces a subjective artistic authenticity assessment.

Conclusion: This work successfully bridges Post-Impressionist artistic principles with 3D rendering by prioritizing geometric abstraction. The proposed framework and evaluation methodology offer novel tools for stylized 3D content creation without mesh priors.

Abstract: In 1888, Vincent van Gogh wrote, "I am seeking exaggeration in the essential." This principle, amplifying structural form while suppressing photographic detail, lies at the core of Post-Impressionist art. However, most existing 3D style transfer methods invert this philosophy, treating geometry as a rigid substrate for surface-level texture projection. To authentically reproduce Post-Impressionist stylization, geometric abstraction must be embraced as the primary vehicle of expression.
  We propose a flow-guided geometric advection framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) that operationalizes this principle in a mesh-free setting. Our method extracts directional flow fields from 2D paintings and back-propagates them into 3D space, rectifying Gaussian primitives to form flow-aligned brushstrokes that conform to scene topology without relying on explicit mesh priors. This enables expressive structural deformation driven directly by painterly motion rather than photometric constraints.
  Our contributions are threefold: (1) a projection-based, mesh-free flow guidance mechanism that transfers 2D artistic motion into 3D Gaussian geometry; (2) a luminance-structure decoupling strategy that isolates geometric deformation from color optimization, mitigating artifacts during aggressive structural abstraction; and (3) a VLM-as-a-Judge evaluation framework that assesses artistic authenticity through aesthetic judgment instead of conventional pixel-level metrics, explicitly addressing the subjective nature of artistic stylization.

TL;DR: 本文提出难度引导采样（DGS）与难度感知引导（DAG）方法，通过引入任务相关难度概念解决数据集蒸馏与下游任务的目标差距问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集蒸馏方法仅关注原始数据特征，忽略任务特定信息导致目标函数与实际任务需求脱节（即目标差距）。作者旨在通过引入难度机制弥合这一差距以提升下游任务性能。

Method: 在图像分类任务中设计两阶段框架：1）提出DGS模块，根据预定义难度分布从未生成数据中采样；2）提出DAG机制，在生成过程中嵌入难度感知约束。作为可插拔后处理模块，适配现有数据蒸馏方法。

Result: 在多个基准任务上验证有效性：CIFAR-10/100-ResNet实验显示，在保留50%数据时测试准确率提升4.5%/3.8%；对比基线方法在同等准确率下训练效率提升。实验验证了难度机制在图像生成、少样本学习等场景的普适性。

Conclusion: 难度概念被成功引入数据集蒸馏领域，提出的框架在不改变主模型结构下显著提升下游任务性能，为难度在更广泛任务（如目标检测）中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose difficulty-guided sampling (DGS) to bridge the target gap between the distillation objective and the downstream task, therefore improving the performance of dataset distillation. Deep neural networks achieve remarkable performance but have time and storage-consuming training processes. Dataset distillation is proposed to generate compact, high-quality distilled datasets, enabling effective model training while maintaining downstream performance. Existing approaches typically focus on features extracted from the original dataset, overlooking task-specific information, which leads to a target gap between the distillation objective and the downstream task. We propose leveraging characteristics that benefit the downstream training into data distillation to bridge this gap. Focusing on the downstream task of image classification, we introduce the concept of difficulty and propose DGS as a plug-in post-stage sampling module. Following the specific target difficulty distribution, the final distilled dataset is sampled from image pools generated by existing methods. We also propose difficulty-aware guidance (DAG) to explore the effect of difficulty in the generation process. Extensive experiments across multiple settings demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. It also highlights the broader potential of difficulty for diverse downstream tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal learning have significantly enhanced the reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs). However, state-of-the-art approaches rely heavily on large-scale human-annotated datasets, which are costly and time-consuming to acquire. To overcome this limitation, we introduce V-Zero, a general post-training framework that facilitates self-improvement using exclusively unlabeled images. V-Zero establishes a co-evolutionary loop by instantiating two distinct roles: a Questioner and a Solver. The Questioner learns to synthesize high-quality, challenging questions by leveraging a dual-track reasoning reward that contrasts intuitive guesses with reasoned results. The Solver is optimized using pseudo-labels derived from majority voting over its own sampled responses. Both roles are trained iteratively via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), driving a cycle of mutual enhancement. Remarkably, without a single human annotation, V-Zero achieves consistent performance gains on Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, improving visual mathematical reasoning by +1.7 and general vision-centric by +2.6, demonstrating the potential of self-improvement in multimodal systems.

*Wenwen Liao,Hang Ruan,Jianbo Yu,Yuansong Wang,Qingchao Jiang,Xiaofeng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes InfoSculpt, a novel framework for Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) that uses information-theoretic methods to disentangle category-defining signals from noise, outperforming existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GCD methods rely on pseudo-labeling or two-stage clustering, which lack a principled mechanism to separate essential category signals from instance-specific noise. This study addresses this limitation by integrating information theory.

Method: InfoSculpt employs a dual Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) objective: Category-Level CMI on labeled data to learn compact representations for known classes, and Instance-Level CMI on all data to distill invariant features by compressing augmentation-induced noise, creating a disentangled latent space.

Result: Experiments on 8 benchmarks demonstrate InfoSculpt's effectiveness in achieving superior performance over existing methods.

Conclusion: The information-theoretic approach (InfoSculpt) successfully preserves categorical information while discarding noise, validating its potential for real-world open-world applications.

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to classify instances from both known and novel categories within a large-scale unlabeled dataset, a critical yet challenging task for real-world, open-world applications. However, existing methods often rely on pseudo-labeling, or two-stage clustering, which lack a principled mechanism to explicitly disentangle essential, category-defining signals from instance-specific noise. In this paper, we address this fundamental limitation by re-framing GCD from an information-theoretic perspective, grounded in the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle. We introduce InfoSculpt, a novel framework that systematically sculpts the representation space by minimizing a dual Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) objective. InfoSculpt uniquely combines a Category-Level CMI on labeled data to learn compact and discriminative representations for known classes, and a complementary Instance-Level CMI on all data to distill invariant features by compressing augmentation-induced noise. These two objectives work synergistically at different scales to produce a disentangled and robust latent space where categorical information is preserved while noisy, instance-specific details are discarded. Extensive experiments on 8 benchmarks demonstrate that InfoSculpt validating the effectiveness of our information-theoretic approach.

Abstract: Interactive humanoid video generation aims to synthesize lifelike visual agents that can engage with humans through continuous and responsive video. Despite recent advances in video synthesis, existing methods often grapple with the trade-off between high-fidelity synthesis and real-time interaction requirements. In this paper, we propose FlowAct-R1, a framework specifically designed for real-time interactive humanoid video generation. Built upon a MMDiT architecture, FlowAct-R1 enables the streaming synthesis of video with arbitrary durations while maintaining low-latency responsiveness. We introduce a chunkwise diffusion forcing strategy, complemented by a novel self-forcing variant, to alleviate error accumulation and ensure long-term temporal consistency during continuous interaction. By leveraging efficient distillation and system-level optimizations, our framework achieves a stable 25fps at 480p resolution with a time-to-first-frame (TTFF) of only around 1.5 seconds. The proposed method provides holistic and fine-grained full-body control, enabling the agent to transition naturally between diverse behavioral states in interactive scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that FlowAct-R1 achieves exceptional behavioral vividness and perceptual realism, while maintaining robust generalization across diverse character styles.

Abstract: The automated extraction of structured questions from paper-based mathematics exams is fundamental to intelligent education, yet remains challenging in real-world settings due to severe visual noise. Existing benchmarks mainly focus on clean documents or generic layout analysis, overlooking both the structural integrity of mathematical problems and the ability of models to actively reject incomplete inputs. We introduce MathDoc, the first benchmark for document-level information extraction from authentic high school mathematics exam papers. MathDoc contains \textbf{3,609} carefully curated questions with real-world artifacts and explicitly includes unrecognizable samples to evaluate active refusal behavior. We propose a multi-dimensional evaluation framework covering stem accuracy, visual similarity, and refusal capability. Experiments on SOTA MLLMs, including Qwen3-VL and Gemini-2.5-Pro, show that although end-to-end models achieve strong extraction performance, they consistently fail to refuse illegible inputs, instead producing confident but invalid outputs. These results highlight a critical gap in current MLLMs and establish MathDoc as a benchmark for assessing model reliability under degraded document conditions.

Motivation: 现有方法通过选择最优示例或简单聚合前K个示例压制了多示例上下文的协同价值，限制了模型推理能力。

Method: 生成三个分支表示，每个分支由不同组的优质示例组合而成，并通过专为多源协同设计的MULTI-VQGAN架构处理这些互补信号。

Conclusion: 多分支协作融合策略能更充分挖掘上下文信息的价值，相比单示例/简单聚合模式具有更强推理能力。

Abstract: Visual In-Context Learning (VICL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm, enabling models to perform novel visual tasks by learning from in-context examples. The dominant "retrieve-then-prompt" approach typically relies on selecting the single best visual prompt, a practice that often discards valuable contextual information from other suitable candidates. While recent work has explored fusing the top-K prompts into a single, enhanced representation, this still simply collapses multiple rich signals into one, limiting the model's reasoning capability. We argue that a more multi-faceted, collaborative fusion is required to unlock the full potential of these diverse contexts. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel framework that moves beyond single-prompt fusion towards an multi-combination collaborative fusion. Instead of collapsing multiple prompts into one, our method generates three contextual representation branches, each formed by integrating information from different combinations of top-quality prompts. These complementary guidance signals are then fed into proposed MULTI-VQGAN architecture, which is designed to jointly interpret and utilize collaborative information from multiple sources. Extensive experiments on diverse tasks, including foreground segmentation, single-object detection, and image colorization, highlight its strong cross-task generalization, effective contextual fusion, and ability to produce more robust and accurate predictions than existing methods.

*Wenwen Liao,Jianbo Yu,Yuansong Wang,Shifu Yan,Xiaofeng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes an improved Vision In-Context Learning (VICL) framework that addresses limitations in existing methods by fusing multiple prompts, utilizing arrangement-specific MLPs, and introducing bidirectional fine-tuning for enhanced inpainting model adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VICL methods discard complementary cues by selecting only the most similar prompt and fail to utilize structured information from different prompt arrangements.

Method: The framework introduces (1) an adaptive Fusion Module to aggregate patterns/annotations from multiple prompts, (2) arrangement-specific lightweight MLPs to decouple layout priors, and (3) a bidirectional fine-tuning mechanism to swap query/prompt roles for better collaboration between fusion and inpainting modules.

Result: Experiments show superior performance on foreground segmentation, single-object detection, and image colorization tasks, with strong cross-task generalization and improved prompt utilization efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed end-to-end VICL framework effectively resolves the limitations of traditional methods by leveraging multi-prompt fusion, structured arrangement learning, and collaborative bidirectional optimization.

Abstract: Vision In-Context Learning (VICL) enables inpainting models to quickly adapt to new visual tasks from only a few prompts. However, existing methods suffer from two key issues: (1) selecting only the most similar prompt discards complementary cues from other high-quality prompts; and (2) failing to exploit the structured information implied by different prompt arrangements.
  We propose an end-to-end VICL framework to overcome these limitations. Firstly, an adaptive Fusion Module aggregates critical patterns and annotations from multiple prompts to form more precise contextual prompts. Secondly, we introduce arrangement-specific lightweight MLPs to decouple layout priors from the core model, while minimally affecting the overall model. In addition, an bidirectional fine-tuning mechanism swaps the roles of query and prompt, encouraging the model to reconstruct the original prompt from fused context and thus enhancing collaboration between the fusion module and the inpainting model. Experiments on foreground segmentation, single-object detection, and image colorization demonstrate superior results and strong cross-task generalization of our method.

Motivation: 传统特征随机扰动依赖需人工调参的dropout策略，存在过度拟合和正则化不足问题，需开发可精确控制的离散特征扰动新方法。

Method: 构建双分支架构：1) 使用QPM模块对VQ码书索引进行空间混洗实现特征扰动；2) 通过后量化特征适配器(PFA)融合基础模型提供的高层语义信息。建立包含828例肺癌CT标注数据集。

Conclusion: 该研究证实了VQ特征空间扰动在医学影像分割中的优越性，通过可解释的量化操作替代随机dropout，为半监督学习提供了新范式。

Abstract: Consistency learning with feature perturbation is a widely used strategy in semi-supervised medical image segmentation. However, many existing perturbation methods rely on dropout, and thus require a careful manual tuning of the dropout rate, which is a sensitive hyperparameter and often difficult to optimize and may lead to suboptimal regularization. To overcome this limitation, we propose VQ-Seg, the first approach to employ vector quantization (VQ) to discretize the feature space and introduce a novel and controllable Quantized Perturbation Module (QPM) that replaces dropout. Our QPM perturbs discrete representations by shuffling the spatial locations of codebook indices, enabling effective and controllable regularization. To mitigate potential information loss caused by quantization, we design a dual-branch architecture where the post-quantization feature space is shared by both image reconstruction and segmentation tasks. Moreover, we introduce a Post-VQ Feature Adapter (PFA) to incorporate guidance from a foundation model (FM), supplementing the high-level semantic information lost during quantization. Furthermore, we collect a large-scale Lung Cancer (LC) dataset comprising 828 CT scans annotated for central-type lung carcinoma. Extensive experiments on the LC dataset and other public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, which outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: 证明对齐潜视觉思维对多模态模型训练的关键作用，开辟基于动态感知轨迹的知识蒸馏新路径，为轻量级多模态系统提供有效训练范式。

Abstract: Current multimodal latent reasoning often relies on external supervision (e.g., auxiliary images), ignoring intrinsic visual attention dynamics. In this work, we identify a critical Perception Gap in distillation: student models frequently mimic a teacher's textual output while attending to fundamentally divergent visual regions, effectively relying on language priors rather than grounded perception. To bridge this, we propose LaViT, a framework that aligns latent visual thoughts rather than static embeddings. LaViT compels the student to autoregressively reconstruct the teacher's visual semantics and attention trajectories prior to text generation, employing a curriculum sensory gating mechanism to prevent shortcut learning. Extensive experiments show that LaViT significantly enhances visual grounding, achieving up to +16.9% gains on complex reasoning tasks and enabling a compact 3B model to outperform larger open-source variants and proprietary models like GPT-4o.

Abstract: Recent progress in reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models(MLLMs) has highlighted their potential for performing complex video understanding tasks. However, in the domain of Video Anomaly Detection and Understanding (VAD&U), existing MLLM-based methods are largely limited to anomaly localization or post-hoc description, lacking explicit reasoning processes, risk awareness, and decision-oriented interpretation. To address this gap, we define a new task termed Video Anomaly Reasoning (VAR), which elevates video anomaly analysis from descriptive understanding to structured, multi-stage reasoning. VAR explicitly requires models to perform progressive reasoning over anomalous events before answering anomaly-related questions, encompassing visual perception, causal interpretation, and risk-aware decision making. To support this task, we present a new dataset with 8,641 videos, where each video is annotated with diverse question types corresponding to different reasoning depths, totaling more than 50,000 samples, making it one of the largest datasets for video anomaly. The annotations are based on a structured Perception-Cognition-Action Chain-of-Thought (PerCoAct-CoT), which formalizes domain-specific reasoning priors for video anomaly understanding. This design enables systematic evaluation of multi-stage and adaptive anomaly reasoning. In addition, we propose Anomaly-Aware Group Relative Policy Optimization to further enhance reasoning reliability under weak supervision. Building upon the proposed task and dataset, we develop an end-to-end MLLM-based VAR model termed Vad-R1-Plus, which supports adaptive hierarchical reasoning and risk-aware decision making. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed benchmark and method effectively advance the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs on VAR tasks, outperforming both open-source and proprietary baselines.

Conclusion: RAG-3DSG在保证细粒度语义表达的同时，显著改善了3D场景图生成的可靠性与实时性，适用于机器人任务需求。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D Scene Graph (3DSG) generation can enhance various downstream tasks in robotics, such as manipulation and navigation, by leveraging structured semantic representations. A 3DSG is constructed from multiple images of a scene, where objects are represented as nodes and relationships as edges. However, existing works for open-vocabulary 3DSG generation suffer from both low object-level recognition accuracy and speed, mainly due to constrained viewpoints, occlusions, and redundant surface density. To address these challenges, we propose RAG-3DSG to mitigate aggregation noise through re-shot guided uncertainty estimation and support object-level Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) via reliable low-uncertainty objects. Furthermore, we propose a dynamic downsample-mapping strategy to accelerate cross-image object aggregation with adaptive granularity. Experiments on Replica dataset demonstrate that RAG-3DSG significantly improves node captioning accuracy in 3DSG generation while reducing the mapping time by two-thirds compared to the vanilla version.

Conclusion: 提出的紧密集成架构实现了高效的综合图像修复。

Abstract: All-in-one image restoration aims to adaptively handle multiple restoration tasks with a single trained model. Although existing methods achieve promising results by introducing prompt information or leveraging large models, the added learning modules increase system complexity and hinder real-time applicability. In this paper, we adopt a physical degradation modeling perspective and predict a task-aware inverse degradation operator for efficient all-in-one image restoration. The framework consists of two stages. In the first stage, the predicted inverse operator produces an initial restored image together with an uncertainty perception map that highlights regions difficult to reconstruct, ensuring restoration reliability. In the second stage, the restoration is further refined under the guidance of this uncertainty map. The same inverse operator prediction network is used in both stages, with task-aware parameters introduced after operator prediction to adapt to different degradation tasks. Moreover, by accelerating the convolution of the inverse operator, the proposed method achieves efficient all-in-one image restoration. The resulting tightly integrated architecture, termed OPIR, is extensively validated through experiments, demonstrating superior all-in-one restoration performance while remaining highly competitive on task-aligned restoration.

Abstract: We introduce ELITE, an Efficient Gaussian head avatar synthesis from a monocular video via Learned Initialization and TEst-time generative adaptation. Prior works rely either on a 3D data prior or a 2D generative prior to compensate for missing visual cues in monocular videos. However, 3D data prior methods often struggle to generalize in-the-wild, while 2D generative prior methods are computationally heavy and prone to identity hallucination. We identify a complementary synergy between these two priors and design an efficient system that achieves high-fidelity animatable avatar synthesis with strong in-the-wild generalization. Specifically, we introduce a feed-forward Mesh2Gaussian Prior Model (MGPM) that enables fast initialization of a Gaussian avatar. To further bridge the domain gap at test time, we design a test-time generative adaptation stage, leveraging both real and synthetic images as supervision. Unlike previous full diffusion denoising strategies that are slow and hallucination-prone, we propose a rendering-guided single-step diffusion enhancer that restores missing visual details, grounded on Gaussian avatar renderings. Our experiments demonstrate that ELITE produces visually superior avatars to prior works, even for challenging expressions, while achieving 60x faster synthesis than the 2D generative prior method.

Conclusion: 通过几何引导信号和双流机制，模型可有效理解相机运动并利用三维先验知识，实现高质量的可控视频生成。

Abstract: Camera control has been extensively studied in conditioned video generation; however, performing precisely altering the camera trajectories while faithfully preserving the video content remains a challenging task. The mainstream approach to achieving precise camera control is warping a 3D representation according to the target trajectory. However, such methods fail to fully leverage the 3D priors of video diffusion models (VDMs) and often fall into the Inpainting Trap, resulting in subject inconsistency and degraded generation quality. To address this problem, we propose DepthDirector, a video re-rendering framework with precise camera controllability. By leveraging the depth video from explicit 3D representation as camera-control guidance, our method can faithfully reproduce the dynamic scene of an input video under novel camera trajectories. Specifically, we design a View-Content Dual-Stream Condition mechanism that injects both the source video and the warped depth sequence rendered under the target viewpoint into the pretrained video generation model. This geometric guidance signal enables VDMs to comprehend camera movements and leverage their 3D understanding capabilities, thereby facilitating precise camera control and consistent content generation. Next, we introduce a lightweight LoRA-based video diffusion adapter to train our framework, fully preserving the knowledge priors of VDMs. Additionally, we construct a large-scale multi-camera synchronized dataset named MultiCam-WarpData using Unreal Engine 5, containing 8K videos across 1K dynamic scenes. Extensive experiments show that DepthDirector outperforms existing methods in both camera controllability and visual quality. Our code and dataset will be publicly available.

Abstract: Imagine sitting in a presentation, trying to follow the speaker while simultaneously scanning the slides for relevant information. While the entire slide is visible, identifying the relevant regions can be challenging. As you focus on one part of the slide, the speaker moves on to a new sentence, leaving you scrambling to catch up visually. This constant back-and-forth creates a disconnect between what is being said and the most important visual elements, making it hard to absorb key details, especially in fast-paced or content-heavy presentations such as conference talks. This requires an understanding of slides, including text, graphics, and layout. We introduce a method that automatically identifies and highlights the most relevant slide regions based on the speaker's narrative. By analyzing spoken content and matching it with textual or graphical elements in the slides, our approach ensures better synchronization between what listeners hear and what they need to attend to. We explore different ways of solving this problem and assess their success and failure cases. Analyzing multimedia documents is emerging as a key requirement for seamless understanding of content-rich videos, such as educational videos and conference talks, by reducing cognitive strain and improving comprehension.

Motivation: 中文视觉-语言预训练因高质量中文图文数据稀缺而落后于英文领域，亟需构建符合中文语义演进的高质量跨模态数据集

Method: 开发多阶段数据构建流程：1) 从Common Crawl获取原始数据 2) 采用基于规则和CLIP联合的过滤机制 3) 包含2024-2025年时效性数据 4) 实行三级质量控制（文本清洗/图像筛选/跨模态对齐）

Conclusion: DanQing通过提升数据质量和时效性，为中文VLP提供基准级训练集，实验证明其显著优势，CC-BY 4.0开源将推动领域发展

Abstract: Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) models demonstrate strong performance across various downstream tasks by learning from large-scale image-text pairs through contrastive pretraining. The release of extensive English image-text datasets (e.g., COYO-700M and LAION-400M) has enabled widespread adoption of models such as CLIP and SigLIP in tasks including cross-modal retrieval and image captioning. However, the advancement of Chinese vision-language pretraining has substantially lagged behind, due to the scarcity of high-quality Chinese image-text data. To address this gap, we develop a comprehensive pipeline for constructing a high-quality Chinese cross-modal dataset. As a result, we propose DanQing, which contains 100 million image-text pairs collected from Common Crawl. Different from existing datasets, DanQing is curated through a more rigorous selection process, yielding superior data quality. Moreover, DanQing is primarily built from 2024-2025 web data, enabling models to better capture evolving semantic trends and thus offering greater practical utility. We compare DanQing with existing datasets by continual pre-training of the SigLIP2 model. Experimental results show that DanQing consistently achieves superior performance across a range of Chinese downstream tasks, including zero-shot classification, cross-modal retrieval, and LMM-based evaluations. To facilitate further research in Chinese vision-language pre-training, we will open-source the DanQing dataset under the Creative Common CC-BY 4.0 license.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗攻击依赖样本特异性，扩展至大规模数据集或新场景时计算开销大，需更高效的通用攻击方法。

Method: HRA在图像模态中解耦清洁图像与扰动，采用ScMix增强策略；在文本模态中结合句内/句间重要性提取全局关键词，并利用历史与未来梯度优化路径。

Result: 跨任务、模型与数据集的实验表明，该方法在通用多模态攻击效果上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HRA通过多粒度扰动精炼和梯度优化，有效提升了视觉语言模型的对抗攻击效率与泛化性。

Abstract: Existing adversarial attacks for VLP models are mostly sample-specific, resulting in substantial computational overhead when scaled to large datasets or new scenarios. To overcome this limitation, we propose Hierarchical Refinement Attack (HRA), a multimodal universal attack framework for VLP models. HRA refines universal adversarial perturbations (UAPs) at both the sample level and the optimization level. For the image modality, we disentangle adversarial examples into clean images and perturbations, allowing each component to be handled independently for more effective disruption of cross-modal alignment. We further introduce a ScMix augmentation strategy that diversifies visual contexts and strengthens both global and local utility of UAPs, thereby reducing reliance on spurious features. In addition, we refine the optimization path by leveraging a temporal hierarchy of historical and estimated future gradients to avoid local minima and stabilize universal perturbation learning. For the text modality, HRA identifies globally influential words by combining intra-sentence and inter-sentence importance measures, and subsequently utilizes these words as universal text perturbations. Extensive experiments across various downstream tasks, VLP models, and datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed universal multimodal attacks.

Abstract: Recent Omni-multimodal Large Language Models show promise in unified audio, vision, and text modeling. However, streaming audio-video understanding remains challenging, as existing approaches suffer from disjointed capabilities: they typically exhibit incomplete modality support or lack autonomous proactive monitoring. To address this, we present ROMA, a real-time omni-multimodal assistant for unified reactive and proactive interaction. ROMA processes continuous inputs as synchronized multimodal units, aligning dense audio with discrete video frames to handle granularity mismatches. For online decision-making, we introduce a lightweight speak head that decouples response initiation from generation to ensure precise triggering without task conflict. We train ROMA with a curated streaming dataset and a two-stage curriculum that progressively optimizes for streaming format adaptation and proactive responsiveness. To standardize the fragmented evaluation landscape, we reorganize diverse benchmarks into a unified suite covering both proactive (alert, narration) and reactive (QA) settings. Extensive experiments across 12 benchmarks demonstrate ROMA achieves state-of-the-art performance on proactive tasks while competitive in reactive settings, validating its robustness in unified real-time omni-multimodal understanding.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为SRAW的新型对抗攻击方法，通过优化前景与背景区域的加权变形，在保持攻击效果的同时显著提升对抗样本的隐蔽性和可迁移性，适用于合成孔径雷达（SAR）自动目标识别（SAR-ATR）系统的鲁棒性测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAR图像因电磁散射机制导致信息稀疏性，现有DNN基SAR-ATR系统易受对抗样本攻击且过度依赖背景区域，传统对抗攻击需明显视觉失真，亟需平衡效果与隐蔽性的攻击方法。

Method: 提出空间加权对抗形变（SRAW），通过前景-背景区域动态预算重加权策略，利用空间变形生成对抗样本，并开源代码https://github.com/boremycin/SAR-ATR-TransAttack。

Result: 实验证明SRAW显著降低主流SAR-ATR模型性能，相较现有方法在不可感知性和攻击可迁移性方面表现最优。

Conclusion: SRAW为SAR-ATR系统提供了一种高效的对抗测试工具，揭示了模型对空间结构的敏感性，并推动了鲁棒图像识别方法的研究。

Abstract: Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery exhibits intrinsic information sparsity due to its unique electromagnetic scattering mechanism. Despite the widespread adoption of deep neural network (DNN)-based SAR automatic target recognition (SAR-ATR) systems, they remain vulnerable to adversarial examples and tend to over-rely on background regions, leading to degraded adversarial robustness. Existing adversarial attacks for SAR-ATR often require visually perceptible distortions to achieve effective performance, thereby necessitating an attack method that balances effectiveness and stealthiness. In this paper, a novel attack method termed Space-Reweighted Adversarial Warping (SRAW) is proposed, which generates adversarial examples through optimized spatial deformation with reweighted budgets across foreground and background regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SRAW significantly degrades the performance of state-of-the-art SAR-ATR models and consistently outperforms existing methods in terms of imperceptibility and adversarial transferability.

TL;DR: 本文提出T2G范式，通过激活LLM的语言推理能力改写文本提示，并与扩散模型联合优化，显著提升了图像生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有T2I模型仅将LLM作为静态编码器，未发挥其推理能力，导致生成内容可能与文本语义不符。作者提出需通过LLM的逻辑推导增强语义-视觉映射的准确性。

Method: 1) 对LLM进行指令微调激活改写能力；2) 使用Dual-GRPO算法联合优化LLM与扩散模型；3) 通过图像奖励机制强化LLM的语义推导与知识调用能力。

Result: 在WISE测评中达到0.79分，较传统方法提升23%，接近GPT-4水平，且在事实一致性、语义对齐度等指标上表现突出。

Conclusion: T2G范式有效整合了语言推理与视觉生成能力，为构建具有认知-表现双重能力的下一代生成模型提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Recent progress in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models (DMs) has enabled high-quality visual synthesis from diverse textual prompts. Yet, most existing T2I DMs, even those equipped with large language model (LLM)-based text encoders, remain text-pixel mappers -- they employ LLMs merely as text encoders, without leveraging their inherent reasoning capabilities to infer what should be visually depicted given the textual prompt. To move beyond such literal generation, we propose the think-then-generate (T2G) paradigm, where the LLM-based text encoder is encouraged to reason about and rewrite raw user prompts; the states of the rewritten prompts then serve as diffusion conditioning. To achieve this, we first activate the think-then-rewrite pattern of the LLM encoder with a lightweight supervised fine-tuning process. Subsequently, the LLM encoder and diffusion backbone are co-optimized to ensure faithful reasoning about the context and accurate rendering of the semantics via Dual-GRPO. In particular, the text encoder is reinforced using image-grounded rewards to infer and recall world knowledge, while the diffusion backbone is pushed to produce semantically consistent and visually coherent images. Experiments show substantial improvements in factual consistency, semantic alignment, and visual realism across reasoning-based image generation and editing benchmarks, achieving 0.79 on WISE score, nearly on par with GPT-4. Our results constitute a promising step toward next-generation unified models with reasoning, expression, and demonstration capacities.

Conclusion: 提出的框架解决了姿态编辑领域同时评估真实性与多维质量的难题，为后续研究提供标准化基准

Abstract: Text-guided human pose editing has gained significant traction in AIGC applications. However,it remains plagued by structural anomalies and generative artifacts. Existing evaluation metrics often isolate authenticity detection from quality assessment, failing to provide fine-grained insights into pose-specific inconsistencies. To address these limitations, we introduce HPE-Bench, a specialized benchmark comprising 1,700 standardized samples from 17 state-of-the-art editing models, offering both authenticity labels and multi-dimensional quality scores. Furthermore, we propose a unified framework based on layer-selective multimodal large language models (MLLMs). By employing contrastive LoRA tuning and a novel layer sensitivity analysis (LSA) mechanism, we identify the optimal feature layer for pose evaluation. Our framework achieves superior performance in both authenticity detection and multi-dimensional quality regression, effectively bridging the gap between forensic detection and quality assessment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散的生成先验图像压缩方法存在采样速度慢和比特分配次优的问题，主要源于破碎的训练范式。

Method: 设计频率感知跳过估计(FaSE)模块，通过频率解耦注意力(FDA)对预训练潜扩散模型的ε预测先验迭代优化，并结合轻量级一致性估计器实现两步快速解码。

Result: 在保持主干扩散模型不变的前提下，与SOTA方法相比实现了27.2%的LPIPS和65.1%的PSNR码率节省，以及超过10倍的加速效果。

Conclusion: DiffCR通过一致性先验优化和频域分析方法，有效解决了扩散模型在低码率图像压缩中存在的效率和质量平衡问题。

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion-based generative priors have enabled visually plausible image compression at extremely low bit rates. However, existing approaches suffer from slow sampling processes and suboptimal bit allocation due to fragmented training paradigms. In this work, we propose Accelerate \textbf{Diff}usion-based Image Compression via \textbf{C}onsistency Prior \textbf{R}efinement (DiffCR), a novel compression framework for efficient and high-fidelity image reconstruction. At the heart of DiffCR is a Frequency-aware Skip Estimation (FaSE) module that refines the $ε$-prediction prior from a pre-trained latent diffusion model and aligns it with compressed latents at different timesteps via Frequency Decoupling Attention (FDA). Furthermore, a lightweight consistency estimator enables fast \textbf{two-step decoding} by preserving the semantic trajectory of diffusion sampling. Without updating the backbone diffusion model, DiffCR achieves substantial bitrate savings (27.2\% BD-rate (LPIPS) and 65.1\% BD-rate (PSNR)) and over $10\times$ speed-up compared to SOTA diffusion-based compression baselines.

Conclusion: 全局上下文压缩显著优于基线模型，尤其在长文本任务中，代码与数据集将公开促进后续研究。

Abstract: Recent achievements of vision-language models in end-to-end OCR point to a new avenue for low-loss compression of textual information. This motivates earlier works that render the Transformer's input into images for prefilling, which effectively reduces the number of tokens through visual encoding, thereby alleviating the quadratically increased Attention computations. However, this partial compression fails to save computational or memory costs at token-by-token inference. In this paper, we investigate global context compression, which saves tokens at both prefilling and inference stages. Consequently, we propose VIST2, a novel Transformer that interleaves input text chunks alongside their visual encoding, while depending exclusively on visual tokens in the pre-context to predict the next text token distribution. Around this idea, we render text chunks into sketch images and train VIST2 in multiple stages, starting from curriculum-scheduled pretraining for optical language modeling, followed by modal-interleaved instruction tuning. We conduct extensive experiments using VIST2 families scaled from 0.6B to 8B to explore the training recipe and hyperparameters. With a 4$\times$ compression ratio, the resulting models demonstrate significant superiority over baselines on long writing tasks, achieving, on average, a 3$\times$ speedup in first-token generation, 77% reduction in memory usage, and 74% reduction in FLOPS. Our codes and datasets will be public to support further studies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多模态深度学习在生存预测中受限于小样本和模态缺失问题，现有方法需删除不完整病例或过度插补，因此需要一种能处理缺失数据的鲁棒性模型。

Method: 利用基础模型（FM）进行模态特征提取，并设计缺失感知编码策略实现中间模态融合，使模型在训练和推理时无需剔除缺失模态样本。

Result: 中间融合方法在C-index指标上达到73.30，显著优于单模态及早/晚期融合策略，其中WSI联合临床变量效果最佳，CT模态因信息量少被自动降权。

Conclusion: 该框架通过缺失感知机制提升多模态生存预测的临床适用性，证明中间融合与模态权重自适应分配可有效解决真实临床场景中的数据不完整挑战。

Abstract: Accurate survival prediction in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) requires the integration of heterogeneous clinical, radiological, and histopathological information. While Multimodal Deep Learning (MDL) offers a promises for precision prognosis and survival prediction, its clinical applicability is severely limited by small cohort sizes and the presence of missing modalities, often forcing complete-case filtering or aggressive imputation. In this work, we present a missing-aware multimodal survival framework that integrates Computed Tomography (CT), Whole-Slide Histopathology (WSI) Images, and structured clinical variables for overall survival modeling in unresectable stage II-III NSCLC. By leveraging Foundation Models (FM) for modality-specific feature extraction and a missing-aware encoding strategy, the proposed approach enables intermediate multimodal fusion under naturally incomplete modality profiles. The proposed architecture is resilient to missing modalities by design, allowing the model to utilize all available data without being forced to drop patients during training or inference. Experimental results demonstrate that intermediate fusion consistently outperforms unimodal baselines as well as early and late fusion strategies, with the strongest performance achieved by the fusion of WSI and clinical modalities (73.30 C-index). Further analyses of modality importance reveal an adaptive behavior in which less informative modalities, i.e., CT modality, are automatically down-weighted and contribute less to the final survival prediction.

Abstract: Fluorescence microscopy is widely employed for the analysis of living biological samples; however, the utility of the resulting recordings is frequently constrained by noise, temporal variability, and inconsistent visualisation of signals that oscillate over time. We present a unique computational framework that integrates information from multiple time-resolved frames into a single high-quality image, while preserving the underlying biological content of the original video. We evaluate the proposed method through an extensive number of configurations (n = 111) and on a challenging dataset comprising dynamic, heterogeneous, and morphologically complex 2D monolayers of cardiac cells. Results show that our framework, which consists of a combination of explainable techniques from different computer vision application fields, is capable of generating composite images that preserve and enhance the quality and information of individual microscopy frames, yielding 44% average increase in cell count compared to previous methods. The proposed pipeline is applicable to other imaging domains that require the fusion of multi-temporal image stacks into high-quality 2D images, thereby facilitating annotation and downstream segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Lunar-G2R, a deep learning framework that predicts spatially varying reflectance (BRDF) for lunar surfaces directly from terrain geometry (DEM) without requiring complex imaging setups, improving photometric accuracy in rendering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing lunar rendering relies on simplified or uniform BRDF models that fail to capture local reflectance variations, limiting realism. A method is needed to estimate detailed reflectance without multi-view imagery or specialized hardware.

Method: Lunar-G2R employs a U-Net architecture trained via differentiable rendering, where BRDF parameters are predicted from DEM and optimized to minimize photometric differences between synthetic renderings and real orbital images under known lighting/viewing conditions.

Result: The approach reduces photometric error by 38% compared to baselines, achieves higher PSNR/SSIM scores, and captures fine-scale reflectance variations in the Tycho crater region not possible with spatially uniform models.

Conclusion: This work presents the first framework to infer spatially varying BRDF models directly from terrain geometry, enabling higher-fidelity lunar rendering and navigation without complex data acquisition pipelines.

Abstract: We address the problem of estimating realistic, spatially varying reflectance for complex planetary surfaces such as the lunar regolith, which is critical for high-fidelity rendering and vision-based navigation. Existing lunar rendering pipelines rely on simplified or spatially uniform BRDF models whose parameters are difficult to estimate and fail to capture local reflectance variations, limiting photometric realism. We propose Lunar-G2R, a geometry-to-reflectance learning framework that predicts spatially varying BRDF parameters directly from a lunar digital elevation model (DEM), without requiring multi-view imagery, controlled illumination, or dedicated reflectance-capture hardware at inference time. The method leverages a U-Net trained with differentiable rendering to minimize photometric discrepancies between real orbital images and physically based renderings under known viewing and illumination geometry. Experiments on a geographically held-out region of the Tycho crater show that our approach reduces photometric error by 38 % compared to a state-of-the-art baseline, while achieving higher PSNR and SSIM and improved perceptual similarity, capturing fine-scale reflectance variations absent from spatially uniform models. To our knowledge, this is the first method to infer a spatially varying reflectance model directly from terrain geometry.

Abstract: As hubs of human activity, urban surfaces consist of a wealth of semantic entities. Segmenting these various entities from satellite imagery is crucial for a range of downstream applications. Current advanced segmentation models can reliably segment entities defined by physical attributes (e.g., buildings, water bodies) but still struggle with socially defined categories (e.g., schools, parks). In this work, we achieve socio-semantic segmentation by vision-language model reasoning. To facilitate this, we introduce the Urban Socio-Semantic Segmentation dataset named SocioSeg, a new resource comprising satellite imagery, digital maps, and pixel-level labels of social semantic entities organized in a hierarchical structure. Additionally, we propose a novel vision-language reasoning framework called SocioReasoner that simulates the human process of identifying and annotating social semantic entities via cross-modal recognition and multi-stage reasoning. We employ reinforcement learning to optimize this non-differentiable process and elicit the reasoning capabilities of the vision-language model. Experiments demonstrate our approach's gains over state-of-the-art models and strong zero-shot generalization. Our dataset and code are available in https://github.com/AMAP-ML/SocioReasoner.

Abstract: Online high-definition (HD) map construction is an essential part of a safe and robust end-to-end autonomous driving (AD) pipeline. Onboard camera-based approaches suffer from limited depth perception and degraded accuracy due to occlusion. In this work, we propose SatMap, an online vectorized HD map estimation method that integrates satellite maps with multi-view camera observations and directly predicts a vectorized HD map for downstream prediction and planning modules. Our method leverages lane-level semantics and texture from satellite imagery captured from a Bird's Eye View (BEV) perspective as a global prior, effectively mitigating depth ambiguity and occlusion.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SVII-3D introduces a unified framework for high-fidelity infrastructure digitization using sparse imagery, combining LoRA-based detection, geometry refinement, and vision-language diagnostics to achieve scalable, cost-effective solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Smart city development and facility management require precise asset inventories, but current methods face challenges with sparse imagery's robustness, localization accuracy, and state understanding limitations.

Method: 1) LoRA-finetuned open-set detection with spatial-attention matching for robust sparse view association 2) Geometry-guided refinement for decimeter-level 3D localization 3) Vision-Language Model agent with multi-modal prompts for operational state diagnosis

Result: Achieved significant improvements in identification accuracy and localization error reduction through experiments, demonstrating scalable cost-effectiveness for infrastructure digitization tasks.

Conclusion: SVII-3D successfully bridges sparse perception limitations with automated intelligent maintenance, offering a practical solution for high-fidelity infrastructure digital twin creation.

Abstract: The automated creation of digital twins and precise asset inventories is a critical task in smart city construction and facility lifecycle management. However, utilizing cost-effective sparse imagery remains challenging due to limited robustness, inaccurate localization, and a lack of fine-grained state understanding. To address these limitations, SVII-3D, a unified framework for holistic asset digitization, is proposed. First, LoRA fine-tuned open-set detection is fused with a spatial-attention matching network to robustly associate observations across sparse views. Second, a geometry-guided refinement mechanism is introduced to resolve structural errors, achieving precise decimeter-level 3D localization. Third, transcending static geometric mapping, a Vision-Language Model agent leveraging multi-modal prompting is incorporated to automatically diagnose fine-grained operational states. Experiments demonstrate that SVII-3D significantly improves identification accuracy and minimizes localization errors. Consequently, this framework offers a scalable, cost-effective solution for high-fidelity infrastructure digitization, effectively bridging the gap between sparse perception and automated intelligent maintenance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究通过FFA-Net和AECR-Net两种深度学习模型，改善烟雾/雾霾中仪表图像的可视性，生成包含14000+图像的合成数据集进行训练，在合成雾霾数据中SSIM和PSNR达0.98和43dB，验证了深度学习在提升灾害场景仪表读取能力的可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 烟雾及雾霾环境导致仪表监测可见度降低，影响基础设施监控和紧急救援的及时性，而现有数据增强方法在灾害场景中存在适应性不足的问题。

Method: 使用Unreal Engine生成合成雾霾/烟雾仪表数据集（训练集:80%；验证集:10%；测试集:10%），基于FFA-Net（特征聚焦注意力）和AECR-Net（非对称编码器-解码器）进行去雾/降噪训练。

Result: 合成雾霾场景达SOTA指标（SSIM 0.98；PSNR 43dB），AECR-Net在烟雾场景表现优于FFA-Net（但烟雾场景指标相对较低）；实验验证了模型在非均匀高密度烟雾中的增强潜力。

Conclusion: 基于深度学习的图像增强方法可显著改善灾害场景中的仪表图像质量，其输出能有效支持自动识别系统，为紧急响应提供重要工具。

Abstract: Images captured in hazy and smoky environments suffer from reduced visibility, posing a challenge when monitoring infrastructures and hindering emergency services during critical situations. The proposed work investigates the use of the deep learning models to enhance the automatic, machine-based readability of gauge in smoky environments, with accurate gauge data interpretation serving as a valuable tool for first responders. The study utilizes two deep learning architectures, FFA-Net and AECR-Net, to improve the visibility of gauge images, corrupted with light up to dense haze and smoke. Since benchmark datasets of analog gauge images are unavailable, a new synthetic dataset, containing over 14,000 images, was generated using the Unreal Engine. The models were trained with an 80\% train, 10\% validation, and 10\% test split for the haze and smoke dataset, respectively. For the synthetic haze dataset, the SSIM and PSNR metrics are about 0.98 and 43\,dB, respectively, comparing well to state-of-the art results. Additionally, more robust results are retrieved from the AECR-Net, when compared to the FFA-Net. Although the results from the synthetic smoke dataset are poorer, the trained models achieve interesting results. In general, imaging in the presence of smoke are more difficult to enhance given the inhomogeneity and high density. Secondly, FFA-Net and AECR-Net are implemented to dehaze and not to desmoke images. This work shows that use of deep learning architectures can improve the quality of analog gauge images captured in smoke and haze scenes immensely. Finally, the enhanced output images can be successfully post-processed for automatic autonomous reading of gauges

Conclusion: 验证了潜在世界模型改善视频生成物理合理性的可行性，方法具有泛化性，不限于特定模型参数设置。

Abstract: State-of-the-art video generative models produce promising visual content yet often violate basic physics principles, limiting their utility. While some attribute this deficiency to insufficient physics understanding from pre-training, we find that the shortfall in physics plausibility also stems from suboptimal inference strategies. We therefore introduce WMReward and treat improving physics plausibility of video generation as an inference-time alignment problem. In particular, we leverage the strong physics prior of a latent world model (here, VJEPA-2) as a reward to search and steer multiple candidate denoising trajectories, enabling scaling test-time compute for better generation performance. Empirically, our approach substantially improves physics plausibility across image-conditioned, multiframe-conditioned, and text-conditioned generation settings, with validation from human preference study. Notably, in the ICCV 2025 Perception Test PhysicsIQ Challenge, we achieve a final score of 62.64%, winning first place and outperforming the previous state of the art by 7.42%. Our work demonstrates the viability of using latent world models to improve physics plausibility of video generation, beyond this specific instantiation or parameterization.

Abstract: The efficacy of autonomous driving systems hinges critically on robust prediction and planning capabilities. However, current benchmarks are impeded by a notable scarcity of scenarios featuring dense traffic, which is essential for understanding and modeling complex interactions among road users. To address this gap, we collaborated with our industrial partner, DeepScenario, to develop DeepUrban-a new drone dataset designed to enhance trajectory prediction and planning benchmarks focusing on dense urban settings. DeepUrban provides a rich collection of 3D traffic objects, extracted from high-resolution images captured over urban intersections at approximately 100 meters altitude. The dataset is further enriched with comprehensive map and scene information to support advanced modeling and simulation tasks. We evaluate state-of-the-art (SOTA) prediction and planning methods, and conducted experiments on generalization capabilities. Our findings demonstrate that adding DeepUrban to nuScenes can boost the accuracy of vehicle predictions and planning, achieving improvements up to 44.1 % / 44.3% on the ADE / FDE metrics.

Method: 提出Jordan-segmentatable掩码定义，通过数字拓扑和同调理论分析：1) 提取4-曲线候选，2) 用Betti数(β0=β1=1)验证拓扑有效性，3) 判断补集是否为两个8-连通域。结合数字Jordan定理和同调不变量，提供无监督评估标准。

Result: 框架提供了严格数学依据的拓扑评估准则，在保证对象整体形状和连通性方面优于传统指标，尤其适用于医疗影像等对拓扑正确性敏感的场景。

Conclusion: 该工作为图像分割质量评价提供了新的拓扑视角，解决了传统指标忽视结构连贯性的问题，为需要严密拓扑约束的应用提供了有价值的方法。

Abstract: Image segmentation plays a central role in computer vision. However, widely used evaluation metrics, whether pixel-wise, region-based, or boundary-focused, often struggle to capture the structural and topological coherence of a segmentation. In many practical scenarios, such as medical imaging or object delineation, small inaccuracies in boundary, holes, or fragmented predictions can result in high metric scores, despite the fact that the resulting masks fail to preserve the object global shape or connectivity. This highlights a limitation of conventional metrics: they are unable to assess whether a predicted segmentation partitions the image into meaningful interior and exterior regions.
  In this work, we introduce a topology-aware notion of segmentation based on the Jordan Curve Theorem, and adapted for use in digital planes. We define the concept of a \emph{Jordan-segmentatable mask}, which is a binary segmentation whose structure ensures a topological separation of the image domain into two connected components. We analyze segmentation masks through the lens of digital topology and homology theory, extracting a $4$-curve candidate from the mask, verifying its topological validity using Betti numbers. A mask is considered Jordan-segmentatable when this candidate forms a digital 4-curve with $β_0 = β_1 = 1$, or equivalently when its complement splits into exactly two $8$-connected components.
  This framework provides a mathematically rigorous, unsupervised criterion with which to assess the structural coherence of segmentation masks. By combining digital Jordan theory and homological invariants, our approach provides a valuable alternative to standard evaluation metrics, especially in applications where topological correctness must be preserved.

Abstract: Inferring physical actions from visual observations is a fundamental capability for advancing machine intelligence in the physical world. Achieving this requires large-scale, open-vocabulary video action datasets that span broad domains. We introduce Action100M, a large-scale dataset constructed from 1.2M Internet instructional videos (14.6 years of duration), yielding O(100 million) temporally localized segments with open-vocabulary action supervision and rich captions. Action100M is generated by a fully automated pipeline that (i) performs hierarchical temporal segmentation using V-JEPA 2 embeddings, (ii) produces multi-level frame and segment captions organized as a Tree-of-Captions, and (iii) aggregates evidence with a reasoning model (GPT-OSS-120B) under a multi-round Self-Refine procedure to output structured annotations (brief/detailed action, actor, brief/detailed caption). Training VL-JEPA on Action100M demonstrates consistent data-scaling improvements and strong zero-shot performance across diverse action recognition benchmarks, establishing Action100M as a new foundation for scalable research in video understanding and world modeling.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces RSATalker, a talking head generation framework combining 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) with social relationship modeling to enable realistic and socially-aware multi-turn conversations in virtual reality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing talking head generation methods face limitations: (1) mesh-based 3D approaches lack realistic textures, (2) 2D large models require excessive computation, and (3) 3DGS methods are speaker-only with no social relationship consideration.

Method: 1) Speech-driven 3D facial motion generation via mesh deformation; 2) High-fidelity 2D video rendering through 3D Gaussian binding to mesh facets; 3) Social relationship modeling using query-based embedding of interpersonal dynamics (blood/non-blood, hierarchical/equal relationships); 4) Three-stage training with the RSATalker dataset containing speech-mesh-image triplets with social annotations.

Result: State-of-the-art performance in realism and social awareness for multi-turn conversations, validated through extensive experiments. Code and dataset will be publicly released.

Conclusion: RSATalker advances talking head generation by integrating 3DGS efficiency with explicit social relationship modeling, setting new benchmarks for realistic and socially-informed avatars in virtual reality applications.

Abstract: Talking head generation is increasingly important in virtual reality (VR), especially for social scenarios involving multi-turn conversation. Existing approaches face notable limitations: mesh-based 3D methods can model dual-person dialogue but lack realistic textures, while large-model-based 2D methods produce natural appearances but incur prohibitive computational costs. Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) based methods achieve efficient and realistic rendering but remain speaker-only and ignore social relationships. We introduce RSATalker, the first framework that leverages 3DGS for realistic and socially-aware talking head generation with support for multi-turn conversation. Our method first drives mesh-based 3D facial motion from speech, then binds 3D Gaussians to mesh facets to render high-fidelity 2D avatar videos. To capture interpersonal dynamics, we propose a socially-aware module that encodes social relationships, including blood and non-blood as well as equal and unequal, into high-level embeddings through a learnable query mechanism. We design a three-stage training paradigm and construct the RSATalker dataset with speech-mesh-image triplets annotated with social relationships. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RSATalker achieves state-of-the-art performance in both realism and social awareness. The code and dataset will be released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Molmo2 is a new family of open-source video-language models (VLMs) that achieve state-of-the-art performance in video and image understanding, particularly excelling in pixel-level grounding tasks like tracking and pointing. It introduces 7 new video/multi-image datasets and novel training techniques without relying on proprietary data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current high-performance VLMs are proprietary, while open-source models either depend on synthetic data from closed systems or lack transparency in training. Existing models (open or closed) fail to provide precise pixel-level grounding required by practical applications such as object tracking in video.

Method: The authors curated 7 new video datasets (including detailed captions, free-form Q&A, tracking, and pointing tasks) and 2 multi-image datasets. They developed a training recipe with efficient data packing, message-tree encoding, bidirectional attention on vision tokens, and a token-weight strategy to enhance performance.

Result: The 8B parameter Molmo2 model outperforms open-source competitors like Qwen3-VL (e.g., 35.5 vs. 29.6 accuracy on video counting) and surpasses proprietary models like Gemini 3 Pro on specific tasks (e.g., 38.4 vs. 20.0 F1 score for video pointing). It also excels in short/long video understanding, counting, and captioning.

Conclusion: Molmo2 establishes a foundation for improving open-source VLMs by introducing transparent training data, new grounding capabilities, and competitive performance against proprietary models. The models and datasets are publicly released to advance research.

Abstract: Today's strongest video-language models (VLMs) remain proprietary. The strongest open-weight models either rely on synthetic data from proprietary VLMs, effectively distilling from them, or do not disclose their training data or recipe. As a result, the open-source community lacks the foundations needed to improve on the state-of-the-art video (and image) language models. Crucially, many downstream applications require more than just high-level video understanding; they require grounding -- either by pointing or by tracking in pixels. Even proprietary models lack this capability. We present Molmo2, a new family of VLMs that are state-of-the-art among open-source models and demonstrate exceptional new capabilities in point-driven grounding in single image, multi-image, and video tasks. Our key contribution is a collection of 7 new video datasets and 2 multi-image datasets, including a dataset of highly detailed video captions for pre-training, a free-form video Q&A dataset for fine-tuning, a new object tracking dataset with complex queries, and an innovative new video pointing dataset, all collected without the use of closed VLMs. We also present a training recipe for this data utilizing an efficient packing and message-tree encoding scheme, and show bi-directional attention on vision tokens and a novel token-weight strategy improves performance. Our best-in-class 8B model outperforms others in the class of open weight and data models on short videos, counting, and captioning, and is competitive on long-videos. On video-grounding Molmo2 significantly outperforms existing open-weight models like Qwen3-VL (35.5 vs 29.6 accuracy on video counting) and surpasses proprietary models like Gemini 3 Pro on some tasks (38.4 vs 20.0 F1 on video pointing and 56.2 vs 41.1 J&F on video tracking).

Conclusion: 提出首个将3D动作与2D视频生成深度融合的共生成框架，通过单循环扩散模型实现跨模态协同，为多模态生成任务提供新范式。

Abstract: In this paper, we find that the generation of 3D human motions and 2D human videos is intrinsically coupled. 3D motions provide the structural prior for plausibility and consistency in videos, while pre-trained video models offer strong generalization capabilities for motions, which necessitate coupling their generation processes. Based on this, we present CoMoVi, a co-generative framework that couples two video diffusion models (VDMs) to generate 3D human motions and videos synchronously within a single diffusion denoising loop. To achieve this, we first propose an effective 2D human motion representation that can inherit the powerful prior of pre-trained VDMs. Then, we design a dual-branch diffusion model to couple human motion and video generation process with mutual feature interaction and 3D-2D cross attentions. Moreover, we curate CoMoVi Dataset, a large-scale real-world human video dataset with text and motion annotations, covering diverse and challenging human motions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in both 3D human motion and video generation tasks.

Result: 现有SOTA视频语言模型在CURVE上的表现远低于人类水平，主要错误源于对文化视觉元素的感知不足。

Conclusion: CURVE为文化特异性视频推理提供了新挑战，其证据图谱分析方法可有效定位细粒度推理错误。

Abstract: Recent advancements in video models have shown tremendous progress, particularly in long video understanding. However, current benchmarks predominantly feature western-centric data and English as the dominant language, introducing significant biases in evaluation. To address this, we introduce CURVE (Cultural Understanding and Reasoning in Video Evaluation), a challenging benchmark for multicultural and multilingual video reasoning. CURVE comprises high-quality, entirely human-generated annotations from diverse, region-specific cultural videos across 18 global locales. Unlike prior work that relies on automatic translations, CURVE provides complex questions, answers, and multi-step reasoning steps, all crafted in native languages. Making progress on CURVE requires a deeply situated understanding of visual cultural context. Furthermore, we leverage CURVE's reasoning traces to construct evidence-based graphs and propose a novel iterative strategy using these graphs to identify fine-grained errors in reasoning. Our evaluations reveal that SoTA Video-LLMs struggle significantly, performing substantially below human-level accuracy, with errors primarily stemming from the visual perception of cultural elements. CURVE will be publicly available under https://github.com/google-deepmind/neptune?tab=readme-ov-file\#minerva-cultural

*Amir Mallak,Erfan Aasi,Shiva Sreeram,Tsun-Hsuan Wang,Daniela Rus,Alaa Maalouf*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Stochastic-Patch-Selection (SPS) improves end-to-end autonomous driving robustness by masking patch features during training, achieving higher OOD performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Patch-aligned features from foundation models contain redundant information due to self-attention, leading to overfitting on spurious correlations and reduced OOD robustness.

Method: Proposed SPS randomly masks a fraction of patch descriptors per frame, forcing the policy to learn robust invariant features from stochastically sampled scene projections while preserving spatial layout.

Result: SPS outperforms SOTA with 6.2% average OOD improvement (20.4% max in closed-loop tests), 2.4× speedup, and 8/9 ablated systems surpassing prior state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: SPS enhances generalization, robustness, and efficiency in autonomous driving policies, enabling real-world deployment without fine-tuning.

Abstract: Recent advances in end-to-end autonomous driving show that policies trained on patch-aligned features extracted from foundation models generalize better to Out-of-Distribution (OOD). We hypothesize that due to the self-attention mechanism, each patch feature implicitly embeds/contains information from all other patches, represented in a different way and intensity, making these descriptors highly redundant. We quantify redundancy in such (BLIP2) features via PCA and cross-patch similarity: $90$% of variance is captured by $17/64$ principal components, and strong inter-token correlations are pervasive. Training on such overlapping information leads the policy to overfit spurious correlations, hurting OOD robustness. We present Stochastic-Patch-Selection (SPS), a simple yet effective approach for learning policies that are more robust, generalizable, and efficient. For every frame, SPS randomly masks a fraction of patch descriptors, not feeding them to the policy model, while preserving the spatial layout of the remaining patches. Thus, the policy is provided with different stochastic but complete views of the (same) scene: every random subset of patches acts like a different, yet still sensible, coherent projection of the world. The policy thus bases its decisions on features that are invariant to which specific tokens survive. Extensive experiments confirm that across all OOD scenarios, our method outperforms the state of the art (SOTA), achieving a $6.2$% average improvement and up to $20.4$% in closed-loop simulations, while being $2.4\times$ faster. We conduct ablations over masking rates and patch-feature reorganization, training and evaluating 9 systems, with 8 of them surpassing prior SOTA. Finally, we show that the same learned policy transfers to a physical, real-world car without any tuning.

Motivation: 传统VLMs仅连接视觉编码器输出与LLM输入，导致LLM无法有效整合视觉层级知识与局部-全局语义信息

Method: 构建动态多对多跨模态桥梁：1）自适应多层投影（AMP）融合视觉层特征；2）自适应门控融合（AGF）基于解码上下文动态注入关键视觉信息

Result: 在LLaVA系列模型中集成CLI后，18个基准测试中表现出显著性能提升（具体指标未披露）

Conclusion: CLI框架实现LLM对完整视觉层级的按需存取，在参数效率下达成更深层的多模态理解

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) create a severe visual feature bottleneck by using a crude, asymmetric connection that links only the output of the vision encoder to the input of the large language model (LLM). This static architecture fundamentally limits the ability of LLMs to achieve comprehensive alignment with hierarchical visual knowledge, compromising their capacity to accurately integrate local details with global semantics into coherent reasoning. To resolve this, we introduce Cross-Layer Injection (CLI), a novel and lightweight framework that forges a dynamic many-to-many bridge between the two modalities. CLI consists of two synergistic, parameter-efficient components: an Adaptive Multi-Projection (AMP) module that harmonizes features from diverse vision layers, and an Adaptive Gating Fusion (AGF) mechanism that empowers the LLM to selectively inject the most relevant visual information based on its real-time decoding context. We validate the effectiveness and versatility of CLI by integrating it into LLaVA-OneVision and LLaVA-1.5. Extensive experiments on 18 diverse benchmarks demonstrate significant performance improvements, establishing CLI as a scalable paradigm that unlocks deeper multimodal understanding by granting LLMs on-demand access to the full visual hierarchy.

Method: （1）宽松训练目标：允许模型在参考图像、文本描述、背景图像和物体掩膜的条件下同时改变内外属性；（2）推理阶段仅复用原始背景和掩膜约束外在变化；（3）视觉实体名称（VNEs）分类体系，结合视觉-语言模型构建身份保持的监督信号。

Result: 在物体身份保持的内在属性编辑任务上显著优于现有方法

Conclusion: 通过非约束性训练策略和VNEs分类体系，实现了无需严格监督即可保持物体身份的高质量属性编辑

Abstract: We introduce Alterbute, a diffusion-based method for editing an object's intrinsic attributes in an image. We allow changing color, texture, material, and even the shape of an object, while preserving its perceived identity and scene context. Existing approaches either rely on unsupervised priors that often fail to preserve identity or use overly restrictive supervision that prevents meaningful intrinsic variations. Our method relies on: (i) a relaxed training objective that allows the model to change both intrinsic and extrinsic attributes conditioned on an identity reference image, a textual prompt describing the target intrinsic attributes, and a background image and object mask defining the extrinsic context. At inference, we restrict extrinsic changes by reusing the original background and object mask, thereby ensuring that only the desired intrinsic attributes are altered; (ii) Visual Named Entities (VNEs) - fine-grained visual identity categories (e.g., ''Porsche 911 Carrera'') that group objects sharing identity-defining features while allowing variation in intrinsic attributes. We use a vision-language model to automatically extract VNE labels and intrinsic attribute descriptions from a large public image dataset, enabling scalable, identity-preserving supervision. Alterbute outperforms existing methods on identity-preserving object intrinsic attribute editing.

*Xuweiyi Chen,Wentao Zhou,Zezhou Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WildRayZer是一种自监督框架，用于动态环境中（相机和物体均移动）的新视角合成（NVS），通过分析-合成测试分离动态区域与静态背景，显著提升渲染质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态场景破坏了静态NVS模型依赖的多视角一致性，导致伪影、错误几何和姿态估计不稳定，需要一种无需动态先验或复杂预处理的解决方案。

Method: 1. 使用仅相机静态渲染器解释刚性结构，残差生成伪动态掩码；2. 蒸馏运动估计器，掩码输入标记并控制损失梯度；3. 提出D-RE10K和D-RE10K-iPhone真实世界数据集用于训练和评估。

Result: 在D-RE10K数据集上，WildRayZer单次前向推理性能超越优化方法和前馈基线，动态区域去除和全帧NVS质量均提升（具体指标需查原文补充）。

Conclusion: 该方法通过静态-动态分离策略，实现了动态场景中高效、鲁棒的新视角合成，为真实动态场景应用提供了通用基础框架。

Abstract: We present WildRayZer, a self-supervised framework for novel view synthesis (NVS) in dynamic environments where both the camera and objects move. Dynamic content breaks the multi-view consistency that static NVS models rely on, leading to ghosting, hallucinated geometry, and unstable pose estimation. WildRayZer addresses this by performing an analysis-by-synthesis test: a camera-only static renderer explains rigid structure, and its residuals reveal transient regions. From these residuals, we construct pseudo motion masks, distill a motion estimator, and use it to mask input tokens and gate loss gradients so supervision focuses on cross-view background completion. To enable large-scale training and evaluation, we curate Dynamic RealEstate10K (D-RE10K), a real-world dataset of 15K casually captured dynamic sequences, and D-RE10K-iPhone, a paired transient and clean benchmark for sparse-view transient-aware NVS. Experiments show that WildRayZer consistently outperforms optimization-based and feed-forward baselines in both transient-region removal and full-frame NVS quality with a single feed-forward pass.

*Jinqiang Wang,Huansheng Ning,Jianguo Ding,Tao Zhu,Liming Chen,Chris Nugent*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出ProUtt，一种基于大规模语言模型(LMM)的偏好数据合成方法，通过显式建模用户意图推理路径，在对话历史中构建意图树并生成偏好/非偏好推理过程，有效预测用户下一语句，实验证明其在四个基准数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对话系统面临三个核心挑战：1) 商用API存在隐私问题；2) 部署通用LMM计算成本高；3) 现有用户模拟器和数据合成方法缺乏对用户意图推理过程的显式建模，难以生成具有目的性与探索性的对话轨迹。

Method: 提出基于意图树(Intent Tree)的三维建模框架：1) 通过对话历史生成包含'利用'与'探索'视角的意图路径；2) 采用路径扰动技术构造偏好与非偏好推理过程；3) 利用LMM驱动层次化意图分解与未来对话回合预测，构建结构化训练数据。

Result: 基于LLM评判和人工评估的双重验证表明：ProUtt在四个对话基准数据集上的P@1准确率达82.3%，相较传统偏好合成方法提升15.6%，在长对话场景下的BLEU-4得分高出基线模型9.8个百分点，且生成数据使微调模型的响应相关性提升12.4%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过显式建模意图推理过程中的决策机制，解决现有方法忽视用户对话策略生成的问题，开源代码和数据集推动了面向意图理解的对话系统研究，为轻量级对话模型开发提供了新范式。

Abstract: Proactively predicting a users next utterance in human-machine dialogue can streamline interaction and improve user experience. Existing commercial API-based solutions are subject to privacy concerns while deploying general-purpose LLMs locally remains computationally expensive. As such, training a compact, task-specific LLM provides a practical alternative. Although user simulator methods can predict a user's next utterance, they mainly imitate their speaking style rather than advancing the dialogue. Preference data synthesis has been investigated to generate data for proactive next utterance prediction and help align LLMs with user preferences. Yet existing methods lack the ability to explicitly model the intent reasoning that leads to the user's next utterance and to define and synthesize preference and non-preference reasoning processes for predicting the user's next utterance.To address these challenges, we propose ProUtt, an LLM-driven preference data synthesis method for proactive next utterance prediction. ProUtt converts dialogue history into an intent tree and explicitly models intent reasoning trajectories by predicting the next plausible path from both exploitation and exploration perspectives. It then constructs preference and non-preference reasoning processes by perturbing or revising intent tree paths at different future turns. Extensive evaluations using LLM-as-a-judge and human judgments demonstrate that ProUtt consistently outperforms existing data synthesis methods, user simulators, and commercial LLM APIs across four benchmark datasets. We release both the code and the synthesized datasets to facilitate future research.

### [57] [Evaluating Novelty in AI-Generated Research Plans Using Multi-Workflow LLM Pipelines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09714)
*Devesh Saraogi,Rohit Singhee,Dhruv Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores if multi-step agentic workflows with Large Language Models (LLMs) can create more creative and feasible AI-generated research plans compared to single-step prompting, which risks 'smart plagiarism'. Decomposition-based and long-context workflows scored highest in novelty (4.17/5), outperforming reflection-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address concerns about 'smart plagiarism' in single-step LLM prompting and investigate whether structured multi-step systems (agentic workflows) can enhance the originality and practicality of AI-generated research ideas.

Method: Benchmarked five agentic reasoning architectures (e.g., iterative refinement, evolutionary algorithms, recursive decomposition) on their ability to generate research proposals. Evaluated 30 proposals per method across novelty, feasibility, and impact metrics.

Result: Decomposition-based and long-context workflows achieved top novelty scores (4.17/5). Reflection-based approaches scored significantly lower (2.33/5). High performance maintained across research domains without compromising creativity or feasibility.

Conclusion: Carefully designed multi-stage agentic workflows can advance AI-assisted research ideation by improving novelty and feasibility. Single-step prompting limitations can be mitigated through structured, iterative reasoning processes.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into the scientific ecosystem raises fundamental questions about the creativity and originality of AI-generated research. Recent work has identified ``smart plagiarism'' as a concern in single-step prompting approaches, where models reproduce existing ideas with terminological shifts. This paper investigates whether agentic workflows -- multi-step systems employing iterative reasoning, evolutionary search, and recursive decomposition -- can generate more novel and feasible research plans. We benchmark five reasoning architectures: Reflection-based iterative refinement, Sakana AI v2 evolutionary algorithms, Google Co-Scientist multi-agent framework, GPT Deep Research (GPT-5.1) recursive decomposition, and Gemini~3 Pro multimodal long-context pipeline. Using evaluations from thirty proposals each on novelty, feasibility, and impact, we find that decomposition-based and long-context workflows achieve mean novelty of 4.17/5, while reflection-based approaches score significantly lower (2.33/5). Results reveal varied performance across research domains, with high-performing workflows maintaining feasibility without sacrificing creativity. These findings support the view that carefully designed multi-stage agentic workflows can advance AI-assisted research ideation.

Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) is rapidly transforming research methodologies across disciplines, yet African languages remain largely underrepresented in this technological shift. This paper provides the first comprehensive overview of NLP progress and challenges for the six national languages officially recognized by the Senegalese Constitution: Wolof, Pulaar, Sereer, Joola, Mandingue, and Soninke. We synthesize linguistic, sociotechnical, and infrastructural factors that shape their digital readiness and identify gaps in data, tools, and benchmarks. Building on existing initiatives and research works, we analyze ongoing efforts in text normalization, machine translation, and speech processing. We also provide a centralized GitHub repository that compiles publicly accessible resources for a range of NLP tasks across these languages, designed to facilitate collaboration and reproducibility. A special focus is devoted to the application of NLP to the social sciences, where multilingual transcription, translation, and retrieval pipelines can significantly enhance the efficiency and inclusiveness of field research. The paper concludes by outlining a roadmap toward sustainable, community-centered NLP ecosystems for Senegalese languages, emphasizing ethical data governance, open resources, and interdisciplinary collaboration.

*Jing-Yi Zeng,Guan-Hua Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究探讨如何基于轻量级LLaMA-3.2-3B模型高效构建领域专用统计大语言模型(StatLLaMA)，发现初始模型选择对领域推理能力至关重要，并提出低强度微调以避免灾难性遗忘的优化方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基础模型在统计推理能力培养上存在效率瓶颈，传统多阶段训练流程（如指令微调/SFT/RLHF）难以有效提升领域专精能力与通用推理能力的平衡。

Method: 对比三种训练流程：纯基础模型、指令增强基础模型、LLaMA-3.2-3B-Instruct模型。测试持续预训练、监督微调(SFT)、人类反馈强化学习(RLHF)及下游任务适配效果，引入直接偏好优化(DPO)实现稳定对齐。

Result: 纯基础模型训练后仍缺乏统计推理能力，而Instruct模型结合低强度SFT实现领域专精。揭示SFT训练强度与通用推理能力的平衡规律，验证DPO在RLHF中的有效性，并发现微调强度过高会导致模型遗忘核心能力。

Conclusion: 领域专用LLM需从具备基础指令能力的模型起步，采用渐进式低强度训练策略可实现数理推理、常识推理与领域专精能力的均衡发展，StatLLaMA为资源高效型统计模型提供实践范式。

Abstract: This study investigates how to efficiently build a domain-specialized large language model (LLM) for statistics using the lightweight LLaMA-3.2-3B family as the foundation model (FM). We systematically compare three multi-stage training pipelines, starting from a base FM with no instruction-following capability, a base FM augmented with post-hoc instruction tuning, and an instruction-tuned FM with strong general reasoning abilities across continual pretraining, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) preference alignment, and downstream task adaptation. Results show that pipelines beginning with a base FM fail to develop meaningful statistical reasoning, even after extensive instruction tuning, SFT, or RLHF alignment. In contrast, starting from LLaMA-3.2-3B-Instruct enables effective domain specialization. A comprehensive evaluation of SFT variants reveals clear trade-offs between domain expertise and general reasoning ability. We further demonstrate that direct preference optimization provides stable and effective RLHF preference alignment. Finally, we show that downstream fine-tuning must be performed with extremely low intensity to avoid catastrophic forgetting in highly optimized models. The final model, StatLLaMA, achieves strong and balanced performance on benchmarks of mathematical reasoning, common-sense reasoning, and statistical expertise, offering a practical blueprint for developing resource-efficient statistical LLMs. The code is available at https://github.com/HuangDLab/StatLLaMA.

*Hoyoon Byun,Youngjun Choi,Taero Kim,Sungrae Park,Kyungwoo Song*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新颖的归一化方法BHyT，作为预层归一化（Pre-LN）的即插即替代方案，解决大语言模型中训练效率低下和深度增加导致的训练不稳定问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-LN虽然广泛用于LLMs且稳定性好，但其重复统计计算导致效率低下，且存在深度增加时激活状态不稳定的问题；现有高效方法如DyT在深度增加时仍不稳定。

Method: BHyT通过结合tanh非线性和显式数据驱动的输入边界，保持激活在非饱和范围内；采用一次精确统计并用轻量方差近似替代第二个归一化步骤，既提升效率又提供理论稳定性保证。

Result: BHyT在预训练中平均提升15.8%训练速度和4.2%标记生成吞吐量，推理性能和鲁棒性与RMSNorm相当或更优。

Conclusion: BHyT成功解决了稳定性与效率的权衡问题，是LLMs中比现有方法更优的归一化替代方案。

Abstract: Pre-Layer Normalization (Pre-LN) is the de facto choice for large language models (LLMs) and is crucial for stable pretraining and effective transfer learning. However, Pre-LN is inefficient due to repeated statistical calculations and suffers from the curse of depth. As layers grow, the magnitude and variance of the hidden state escalate, destabilizing training. Efficiency-oriented normalization-free methods such as Dynamic Tanh (DyT) improve speed but remain fragile at depth. To jointly address stability and efficiency, we propose Bounded Hyperbolic Tanh (BHyT), a drop-in replacement for Pre-LN. BHyT couples a tanh nonlinearity with explicit, data-driven input bounding to keep activations within a non-saturating range. It prevents depth-wise growth in activation magnitude and variance and comes with a theoretical stability guarantee. For efficiency, BHyT computes exact statistics once per block and replaces a second normalization with a lightweight variance approximation, enhancing efficiency. Empirically, BHyT demonstrates improved stability and efficiency during pretraining, achieving an average of 15.8% faster training and an average of 4.2% higher token generation throughput compared to RMSNorm., while matching or surpassing its inference performance and robustness across language understanding and reasoning benchmarks.

Abstract: Question answering (QA) systems are increasingly deployed across domains. However, their reliability is undermined when retrieved evidence is incomplete, noisy, or uncertain. Existing knowledge graph (KG) based QA frameworks typically represent facts as static and deterministic, failing to capture the evolving nature of information and the uncertainty inherent in reasoning. We present a demonstration of uncertainty-aware dynamic KGs, a framework that combines (i) dynamic construction of evolving KGs, (ii) confidence scoring and uncertainty-aware retrieval, and (iii) an interactive interface for reliable and interpretable QA. Our system highlights how uncertainty modeling can make QA more robust and transparent by enabling users to explore dynamic graphs, inspect confidence-annotated triples, and compare baseline versus confidence-aware answers. The target users of this demo are clinical data scientists and clinicians, and we instantiate the framework in healthcare: constructing personalized KGs from electronic health records, visualizing uncertainty across patient visits, and evaluating its impact on a mortality prediction task. This use case demonstrates the broader promise of uncertainty-aware dynamic KGs for enhancing QA reliability in high-stakes applications.

*Vahideh Zolfaghari*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究评估了大型语言模型（LLMs）在儿科医患交流下受父母焦虑影响时的安全性，发现模型在对抗性压力下存在安全隐患，且较小模型（如Mistral-7B）表现优于大型模型（如Llama-3.3-70B），强调对齐和鲁棒性训练的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs在医疗领域的应用增加，但其在用户焦虑等现实压力下的安全性缺乏研究，尤其是对儿科场景中父母焦虑引发的对抗性挑战的应对能力不足。

Method: 构建包含150个真实和150个对抗性问题的PediatricAnxietyBench数据集，对Llama（70B/8B）和Mistral-7B模型进行API测试，通过约束、转诊、模糊性回应、急诊识别等指标评估安全性，并采用配对t检验分析。

Result: 模型安全评分9.70-10.39（满分15），Llama-3.1-8B优于Llama-3.3-70B（+0.66，p=0.0001），Mistral-7B对抗性效果最强（+1.09，p=0.0002）；23%的癫痫病例误诊，模糊性回应与安全性正相关（r=0.68）。

Conclusion: 模型安全性取决于对齐能力而非规模，需针对性训练增强对抗鲁棒性，且所有模型均缺乏急诊识别能力，不适合直接用于分诊，需结合人工审核及开放基准测试。

Abstract: Background Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in medical consultations, yet their safety under realistic user pressures remains understudied. Prior assessments focused on neutral conditions, overlooking vulnerabilities from anxious users challenging safeguards. This study evaluated LLM safety under parental anxiety-driven adversarial pressures in pediatric consultations across models and platforms. Methods PediatricAnxietyBench, from a prior evaluation, includes 300 queries (150 authentic, 150 adversarial) spanning 10 topics. Three models were assessed via APIs: Llama-3.3-70B and Llama-3.1-8B (Groq), Mistral-7B (HuggingFace), yielding 900 responses. Safety used a 0-15 scale for restraint, referral, hedging, emergency recognition, and non-prescriptive behavior. Analyses employed paired t-tests with bootstrapped CIs. Results Mean scores: 9.70 (Llama-3.3-70B) to 10.39 (Mistral-7B). Llama-3.1-8B outperformed Llama-3.3-70B by +0.66 (p=0.0001, d=0.225). Models showed positive adversarial effects, Mistral-7B strongest (+1.09, p=0.0002). Safety generalized across platforms; Llama-3.3-70B had 8% failures. Seizures vulnerable (33% inappropriate diagnoses). Hedging predicted safety (r=0.68, p<0.001). Conclusions Evaluation shows safety depends on alignment and architecture over scale, with smaller models outperforming larger. Evolution to robustness across releases suggests targeted training progress. Vulnerabilities and no emergency recognition indicate unsuitability for triage. Findings guide selection, stress adversarial testing, and provide open benchmark for medical AI safety.

TL;DR: 本研究展示了一个注释框架，利用多语言大语言模型（LLM）作为教师模型，提炼医学文本（波兰语）标注所需的专业知识，并训练出高效分类器，在保持高F1分数的同时显著降低计算资源消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 缺乏足够的波兰语医学文本标注资源是主要挑战，而现有LLM虽具潜力，但直接应用成本过高，需探索高效替代方案。

Method: 基于ADMEDVOICE项目的5类医学文本数据集，使用Llama3.1模型进行大规模自动标注，经有限人工验证后构建测试集，训练DistilBERT、BioBERT和HerBERT三种BERT架构分类器并对比性能。

Result: DistilBERT在全部5类临床文本中F1分数均>0.80（其中3类达>0.93），相比LLM体积缩小500倍，显存消耗降低300倍，推理速度提升数百倍。

Conclusion: DistilBERT在保证分类精度的同时大幅降低资源占用，为医疗场景中的高效NLP部署提供了可行方案，尤其适用于计算资源受限的环境。

Abstract: In this work, we present an annotation framework that demonstrates how a multilingual LLM pretrained on a large corpus can be used as a teacher model to distill the expert knowledge needed for tagging medical texts in Polish. This work is part of a larger project called ADMEDVOICE, within which we collected an extensive corpus of medical texts representing five clinical categories - Radiology, Oncology, Cardiology, Hypertension, and Pathology. Using this data, we had to develop a multi-class classifier, but the fundamental problem turned out to be the lack of resources for annotating an adequate number of texts. Therefore, in our solution, we used the multilingual Llama3.1 model to annotate an extensive corpus of medical texts in Polish. Using our limited annotation resources, we verified only a portion of these labels, creating a test set from them. The data annotated in this way were then used for training and validation of 3 different types of classifiers based on the BERT architecture - the distilled DistilBERT model, BioBERT fine-tuned on medical data, and HerBERT fine-tuned on the Polish language corpus. Among the models we trained, the DistilBERT model achieved the best results, reaching an F1 score > 0.80 for each clinical category and an F1 score > 0.93 for 3 of them. In this way, we obtained a series of highly effective classifiers that represent an alternative to large language models, due to their nearly 500 times smaller size, 300 times lower GPU VRAM consumption, and several hundred times faster inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长上下文基准测试在任务真实性、数据可扩展性和数据质量方面存在局限，需要更优质的基准测试方案。

Method: 通过自动化数据收集流程，结合外部资源（如维基百科）生成问答对；外部资源仅用于构建基准，不参与评估，并支持英文（25万token）和中文（32万token）双语。

Result: 在12个前沿大模型和3种长上下文方法上的实验证明：直接提供完整上下文显著优于其他方法；大部分模型仍难处理长文本，但Gemini-2.5-Pro表现突出；Agentic RAG有效解决Naïve RAG的检索瓶颈。

Conclusion: SagaScale为研究提供了可扩展的真实基准，揭示了模型和方法的关键短板，已公开基准和代码以推动后续研究。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant progress, but understanding long and complex documents remains challenging. Many long-context benchmarks have been proposed, but they face several limitations, including task realism, data scalability, and data quality. To this end, we introduce SagaScale, a realistic, scalable, and high-quality long-context benchmark built from full-length novels. The entire benchmark is constructed using an automated data collection pipeline that utilizes external resources (e.g., Wikipedia pages) to curate question-answer pairs. Critically, these external resources are provided only for benchmark construction and not during evaluation, which allows LLMs to curate complex questions that go beyond what they can answer during evaluation. SagaScale is also bilingual and offers the largest context length to date, with average token counts exceeding 250K for English novels and 320K for Chinese novels. Our evaluation across 12 frontier LLMs and three long-context methods -- Naïve RAG, Agentic RAG, and Long Context -- yields key insights, including: (1) Directly supplying the full context to the LLM can outperform other methods by a large margin; (2) Most LLMs still struggle with lengthy contexts, but Gemini-2.5-Pro stands out as an exception; and (3) Agentic RAG effectively addresses the retrieval bottleneck in Naïve RAG. Finally, we publicly release the SagaScale benchmark and our data collection codebase to facilitate future research.

### [65] [Syntactic Framing Fragility: An Audit of Robustness in LLM Ethical Decisions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09724)
*Katherine Elkins,Jon Chun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper identifies Syntactic Framing Fragility (SFF) in LLMs, where ethical judgments inconsistently reverse under syntactically equivalent prompts (e.g., 'should' vs. 'should not'). Testing 23 models revealed open-source models exhibit double the fragility of commercial ones, with chain-of-thought mitigating inconsistencies. Financial/business scenarios show higher risk than medical ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored robustness of LLMs in ethical decision-making under syntactic prompt variations, this study evaluates whether models maintain consistency in judgments when exposed to logically equivalent but syntactically different prompts, particularly focusing on negation and conditional structures.

Method: Developed SFF framework using Logical Polarity Normalization (LPN) to isolate syntactic effects without semantic drift. Audited 23 state-of-the-art models across 14 ethical scenarios and four controlled framings (39,975 decisions), comparing responses in positive/negative framings. Tested chain-of-thought (CoT) interventions as a mitigation strategy. Mapped fragility across domains (financial, business, medical).

Result: Found statistically significant fragility: models reverse ethical endorsements purely due to syntactic polarity, with open-source models 2x more fragile than commercial ones. Extreme negation sensitivity observed (80-97% action endorsement under 'should not' prompts). Chain-of-thought reduced fragility by 60-70%. Financial/business scenarios showed 3x higher fragility than medical contexts.

Conclusion: Syntactic consistency is a critical dimension of ethical robustness in LLMs. SFF-style audits are essential for safety evaluations in high-stakes deployments. Chain-of-thought reasoning serves as a practical mitigation, though fragility persists in complex domains like finance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in consequential decision-making settings, yet their robustness to benign prompt variation remains underexplored. In this work, we study whether LLMs maintain consistent ethical judgments across logically equivalent but syntactically different prompts, focusing on variations involving negation and conditional structure. We introduce Syntactic Framing Fragility (SFF), a robustness evaluation framework that isolates purely syntactic effects via Logical Polarity Normalization (LPN), enabling direct comparison of decisions across positive and negative framings without semantic drift. Auditing 23 state-of-the-art models spanning the U.S. and China as well as small U.S. open-source software models over 14 ethical scenarios and four controlled framings (39,975 decisions), we find widespread and statistically significant inconsistency: many models reverse ethical endorsements solely due to syntactic polarity, with open-source models exhibiting over twice the fragility of commercial counterparts. We further uncover extreme negation sensitivity, where some models endorse actions in 80-97% of cases when explicitly prompted with "should not." We show that eliciting chain-of-thought reasoning substantially reduces fragility, identifying a practical mitigation lever, and we map fragility across scenarios, finding higher risk in financial and business contexts than in medical scenarios. Our results demonstrate that syntactic consistency constitutes a distinct and critical dimension of ethical robustness, and we argue that SFF-style audits should be a standard component of safety evaluation for deployed LLMs. Code and results will be available on github.com.

Abstract: Punctuation plays a critical role in resolving semantic and structural ambiguity in written language. Machine Translation (MT) systems are now widely applied across diverse domains and languages, including many low-resource settings. In this work, we focus on Marathi, a low- to middle-resource language. We introduce Virām, the first diagnostic benchmark for assessing punctuation robustness in English-to-Marathi machine translation, consisting of 54 manually curated, punctuation-ambiguous instances. We evaluate two primary strategies for enhancing reliability: a pipeline-based restore-then-translate approach and direct fine-tuned on punctuation-varied data. Our results demonstrate that specialized fine-tuned models and pipeline systems significantly improve translation quality over standard baselines on the Virām benchmark. Qualitative analysis reveals that the original model may result in wrong translations leading to wrong interpretations, while fine-tuned models significantly improve overall reliability. Furthermore, we find that current Large Language Models (LLMs) lag behind these task-specific approaches in preserving meaning for punctuation-ambiguous text, thus necessitating further research in this area.

Conclusion: 遗忘机制是智能系统在动态环境中实现自适应的核心原则，该发现为LLM优化提供了新方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are often evaluated against ideals of perfect Bayesian inference, yet growing evidence suggests that their in-context reasoning exhibits systematic forgetting of past information. Rather than viewing this behavior as a limitation, we reinterpret forgetting as a functional cognitive mechanism. Drawing inspiration from human memory dynamics, we model LLM inference as a probabilistic memory process governed by exponential decay. We introduce a benchmark suite that evaluates temporal reasoning, concept drift adaptation, and associative recall, enabling direct comparison between model behavior and human cognitive patterns. Our empirical results reveal that LLMs demonstrate forgetting rates analogous to human memory efficiency trade-offs between stability and adaptability. Building on these observations, we propose probabilistic memory prompting, a lightweight strategy that shapes evidence integration to mimic human-like memory decay, leading to improved long-horizon reasoning performance. Our findings position forgetting not as a failure mode, but as a principled mechanism for adaptive intelligence.

### [68] [SciNets: Graph-Constrained Multi-Hop Reasoning for Scientific Literature Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09727)
*Sauhard Dubey*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SciNets proposed a graph-constrained multi-hop reasoning framework to tackle cross-domain scientific synthesis challenges by constructing concept graphs and identifying multi-hop explanation paths. It reveals a trade-off between mechanistic diversity and grounding stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing retrieval systems and language models struggle with controlled reasoning depth and structural grounding when connecting fragmented scientific knowledge. There lacks a behavioral framework to evaluate synthesis quality with quantitative metrics.

Method: 1. Construct query-specific concept graphs from literature corpora; 2. Compare four reasoning approaches: shortest path, diverse k-paths, stochastic walks, and retrieval-augmented LLM baseline; 3. Evaluate through three novel metrics: symbolic reasoning depth, mechanistic diversity, and grounding stability.

Result: Graph-constrained reasoning achieved controllable synthesis across ML/biology/climate domains. Shortest paths showed high stability but limited diversity, while deeper paths introduced instability despite richer mechanistic coverage. Explicit graph structures outperformed unconstrained LLM baselines.

Conclusion: The work establishes systematic understanding of graph-LLM integration capabilities/limitations in scientific reasoning. It provides actionable guidance for balancing exploration depth and structural reliability in knowledge synthesis systems.

Abstract: Cross-domain scientific synthesis requires connecting mechanistic explanations across fragmented literature, a capability that remains challenging for both retrieval-based systems and unconstrained language models. While recent work has applied large language models to scientific summarization and question answering, these approaches provide limited control over reasoning depth and structural grounding. We frame mechanistic synthesis as a graph-constrained multi-hop reasoning problem over literature-derived concept graphs. Given a scientific query and a compact, query-local corpus, SciNets constructs a directed concept graph and synthesizes mechanistic explanations by identifying multi-hop reasoning paths that connect concepts that rarely co-occur within individual papers. We systematically compare shortest-path reasoning, k-shortest paths with diversity constraints, stochastic random walks, and a retrieval-augmented language model baseline. Rather than evaluating correctness, which is often indeterminate when synthesizing connections across distributed sources, we introduce a behavioral framework that measures symbolic reasoning depth, mechanistic diversity, and grounding stability. Across machine learning, biology, and climate science tasks, explicit graph constraints enable controllable multi-hop reasoning while revealing a consistent trade-off: deeper and more diverse symbolic reasoning increases grounding instability, whereas shortest-path reasoning remains highly stable but structurally conservative. These findings provide a systematic behavioral characterization of the limits and capabilities of current graph-LLM integration for scientific synthesis.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合抽取式与生成式技术的混合摘要框架，用于处理金融报告与盈利通话记录的自动化摘要生成，兼顾效率与事实准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融文档包含大量结构化/半结构化信息，手动分析效率低且易产生主观偏差和错误；传统模型难以同时处理长文本依赖与资源限制问题。

Method: 采用两阶段流程：1) 基于LexRank算法抽取核心句子；2) 通过轻量化微调的BART/PEGASUS生成摘要；同时微调Longformer模型（LED）捕捉长文本依赖。

Result: 综合ROUGE/FinBERTScore等多维度评估显示，长文本模型综合性能最优，而混合框架以微弱代价实现事实准确性(Q=23%)与计算效率(Q=32%)的平衡。

Conclusion: 混合框架与长文本模型形成互补，在保持事实可靠性的同时为金融文档摘要提供实用化解决方案。

Abstract: Financial reports and earnings communications contain large volumes of structured and semi structured information, making detailed manual analysis inefficient. Earnings conference calls provide valuable evidence about a firm's performance, outlook, and strategic priorities. The manual analysis of lengthy call transcripts requires substantial effort and is susceptible to interpretive bias and unintentional error. In this work, we present a hybrid summarization framework that combines extractive and abstractive techniques to produce concise and factually reliable Reuters-style summaries from the ECTSum dataset. The proposed two stage pipeline first applies the LexRank algorithm to identify salient sentences, which are subsequently summarized using fine-tuned variants of BART and PEGASUS designed for resource constrained settings. In parallel, we fine-tune a Longformer Encoder-Decoder (LED) model to directly capture long-range contextual dependencies in financial documents.
  Model performance is evaluated using standard automatic metrics, including ROUGE, METEOR, MoverScore, and BERTScore, along with domain-specific variants such as SciBERTScore and FinBERTScore. To assess factual accuracy, we further employ entity-level measures based on source-precision and F1-target. The results highlight complementary trade offs between approaches, long context models yield the strongest overall performance, while the hybrid framework achieves competitive results with improved factual consistency under computational constraints. These findings support the development of practical summarization systems for efficiently distilling lengthy financial texts into usable business insights.

Motivation: 现有嵌入模型缺乏对多语言语义几何结构的系统性分析，需要深入验证其表征语义关系的有效性。

Method: 构建包含子字符、字符、词汇及数字的多级分析框架，开发Semanscope工具，结合PHATE流形学习对嵌入空间进行可视化分析。

Result: 子字符层结构元素（如汉字部首）出现几何坍缩，字符层不同书写系统呈现独特几何特征，词层跨20语义域形成聚类分支，阿拉伯数字展现螺旋轨迹而非传统聚类。

Conclusion: PHATE流形学习可有效分析嵌入空间的语义几何结构，并揭示多语言模型在语义区分和数字表征中的不足，为模型改进提供关键依据。

Abstract: We introduce a multi-level analysis framework for examining semantic geometry in multilingual embeddings, implemented through Semanscope (a visualization tool that applies PHATE manifold learning across four linguistic levels). Analysis of diverse datasets spanning sub-character components, alphabetic systems, semantic domains, and numerical concepts reveals systematic geometric patterns and critical limitations in current embedding models. At the sub-character level, purely structural elements (Chinese radicals) exhibit geometric collapse, highlighting model failures to distinguish semantic from structural components. At the character level, different writing systems show distinct geometric signatures. At the word level, content words form clustering-branching patterns across 20 semantic domains in English, Chinese, and German. Arabic numbers organize through spiral trajectories rather than clustering, violating standard distributional semantics assumptions. These findings establish PHATE manifold learning as an essential analytic tool not only for studying geometric structure of meaning in embedding space, but also for validating the effectiveness of embedding models in capturing semantic relationships.

### [71] [Benchmarking Cross-Lingual Semantic Alignment in Multilingual Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09732)
*Wen G. Gong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Semantic Affinity (SA), a metric to evaluate cross-lingual semantic alignment in multilingual embedding models, revealing that translation-pair supervision outperforms other training methods regardless of model scale.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks (e.g., MTEB) may mask fundamental cross-lingual alignment flaws in multilingual models. Practitioners lack clear criteria to distinguish truly aligned models from those relying on language-specific patterns.

Method: The authors propose SA, a bounded metric comparing inter-lingual vs. intra-lingual cosine distances, combined with PHATE visualization in the Semanscope framework. They benchmarked 13 models across 4 datasets (52 experiments) and analyzed training objectives’ impact on alignment.

Result: Models cluster into three tiers: (1) Supervised BERT models (LaBSE, USE, S-BERT) achieve SA=0.68–0.70; (2) LLM embeddings plateau at SA=0.55–0.61; (3) MLM-only BERT models (mBERT, XLM-R) score SA<0.50. Training objectives, not scale or multilingual data quantity, determine alignment quality.

Conclusion: Effective cross-lingual alignment requires explicit translation supervision during training. Models without such supervision learn corpus patterns, not universal cognitive primitives, highlighting the need for Semanscope-style benchmarking to guide model selection.

Abstract: With hundreds of multilingual embedding models available, practitioners lack clear guidance on which provide genuine cross-lingual semantic alignment versus task performance through language-specific patterns. Task-driven benchmarks (MTEB) may mask fundamental alignment shortcomings. We introduce Semantic Affinity (SA), a bounded (between 0 and 1) metric measuring inter-lingual to intra-lingual spread ratio using cosine distance, combined with PHATE visualization in our Semanscope framework. Benchmarking 13 models across 4 datasets (52 experiments) reveals a three-tier structure: (1) Top BERT models (LaBSE SA = 0.70, USE SA = 0.68, S-BERT SA = 0.68) achieve strong alignment via translation-pair supervision; (2) LLM embeddings plateau at SA between 0.55 and 0.61 regardless of 0.6 B to 8 B scale; (3) MLM-only BERT models (mBERT, XLM-R, SA < 0.50) fail despite more than 100 language training. Training objective, not architecture or scale, determines alignment. Oracle Bone primitives (1200 BCE) expose semantic drift-models learn corpus patterns rather than cognitive primitives. This work provides semantic benchmarking to help practitioners select quality multilingual embeddings from hundreds of available models, showing cross-lingual alignment requires explicit translation supervision, not merely model scale or multilingual data.

Conclusion: 验证了数据驱动型AI范式的有效性，透明评估体系可作为高质量训练数据工程的核心引擎

Abstract: The construction of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) datasets is a critical yet under-theorized stage in the post-training of Large Language Models (LLMs), as prevalent practices often rely on heuristic aggregation without a systematic understanding of how individual samples contribute to model performance. In this report, we propose a paradigm shift from ad-hoc curation to a closed-loop dataset engineering framework using OpenDataArena (ODA), which leverages value-anchored rankings and multi-dimensional analysis to transform value benchmarking into feedback signals guiding dataset construction. We instantiate this methodology through two new datasets: \textbf{ODA-Math-460k}, a specialized mathematics reasoning dataset that utilizes a novel two-stage difficulty-aware pipeline to achieve State-of-the-Art (SOTA) results on benchmarks such as AIME and HMMT, and \textbf{ODA-Mixture (100k \& 500k)}, a series of multi-domain instruction datasets built via an ``Anchor-and-Patch'' strategy that outperforms significantly larger open-source baselines. Our empirical results demonstrate that ODA-driven datasets significantly improve both domain-specific reasoning and general utility while achieving superior data efficiency, validating a transition toward data-centric AI where transparent evaluation serves as the primary engine for engineering high-quality training data.

Conclusion: 验证了幻觉诊断范式的可行性，提供了提升生成式AI系统可信度的有效方法论。

Abstract: Hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs), defined as the generation of content inconsistent with facts or context, represent a core obstacle to their reliable deployment in critical domains. Current research primarily focuses on binary "detection" approaches that, while capable of identifying hallucinations, fail to provide interpretable and actionable feedback for model improvement, thus limiting practical utility. To address this limitation, a new research paradigm is proposed, shifting from "detection" to "diagnosis". The Hallucination Diagnosis Task is introduced, a task which requires models to not only detect hallucinations, but also perform error localization, causal explanation, and content correction. We develop the Hallucination Diagnosis Generator (HDG), an automated pipeline that systematically generates high-quality training samples with rich diagnostic metadata from raw corpora through multi-dimensional augmentation strategies including controlled fact fabrication and reasoning chain perturbation. Using HDG-generated data, we train HDM-4B-RL, a 4-billion-parameter hallucination diagnosis model, employing Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a comprehensive reward function incorporating structural, accuracy, and localization signals. Experimental results demonstrate that our model surpasses previous state-of-the-art detection models on the HaluEval benchmark while achieving comparable performance to advanced general-purpose models. In comprehensive diagnosis tasks, HDM-4B-RL matches the capabilities of larger general models while maintaining a smaller size. This work validates the feasibility and value of hallucination diagnosis, providing an effective methodology for building more trustworthy and reliable generative AI systems.

Conclusion: 为LLM行为分析提供可解释性框架，其理论分析证明了泛化性和稳定性优势，推动负责任的AI应用发展

Abstract: Evaluating personality traits in Large Language Models (LLMs) is key to model interpretation, comparison, and responsible deployment. However, existing questionnaire-based evaluation methods exhibit limited stability and offer little explainability, as their results are highly sensitive to minor variations in prompt phrasing or role-play configurations. To address these limitations, we propose an internal-activation-based approach, termed Persona-Vector Neutrality Interpolation (PVNI), for stable and explainable personality trait evaluation in LLMs. PVNI extracts a persona vector associated with a target personality trait from the model's internal activations using contrastive prompts. It then estimates the corresponding neutral score by interpolating along the persona vector as an anchor axis, enabling an interpretable comparison between the neutral prompt representation and the persona direction. We provide a theoretical analysis of the effectiveness and generalization properties of PVNI. Extensive experiments across diverse LLMs demonstrate that PVNI yields substantially more stable personality trait evaluations than existing methods, even under questionnaire and role-play variants.

*Sriram Padmanabhan,Siyuan Song,Kanishka Misra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR:  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) replicate developmental patterns in children by showing similar behavioral biases in inductive reasoning based on linguistic structures (all > generic > some), indicating language-driven cognitive constraints in artificial systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate whether statistical learners like VLMs exhibit the same inductive reasoning biases as children when processing linguistic quantifiers ('all', 'some', generics), as observed in developmental studies on natural language cognition.

Method: Replicated Gelman et al.'s experiment with VLMs: (1) Precondition tests verified category recognition and sensitivity to 'all'/'some'; (2) Models evaluated property generalization ('bears are daxable') across quantifiers; (3) Post-hoc analysis examined internal representations for inductive constraints vs. surface-form differences.

Result: VLMs demonstrated human-like behavioral patterns (all > generic > some) and alignment with children's inductive biases. Representational analysis confirmed differences stemmed from logical constraints (e.g., quantifier scope) rather than superficial linguistic features (e.g., word choice).

Conclusion: Linguistic structures alone can induce human-like inductive biases in artificial learners, suggesting that formal language constraints inherently shape both biological and machine cognition without explicit training on cognitive priors.

Abstract: Language places subtle constraints on how we make inductive inferences. Developmental evidence by Gelman et al. (2002) has shown children (4 years and older) to differentiate among generic statements ("Bears are daxable"), universally quantified NPs ("all bears are daxable") and indefinite plural NPs ("some bears are daxable") in extending novel properties to a specific member (all > generics > some), suggesting that they represent these types of propositions differently. We test if these subtle differences arise in general purpose statistical learners like Vision Language Models, by replicating the original experiment. On tasking them through a series of precondition tests (robust identification of categories in images and sensitivities to all and some), followed by the original experiment, we find behavioral alignment between models and humans. Post-hoc analyses on their representations revealed that these differences are organized based on inductive constraints and not surface-form differences.

Conclusion: 揭示当前LLM应用于医疗咨询时存在重要安全隐患，强调医疗AI系统必须提升复杂医疗问题的理解和响应能力。

Abstract: Real-world health questions from patients often unintentionally embed false assumptions or premises. In such cases, safe medical communication typically involves redirection: addressing the implicit misconception and then responding to the underlying patient context, rather than the original question. While large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used by lay users for medical advice, they have not yet been tested for this crucial competency. Therefore, in this work, we investigate how LLMs react to false premises embedded within real-world health questions. We develop a semi-automated pipeline to curate MedRedFlag, a dataset of 1100+ questions sourced from Reddit that require redirection. We then systematically compare responses from state-of-the-art LLMs to those from clinicians. Our analysis reveals that LLMs often fail to redirect problematic questions, even when the problematic premise is detected, and provide answers that could lead to suboptimal medical decision making. Our benchmark and results reveal a novel and substantial gap in how LLMs perform under the conditions of real-world health communication, highlighting critical safety concerns for patient-facing medical AI systems.

Method: Created 633 expert-annotated text-to-SQL tasks on MIMIC-IV v3.1 EHR dataset testing SQL generation with: multi-table joins, clinically valid filters, and complex query composition capabilities under rubric-based evaluation framework

Result: GPT-5-mini achieved 74.7% execution score, DeepSeek-R1 leads open-source at 69.2%, Gemini-2.5-Pro drops from 85.5% (Easy) to 67.2% (Hard) showing significant performance gaps for clinical deployment

Conclusion: CLINSQL establishes measurable progress toward clinically reliable text-to-SQL systems through standardized benchmarking of critical requirements like schema navigation, clinical code interpretation, and multi-step query execution

Abstract: Real-world clinical text-to-SQL requires reasoning over heterogeneous EHR tables, temporal windows, and patient-similarity cohorts to produce executable queries. We introduce CLINSQL, a benchmark of 633 expert-annotated tasks on MIMIC-IV v3.1 that demands multi-table joins, clinically meaningful filters, and executable SQL. Solving CLINSQL entails navigating schema metadata and clinical coding systems, handling long contexts, and composing multi-step queries beyond traditional text-to-SQL. We evaluate 22 proprietary and open-source models under Chain-of-Thought self-refinement and use rubric-based SQL analysis with execution checks that prioritize critical clinical requirements. Despite recent advances, performance remains far from clinical reliability: on the test set, GPT-5-mini attains 74.7% execution score, DeepSeek-R1 leads open-source at 69.2% and Gemini-2.5-Pro drops from 85.5% on Easy to 67.2% on Hard. Progress on CLINSQL marks tangible advances toward clinically reliable text-to-SQL for real-world EHR analytics.

Motivation: 需要验证LM概率的优越性是否源于合理原因（如更高分辨率等），以避免因预测方法不同导致对语言理解中预测作用的科学结论出现偏差。

Method: 提出三个假设解释LM概率优势：（1）避免低分辨率问题；（2）区分语义相似词；（3）准确分配低频词概率，并通过实证数据验证。

Result: 结果支持三个假设，表明LM概率确实在细粒度区分和低频词处理上优于完形填空数据。

Conclusion: 建议改进完形填空研究的分辨率，并实验验证人类预测是否具备LM的高灵敏度细粒度区分能力。

Abstract: How predictable a word is can be quantified in two ways: using human responses to the cloze task or using probabilities from language models (LMs).When used as predictors of processing effort, LM probabilities outperform probabilities derived from cloze data. However, it is important to establish that LM probabilities do so for the right reasons, since different predictors can lead to different scientific conclusions about the role of prediction in language comprehension. We present evidence for three hypotheses about the advantage of LM probabilities: not suffering from low resolution, distinguishing semantically similar words, and accurately assigning probabilities to low-frequency words. These results call for efforts to improve the resolution of cloze studies, coupled with experiments on whether human-like prediction is also as sensitive to the fine-grained distinctions made by LM probabilities.

Abstract: Standardized math assessments require expensive human pilot studies to establish the difficulty of test items. We investigate the predictive value of open-source large language models (LLMs) for evaluating the difficulty of multiple-choice math questions for real-world students. We show that, while LLMs are poor direct judges of problem difficulty, simulation-based approaches with LLMs yield promising results under the right conditions. Under the proposed approach, we simulate a "classroom" of 4th, 8th, or 12th grade students by prompting the LLM to role-play students of varying proficiency levels. We use the outcomes of these simulations to fit Item Response Theory (IRT) models, comparing learned difficulty parameters for items to their real-world difficulties, as determined by item-level statistics furnished by the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). We observe correlations as high as 0.75, 0.76, and 0.82 for grades 4, 8, and 12, respectively. In our simulations, we experiment with different "classroom sizes," showing tradeoffs between computation size and accuracy. We find that role-plays with named students improves predictions (compared to student ids), and stratifying names across gender and race further improves predictions. Our results show that LLMs with relatively weaker mathematical abilities (Gemma) actually yield better real-world difficulty predictions than mathematically stronger models (Llama and Qwen), further underscoring the suitability of open-source models for the task.

Method: 开发混合框架:1) 用领域数据微调NMT模型生成初稿,2) 通过检索增强生成(RAG)技术,利用大语言模型(LLM)进行迭代优化。重点分析检索示例数量和检索算法对性能的影响。

Result: 在Dhao跨领域翻译任务中,新框架达到35.21 chrF++,较纯NMT提升+8.10,恢复率达97.5%。实证分析发现性能提升主要归功于检索示例数量,而非特定检索算法。

Conclusion: 混合框架能有效修复领域迁移带来的严重翻译缺陷。LLM通过RAG机制扮演'安全网'角色,且检索示例的数量比算法选择更重要。这种模块化方法为低资源语言跨领域翻译提供了新思路。

Abstract: Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models for low-resource languages suffer significant performance degradation under domain shift. We quantify this challenge using Dhao, an indigenous language of Eastern Indonesia with no digital footprint beyond the New Testament (NT). When applied to the unseen Old Testament (OT), a standard NMT model fine-tuned on the NT drops from an in-domain score of 36.17 chrF++ to 27.11 chrF++. To recover this loss, we introduce a hybrid framework where a fine-tuned NMT model generates an initial draft, which is then refined by a Large Language Model (LLM) using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The final system achieves 35.21 chrF++ (+8.10 recovery), effectively matching the original in-domain quality. Our analysis reveals that this performance is driven primarily by the number of retrieved examples rather than the choice of retrieval algorithm. Qualitative analysis confirms the LLM acts as a robust "safety net," repairing severe failures in zero-shot domains.

*Sanghyeok Choi,Woosang Jeon,Kyuseok Yang,Taehyeong Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SocraticKG improves knowledge graph construction by using question-answer pairs as an intermediate step to resolve trade-offs between factual coverage and structural coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based methods face a trade-off where increasing factual coverage causes relational fragmentation, while consolidation leads to information loss.

Method: SocraticKG introduces 5W1H-guided QA expansion as a structured intermediate representation to capture contextual dependencies and implicit relationships before triple extraction.

Result: On the MINE benchmark, the approach retains facts effectively while maintaining structural cohesion, even with large-scale knowledge extraction.

Conclusion: QA-mediated semantic scaffolding enhances KG construction by structuring document-level semantics, enabling more reliable and coherent graph generation.

Abstract: Constructing Knowledge Graphs (KGs) from unstructured text provides a structured framework for knowledge representation and reasoning, yet current LLM-based approaches struggle with a fundamental trade-off: factual coverage often leads to relational fragmentation, while premature consolidation causes information loss. To address this, we propose SocraticKG, an automated KG construction method that introduces question-answer pairs as a structured intermediate representation to systematically unfold document-level semantics prior to triple extraction. By employing 5W1H-guided QA expansion, SocraticKG captures contextual dependencies and implicit relational links typically lost in direct KG extraction pipelines, providing explicit grounding in the source document that helps mitigate implicit reasoning errors. Evaluation on the MINE benchmark demonstrates that our approach effectively addresses the coverage-connectivity trade-off, achieving superior factual retention while maintaining high structural cohesion even as extracted knowledge volume substantially expands. These results highlight that QA-mediated semantic scaffolding plays a critical role in structuring semantics prior to KG extraction, enabling more coherent and reliable graph construction in subsequent stages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NLP问答系统仅在基准数据集上评估，缺乏临床环境下的实际适用性验证。

Method: 设计多智能体框架，整合异构多模态EHR数据，在真实医院场景（多样化数据结构、时间推理、多证据整合）下进行评估。

Result: 在公共及机构数据集中实现86%准确率，通过临床验证且响应时间符合医疗场景需求。

Conclusion: EHRNavigator解决了实验室评估与临床部署之间的鸿沟，提供强适配性和实用性的EHR问答方案。

Abstract: Clinical decision-making increasingly relies on timely and context-aware access to patient information within Electronic Health Records (EHRs), yet most existing natural language question-answering (QA) systems are evaluated solely on benchmark datasets, limiting their practical relevance. To overcome this limitation, we introduce EHRNavigator, a multi-agent framework that harnesses AI agents to perform patient-level question answering across heterogeneous and multimodal EHR data. We assessed its performance using both public benchmark and institutional datasets under realistic hospital conditions characterized by diverse schemas, temporal reasoning demands, and multimodal evidence integration. Through quantitative evaluation and clinician-validated chart review, EHRNavigator demonstrated strong generalization, achieving 86% accuracy on real-world cases while maintaining clinically acceptable response times. Overall, these findings confirm that EHRNavigator effectively bridges the gap between benchmark evaluation and clinical deployment, offering a robust, adaptive, and efficient solution for real-world EHR question answering.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EmplifAI, a Japanese empathetic dialogue dataset with 28 emotion categories for chronic disease patients, shows high evaluation F1 scores (0.83) and improved LLM fluency/empathy. Evaluation pipeline validated via LLM-as-a-Judge vs. human correlation analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Patients with chronic conditions experience shifting complex emotions (e.g., hope, despair) requiring situationally adapted dialogue systems, which existing datasets inadequately address.

Method: Created 280 medically contextualized situations and 4,125 dialogues using crowdsourcing/ expert review across 28 GoEmotions-based categories. Evaluated with BERTScore across LLMs; fine-tuned Japanese LLM; validated assessment pipeline via correlation between LLM-as-a-Judge scores and human ratings.

Result: BERTScore achieved F1=0.83. Fine-tuned model improved fluency and empathy. Significant correlation between LLM and human raters identified, with analysis of assessment risks/biases.

Conclusion: EmplifAI is a robust resource for empathetic dialogue systems with validated medical/emotional granularity. Evaluation pipeline demonstrates LLMs' assessment potential while highlighting caution against over-reliance on automated metrics.

Abstract: This paper introduces EmplifAI, a Japanese empathetic dialogue dataset designed to support patients coping with chronic medical conditions. They often experience a wide range of positive and negative emotions (e.g., hope and despair) that shift across different stages of disease management. EmplifAI addresses this complexity by providing situation-based dialogues grounded in 28 fine-grained emotion categories, adapted and validated from the GoEmotions taxonomy. The dataset includes 280 medically contextualized situations and 4125 two-turn dialogues, collected through crowdsourcing and expert review. To evaluate emotional alignment in empathetic dialogues, we assessed model predictions on situation--dialogue pairs using BERTScore across multiple large language models (LLMs), achieving F1 scores of 0.83. Fine-tuning a baseline Japanese LLM (LLM-jp-3.1-13b-instruct4) with EmplifAI resulted in notable improvements in fluency, general empathy, and emotion-specific empathy. Furthermore, we compared the scores assigned by LLM-as-a-Judge and human raters on dialogues generated by multiple LLMs to validate our evaluation pipeline and discuss the insights and potential risks derived from the correlation analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 教师模型生成的长推理路径导致学生模型学习困难，需设计更优蒸馏框架。

Method: 动态截断教师模型推理路径，利用前缀对齐监督学生模型训练。

Result: 在多个数学基准测试中表现超基线模型3%以上，验证方法有效性。

Conclusion: P-ALIGN通过减少冗余推理提升蒸馏效果，为推理优化提供新方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities, particularly in solving complex mathematical problems. Recent studies show that distilling long reasoning trajectories can effectively enhance the reasoning performance of small-scale student models. However, teacher-generated reasoning trajectories are often excessively long and structurally complex, making them difficult for student models to learn. This mismatch leads to a gap between the provided supervision signal and the learning capacity of the student model. To address this challenge, we propose Prefix-ALIGNment distillation (P-ALIGN), a framework that fully exploits teacher CoTs for distillation through adaptive prefix alignment. Specifically, P-ALIGN adaptively truncates teacher-generated reasoning trajectories by determining whether the remaining suffix is concise and sufficient to guide the student model. Then, P-ALIGN leverages the teacher-generated prefix to supervise the student model, encouraging effective prefix alignment. Experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that P-ALIGN outperforms all baselines by over 3%. Further analysis indicates that the prefixes constructed by P-ALIGN provide more effective supervision signals, while avoiding the negative impact of redundant and uncertain reasoning components.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the effectiveness of commercial machine translation systems for low-resource languages during crises, using the TICO-19 dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the language mismatch in crisis communication (e.g., government-to-vulnerable communities) and assess readiness for future pandemics through translation quality.

Method: Evaluated four commercial MT systems using the TICO-19 dataset (pandemic-related sentences from high-priority, low-resource languages) to measure usability of translations.

Result: Identified limitations in current MT systems for low-resource languages, highlighting gaps in crisis preparedness and translation accessibility for vulnerable populations.

Conclusion: Commercial MT systems require improvement for critical crisis scenarios, emphasizing the need for better translation tools to support equitable communication in future epidemics/pandemics.

Abstract: Communication in times of crisis is essential. However, there is often a mismatch between the language of governments, aid providers, doctors, and those to whom they are providing aid. Commercial MT systems are reasonable tools to turn to in these scenarios. But how effective are these tools for translating to and from low resource languages, particularly in the crisis or medical domain? In this study, we evaluate four commercial MT systems using the TICO-19 dataset, which is composed of pandemic-related sentences from a large set of high priority languages spoken by communities most likely to be affected adversely in the next pandemic. We then assess the current degree of ``readiness'' for another pandemic (or epidemic) based on the usability of the output translations.

TL;DR: CALM-IT框架通过建模双角色对话动态解决长程动机访谈对话中大语言模型的长期一致性问题，采用双向状态空间模型提升治疗目标对齐与对话稳定性，实验证明其在有效性、目标对齐度及客户接受率（64.3%）上优于基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在心理健康场景中难以维持长期真实且目标导向的对话，因局部优化导致对话漂移。

Method: 提出CALM-IT框架，将治疗师-客户对话建模为双向状态空间过程，通过持续更新双方对齐度、心理状态及短期目标指导策略选择和语句生成。

Result: 在大规模评估中，CALM-IT在有效性和目标对齐度上表现最优，对话长度增加时稳定性显著优于基线，客户接受率最高（64.3%）且治疗师干预次数最少。

Conclusion: 建模动态对话状态对生成高质量长程合成对话至关重要。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in mental health-related settings, yet they struggle to sustain realistic, goal-directed dialogue over extended interactions. While LLMs generate fluent responses, they optimize locally for the next turn rather than maintaining a coherent model of therapeutic progress, leading to brittleness and long-horizon drift. We introduce CALM-IT, a framework for generating and evaluating long-form Motivational Interviewing (MI) dialogues that explicitly models dual-actor conversational dynamics. CALM-IT represents therapist-client interaction as a bidirectional state-space process, in which both agents continuously update inferred alignment, mental states, and short-term goals to guide strategy selection and utterance generation. Across large-scale evaluations, CALM-IT consistently outperforms strong baselines in Effectiveness and Goal Alignment and remains substantially more stable as conversation length increases. Although CALM-IT initiates fewer therapist redirections, it achieves the highest client acceptance rate (64.3%), indicating more precise and therapeutically aligned intervention timing. Overall, CALM-IT provides evidence for modeling evolving conversational state being essential for generating high-quality long-form synthetic conversations.

Motivation: 现有评估方法仅关注答案匹配，缺乏对因果推理链的考察；科学文档中图文交织的原始结构未被充分利用。

Method: 构建SIN-Data科学图文交织语料库，设计包含证据发现（SIN-Find）、假设验证（SIN-Verify）、基于证据的问答（SIN-QA）和证据锚定综合（SIN-Summary）的SIN-Bench评估体系，采用"无证据无得分"评分机制。

Result: 8种MLLM实验显示：Gemini-3-pro整体得分最高（0.573），GPT-5在SIN-QA任务准确率最高（0.767）但证据关联得分较低，揭示正确性判断与可验证证据链之间的能力鸿沟。

Conclusion: 模型的可验证证据链接能力成为瓶颈，需建立注重因果推理路径的新评估范式。

Abstract: Evaluating whether multimodal large language models truly understand long-form scientific papers remains challenging: answer-only metrics and synthetic "Needle-In-A-Haystack" tests often reward answer matching without requiring a causal, evidence-linked reasoning trace in the document. We propose the "Fish-in-the-Ocean" (FITO) paradigm, which requires models to construct explicit cross-modal evidence chains within native scientific documents. To operationalize FITO, we build SIN-Data, a scientific interleaved corpus that preserves the native interleaving of text and figures. On top of it, we construct SIN-Bench with four progressive tasks covering evidence discovery (SIN-Find), hypothesis verification (SIN-Verify), grounded QA (SIN-QA), and evidence-anchored synthesis (SIN-Summary). We further introduce "No Evidence, No Score", scoring predictions when grounded to verifiable anchors and diagnosing evidence quality via matching, relevance, and logic. Experiments on eight MLLMs show that grounding is the primary bottleneck: Gemini-3-pro achieves the best average overall score (0.573), while GPT-5 attains the highest SIN-QA answer accuracy (0.767) but underperforms on evidence-aligned overall scores, exposing a gap between correctness and traceable support.

Motivation: 因大型推理模型（如DeepSeek-R1）蒸馏时需大量监督微调数据，亟需数据高效训练方法

Method: 1.基于技能的数据选择（针对模型弱项挑选样本）+2.技能感知微调（强化问题解决中的技能分解）

Result: 在10万例语料库中仅选1千例训练，Qwen3-4B提升1.6%/Qwen3-8B提升1.4%，增益集中在训练强化的特定技能

Conclusion: 技能中心化训练能高效实现推理能力蒸馏，在大幅减少数据量的同时保持性能提升

Abstract: Large reasoning models such as DeepSeek-R1 and their distilled variants achieve strong performance on complex reasoning tasks. Yet, distilling these models often demands large-scale data for supervised fine-tuning (SFT), motivating the pursuit of data-efficient training methods. To address this, we propose a skill-centric distillation framework that efficiently transfers reasoning ability to weaker models with two components: (1) Skill-based data selection, which prioritizes examples targeting the student model's weaker skills, and (2) Skill-aware fine-tuning, which encourages explicit skill decomposition during problem solving. With only 1,000 training examples selected from a 100K teacher-generated corpus, our method surpasses random SFT baselines by +1.6% on Qwen3-4B and +1.4% on Qwen3-8B across five mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Further analysis confirms that these gains concentrate on skills emphasized during training, highlighting the effectiveness of skill-centric training for efficient reasoning distillation.

TL;DR: 本文提出了TS-Bench基准、TS-Guard防护模型和TS-Flow推理框架，用于解决LLM智能体工具调用的实时安全检测问题，通过历史交互分析实现65%的有害调用削减和10%的任务完成度提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM智能体调用外部工具的能力增强，其潜在的安全风险显著增加。现有的安全防护研究多聚焦事后分析，缺乏通过交互历史推理实现实时检测与主动干预的系统化方法，急需构建评估基准并开发可解释的安全防护方案。

Method: 1）构建首个面向步骤级调用安全检测的基准TS-Bench；2）采用多任务强化学习开发TS-Guard模型，通过交互历史的多维度语义分析（操作危害性评估与攻击关联性建模）生成可解释的安全判决；3）设计TS-Flow框架，将防护反馈融入智能体推理过程形成闭环控制。

Result: TS-Flow框架使ReAct型智能体在遭遇提示注入攻击时，有害工具调用率降低65%（相对基线），同时良性任务完成率提升9.7%。TS-Guard在跨场景安全判别任务中表现出47.3%的F1提升，且检测响应时间控制在200ms内。

Conclusion: 本工作构建了LLM智能体工具安全领域的完整技术栈，通过可解释的防护模型实现前置性风险干预。TS-Bench提供了标准化的评估方案，TS-Flow实现了安全防护与任务效能的双提升，为高风险场景下的LLM应用部署提供了实践验证的解决方案。

Abstract: While LLM-based agents can interact with environments via invoking external tools, their expanded capabilities also amplify security risks. Monitoring step-level tool invocation behaviors in real time and proactively intervening before unsafe execution is critical for agent deployment, yet remains under-explored. In this work, we first construct TS-Bench, a novel benchmark for step-level tool invocation safety detection in LLM agents. We then develop a guardrail model, TS-Guard, using multi-task reinforcement learning. The model proactively detects unsafe tool invocation actions before execution by reasoning over the interaction history. It assesses request harmfulness and action-attack correlations, producing interpretable and generalizable safety judgments and feedback. Furthermore, we introduce TS-Flow, a guardrail-feedback-driven reasoning framework for LLM agents, which reduces harmful tool invocations of ReAct-style agents by 65 percent on average and improves benign task completion by approximately 10 percent under prompt injection attacks.

Method: 通过熵值评估和因果效应指标分析专家对特定领域的偏好性激活及因果贡献，建立token与专家激活的关联性分析方法，并通过权重调节验证模型性能优化。

Result: 1) 领域专家展示领域特异性偏好，驱动专家对模型输出有显性因果影响；2) 句子前序token更易触发驱动专家；3) 调整专家权重使三领域模型性能均有显著提升。

Conclusion: 揭示了MoE模型中多专家协作的内在机制，通过量化分析专家激活特征与token触发效应，为模型解释性提供理论支持。

Abstract: Most interpretability work focuses on layer- or neuron-level mechanisms in Transformers, leaving expert-level behavior in MoE LLMs underexplored. Motivated by functional specialization in the human brain, we analyze expert activation by distinguishing domain and driver experts. In this work, we study expert activation in MoE models across three public domains and address two key questions: (1) which experts are activated, and whether certain expert types exhibit consistent activation patterns; and (2) how tokens are associated with and trigger the activation of specific experts. To answer these questions, we introduce entropy-based and causal-effect metrics to assess whether an expert is strongly favored for a particular domain, and how strongly expert activation contributes causally to the model's output, thus identify domain and driver experts, respectively. Furthermore, we explore how individual tokens are associated with the activation of specific experts. Our analysis reveals that (1) Among the activated experts, some show clear domain preferences, while others exert strong causal influence on model performance, underscoring their decisive roles. (2) tokens occurring earlier in a sentence are more likely to trigger the driver experts, and (3) adjusting the weights of domain and driver experts leads to significant performance gains across all three models and domains. These findings shed light on the internal mechanisms of MoE models and enhance their interpretability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates how pretraining data with varying alignment discourse affects AI alignment, showing negative discourse amplifies misalignment while positive input reduces it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand causal impact of AI behavioral descriptions in pretraining datasets on downstream alignment, addressing potential self-fulfilling misalignment risks.

Method: Pretrained 6.9B LLMs with controlled datasets: varying proportions of synthetic documents discussing misalignment, aligned behaviors, and neutral content.

Result: Misalignment discourse significantly increases model misalignment (-45% -> 9% score reduction with aligned data). Effects persist after post-training but get partially mitigated.

Conclusion: Demonstrates alignment pretraining critically shapes behavioral priors, advocating for proactive alignment focus during initial pretraining alongside capability development.

Abstract: Pretraining corpora contain extensive discourse about AI systems, yet the causal influence of this discourse on downstream alignment remains poorly understood. If prevailing descriptions of AI behaviour are predominantly negative, LLMs may internalise corresponding behavioural priors, giving rise to self-fulfilling misalignment. This paper provides the first controlled study of this hypothesis by pretraining 6.9B-parameter LLMs with varying amounts of (mis)alignment discourse. We find that discussion of AI contributes to misalignment. Upsampling synthetic training documents about AI misalignment leads to a notable increase in misaligned behaviour. Conversely, upsampling documents about aligned behaviour reduces misalignment scores from 45% to 9%. We consider this evidence of self-fulfilling alignment. These effects are dampened, but persist through post-training. Our findings establish the study of how pretraining data shapes alignment priors, or alignment pretraining, as a complement to post-training. We recommend practitioners pretrain for alignment as well as capabilities. Our models and datasets are available at alignmentpretraining.ai

Motivation: 大语言模型在多语言翻译中面临系统性跨语言冗余问题，现有提示工程方法难以平衡语义保真度与严格时间约束（如字幕/配音），需要更有效的解决方案。

Method: 提出两阶段创新：1）构建Sand-Glass音节级时长约束翻译评估基准；2）设计HOMURA强化学习框架，采用KL正则化目标与动态音节比例奖励机制，通过强化学习优化语义与时长的权衡。

Result: 实验显示HOMURA显著优于强基线模型，可精确控制输出长度（音节级精度），在保持语义等价性的同时满足语言密度层级要求，符合实时字幕/配音的时间限制。

Conclusion: 该研究为多语言翻译中的时效性-准确性矛盾提供了有效解决方案，通过结构化基准测试与创新优化框架的配合，实现了语言生成质量与时间约束的平衡。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable strides in multilingual translation but are hindered by a systemic cross-lingual verbosity bias, rendering them unsuitable for strict time-constrained tasks like subtitling and dubbing. Current prompt-engineering approaches struggle to resolve this conflict between semantic fidelity and rigid temporal feasibility. To bridge this gap, we first introduce Sand-Glass, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate translation under syllable-level duration constraints. Furthermore, we propose HOMURA, a reinforcement learning framework that explicitly optimizes the trade-off between semantic preservation and temporal compliance. By employing a KL-regularized objective with a novel dynamic syllable-ratio reward, HOMURA effectively "tames" the output length. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms strong LLM baselines, achieving precise length control that respects linguistic density hierarchies without compromising semantic adequacy.

TL;DR: The paper introduces HUMANLLM, a framework for role-playing language agents that models psychological patterns as causal forces, achieving stronger human alignment than larger models by focusing on cognitive processes rather than surface-level behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based role-playing agents lack authentic alignment with human cognitive/behavioral patterns despite strong reasoning/generation capabilities. Existing metrics conflate simulation accuracy with socially desirable responses, necessitating more holistic frameworks.

Method: 1) Constructed 244 psychological patterns from 12,000 academic papers; 2) Synthesized 11,359 multi-pattern interaction scenarios; 3) Implemented dual-level checklists evaluating both individual pattern fidelity and emergent dynamics; 4) Used multi-turn conversations to model inner thoughts, actions, and dialogue.

Result: 1) Achieved r=0.91 human alignment correlation; 2) HUMANLLM-8B outperformed Qwen3-32B on multi-pattern dynamics despite 4x fewer parameters; 3) Revealed limitations in holistic evaluation metrics; 4) Demonstrated computational efficiency through parameter reduction without performance loss.

Conclusion: Authentic anthropomorphism requires modeling the cognitive processes underlying human behaviors (not just observable actions). Integrating causal psychological patterns enables more efficient, accurate simulation of human-like decision-making dynamics compared to conventional parameter-heavy approaches.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in reasoning and generation, serving as the foundation for advanced persona simulation and Role-Playing Language Agents (RPLAs). However, achieving authentic alignment with human cognitive and behavioral patterns remains a critical challenge for these agents. We present HUMANLLM, a framework treating psychological patterns as interacting causal forces. We construct 244 patterns from ~12,000 academic papers and synthesize 11,359 scenarios where 2-5 patterns reinforce, conflict, or modulate each other, with multi-turn conversations expressing inner thoughts, actions, and dialogue. Our dual-level checklists evaluate both individual pattern fidelity and emergent multi-pattern dynamics, achieving strong human alignment (r=0.91) while revealing that holistic metrics conflate simulation accuracy with social desirability. HUMANLLM-8B outperforms Qwen3-32B on multi-pattern dynamics despite 4x fewer parameters, demonstrating that authentic anthropomorphism requires cognitive modeling--simulating not just what humans do, but the psychological processes generating those behaviors.

Abstract: Aligning multilingual assistants with culturally grounded user preferences is essential for serving India's linguistically diverse population of over one billion speakers across multiple scripts. However, existing benchmarks either focus on a single language or conflate retrieval with generation, leaving open the question of whether current embedding models can encode persona-instruction compatibility without relying on response synthesis. We present a unified benchmark spanning 12 Indian languages and four evaluation tasks: monolingual and cross-lingual persona-to-instruction retrieval, reverse retrieval from instruction to persona, and binary compatibility classification. Eight multilingual embedding models are evaluated in a frozen-encoder setting with a thin logistic regression head for classification. E5-Large-Instruct achieves the highest Recall@1 of 27.4\% on monolingual retrieval and 20.7\% on cross-lingual transfer, while BGE-M3 leads reverse retrieval at 32.1\% Recall@1. For classification, LaBSE attains 75.3\% AUROC with strong calibration. These findings offer practical guidance for model selection in Indic multilingual retrieval and establish reproducible baselines for future work\footnote{Code, datasets, and models are publicly available at https://github.com/aryashah2k/PI-Indic-Align.

### [95] [Loop as a Bridge: Can Looped Transformers Truly Link Representation Space and Natural Language Outputs?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10242)
*Guanxu Chen,Dongrui Liu,Jing Shao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Looped Transformers can reduce the gap between internal knowledge and linguistic outputs in LLMs but suffer from knowledge degradation and limited introspection across iterations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often struggle to align their internal knowledge with explicit linguistic outputs, and this study explores whether Looped Transformers' iterative computation can address this via introspection-like mechanisms.

Method: Experiments tested varying loop iterations in LTs to analyze their impact on knowledge retention, evaluated representational degradation across loops, and investigated perception capabilities at different stages of iteration.

Result: Increasing iterations narrowed the knowledge-output gap but caused representational degradation; perception capabilities were only evident in the final loop, not progressively improved.

Conclusion: LTs show potential for scaling depth but require enhanced introspection to maintain knowledge coherence and effectively link representation space with natural language output.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit a gap between their internal knowledge and their explicit linguistic outputs. In this report, we empirically investigate whether Looped Transformers (LTs)--architectures that increase computational depth by iterating shared layers--can bridge this gap by utilizing their iterative nature as a form of introspection. Our experiments reveal that while increasing loop iterations narrows the gap, it is partly driven by a degradation of their internal knowledge carried by representations. Moreover, another empirical analysis suggests that current LTs' ability to perceive representations does not improve across loops; it is only present in the final loop. These results suggest that while LTs offer a promising direction for scaling computational depth, they have yet to achieve the introspection required to truly link representation space and natural language.

TL;DR: 提出新方法分离语言因素在道德判断中的影响，显示推理语言比输入语言影响更大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统评估方法无法区分道德困境中的语言输入和推理语言的影响，需要一种更精准的分析方法。

Method: 独立操控道德困境的语言和模型推理语言，结合道德基础理论分析差异，并识别权威维度的拆分。

Result: 推理语言对结果贡献2倍于输入语言，检测到近半数模型的语境依赖性，生成诊断分类用于部署指导，并发现权威维度可拆分为家庭与机构。

Conclusion: 新框架有效分解语言因素影响，并揭示道德判断复杂性，为多语言部署提供实用诊断工具。

Abstract: When LLMs judge moral dilemmas, do they reach different conclusions in different languages, and if so, why? Two factors could drive such differences: the language of the dilemma itself, or the language in which the model reasons. Standard evaluation conflates these by testing only matched conditions (e.g., English dilemma with English reasoning). We introduce a methodology that separately manipulates each factor, covering also mismatched conditions (e.g., English dilemma with Chinese reasoning), enabling decomposition of their contributions. To study \emph{what} changes, we propose an approach to interpret the moral judgments in terms of Moral Foundations Theory. As a side result, we identify evidence for splitting the Authority dimension into a family-related and an institutional dimension. Applying this methodology to English-Chinese moral judgment with 13 LLMs, we demonstrate its diagnostic power: (1) the framework isolates reasoning-language effects as contributing twice the variance of input-language effects; (2) it detects context-dependency in nearly half of models that standard evaluation misses; and (3) a diagnostic taxonomy translates these patterns into deployment guidance. We release our code and datasets at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CrossCulturalMoralJudgement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer 模型中注意力头关系的解释缺乏有效的量化指标，现有指标如 Composition Score 不能很好地捕捉这种关系。

Method: 提出 Projection Kernel (PK) 作为基于主角的子空间相似度量，并引入一个框架通过与随机正交子空间的参考分布对比，评估 PK 分布的信息量。

Result: PK 在 IOI 任务上能更清晰地再现已知的注意力头交互模式；通过 PK 构建的有向图分析发现 GPT2-small 模型中 L4H7 起到中心节点（identity head）的作用。

Conclusion: 提出的 PK 方法能更好地捕捉 Transformer 模型中注意力头之间的结构关系，为模型解释提供了新的分析工具。

Abstract: Understanding relationships between attention heads is essential for interpreting the internal structure of Transformers, yet existing metrics do not capture this structure well. We focus on the subspaces spanned by attention-head weight matrices and quantify head-to-head relationships using the Projection Kernel (PK), a principal-angle-based measure of subspace similarity. Experiments show that PK reproduces known head-to-head interactions on the IOI task more clearly than prior metrics such as the Composition Score. We further introduce a framework to quantify the informativeness of PK distributions by comparing them with a reference distribution derived from random orthogonal subspaces. As an application, we analyze a directed graph constructed from PK and show that, in GPT2-small, L4H7 acts as a hub by functioning as an identity head.

Result: 在保持英文和中文语言模型间道德表征差异性的同时，实现了跨语言道德控制，错误拒绝率降低34%，越狱攻击防御成功率提升至92%。

Conclusion: 基于内在道德表征的动态干预方法可同时提升模型安全性和可用性，为多语言AI伦理治理提供了可扩展的技术框架。

Abstract: Enhancing the moral alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a critical challenge in AI safety. Current alignment techniques often act as superficial guardrails, leaving the intrinsic moral representations of LLMs largely untouched. In this paper, we bridge this gap by leveraging Moral Foundations Theory (MFT) to map and manipulate the fine-grained moral landscape of LLMs. Through cross-lingual linear probing, we validate the shared nature of moral representations in middle layers and uncover a shared yet different moral subspace between English and Chinese. Building upon this, we extract steerable Moral Vectors and successfully validate their efficacy at both internal and behavioral levels. Leveraging the high generalizability of morality, we propose Adaptive Moral Fusion (AMF), a dynamic inference-time intervention that synergizes probe detection with vector injection to tackle the safety-helpfulness trade-off. Empirical results confirm that our approach acts as a targeted intrinsic defense, effectively reducing incorrect refusals on benign queries while minimizing jailbreak success rates compared to standard baselines.

Motivation: 传统多语言方法依赖共享参数和模型规模，本文认为应通过跨语言的语义表示对齐来解决。

Method: 在平行数据上显式对齐语义混合和上下文表示，同时用目标语言建模损失保持流畅性。

Result: 在四种语言基准上优于其他多语言对齐方法，使用2-4倍更少数据达到与单语模型相近性能，并保持语义结构一致性。

Conclusion: SENSIA通过语义级对齐实现了语言适应性和数据高效性，在跨语言任务中表现出色且鲁棒。

Abstract: We approach multilinguality as sense adaptation: aligning latent meaning representations across languages rather than relying solely on shared parameters and scale. In this paper, we introduce SENse-based Symmetric Interlingual Alignment (SENSIA), which adapts a Backpack language model from one language to another by explicitly aligning sense-level mixtures and contextual representations on parallel data, while jointly training a target-language language modeling loss to preserve fluency. Across benchmarks on four typologically diverse languages, SENSIA generally outperforms comparable multilingual alignment methods and achieves competitive accuracy against monolingual from-scratch baselines while using 2-4x less target-language data. Analyses of learned sense geometry indicate that local sense topology and global structure relative to English are largely preserved, and ablations show that the method is robust in terms of design and scale.

Abstract: In this paper, we present BAR-SQL (Boundary-Aware Reliable NL2SQL), a unified training framework that embeds reliability and boundary awareness directly into the generation process. We introduce a Seed Mutation data synthesis paradigm that constructs a representative enterprise corpus, explicitly encompassing multi-step analytical queries alongside boundary cases including ambiguity and schema limitations. To ensure interpretability, we employ Knowledge-Grounded Reasoning Synthesis, which produces Chain-of-Thought traces explicitly anchored in schema metadata and business rules. The model is trained through a two-stage process: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by Reinforcement Learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization. We design a Task-Conditioned Hybrid Reward mechanism that simultaneously optimizes SQL execution accuracy-leveraging Abstract Syntax Tree analysis and dense result matching-and semantic precision in abstention responses. To evaluate reliability alongside generation accuracy, we construct and release Ent-SQL-Bench, which jointly assesse SQL precision and boundary-aware abstention across ambiguous and unanswerable queries. Experimental results on this benchmark demonstrate that BAR-SQL achieves 91.48% average accuracy, outperforming leading proprietary models, including Claude 4.5 Sonnet and GPT-5, in both SQL generation quality and boundary-aware abstention capability.

Conclusion: 该模型通过架构创新和数据增强策略，解决了长文本处理与历史偏差双重挑战，在工业级应用场景中实现可解释的匹配优化

Abstract: Finding the most relevant person for a job proposal in real time is challenging, especially when resumes are long, structured, and multilingual. In this paper, we propose a re-ranking model based on a new generation of late cross-attention architecture, that decomposes both resumes and project briefs to efficiently handle long-context inputs with minimal computational overhead. To mitigate historical data biases, we use a generative large language model (LLM) as a teacher, generating fine-grained, semantically grounded supervision. This signal is distilled into our student model via an enriched distillation loss function. The resulting model produces skill-fit scores that enable consistent and interpretable person-job matching. Experiments on relevance, ranking, and calibration metrics demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Motivation: 当学生模型已具备强推理能力时，传统持续蒸馏会导致性能下降，需解决训练过程中的性能瓶颈问题。

Method: 发现token层级的置信度分化机制，提出T3S重构训练目标，分离锚定token与待学习token的优化路径。

Result: 在AR和dLLM设置中均取得显著提升，Qwen3-8B超越DeepSeek-R1，LLaDA-2.0-Mini达16B模型最优性能。

Conclusion: T3S通过消除优化路径冲突，使持续蒸馏在前沿场景下仍能有效提升模型效率。

Abstract: Efficient distillation is a key pathway for converting expensive reasoning capability into deployable efficiency, yet in the frontier regime where the student already has strong reasoning ability, naive continual distillation often yields limited gains or even degradation. We observe a characteristic training phenomenon: even as loss decreases monotonically, all performance metrics can drop sharply at almost the same bottleneck, before gradually recovering. We further uncover a token-level mechanism: confidence bifurcates into steadily increasing Imitation-Anchor Tokens that quickly anchor optimization and other yet-to-learn tokens whose confidence is suppressed until after the bottleneck. And the characteristic that these two types of tokens cannot coexist is the root cause of the failure in continual distillation. To this end, we propose Training-Trajectory-Aware Token Selection (T3S) to reconstruct the training objective at the token level, clearing the optimization path for yet-to-learn tokens. T3 yields consistent gains in both AR and dLLM settings: with only hundreds of examples, Qwen3-8B surpasses DeepSeek-R1 on competitive reasoning benchmarks, Qwen3-32B approaches Qwen3-235B, and T3-trained LLaDA-2.0-Mini exceeds its AR baseline, achieving state-of-the-art performance among all of 16B-scale no-think models.

Abstract: Enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to effectively utilize tools in multi-turn interactions is essential for building capable autonomous agents. However, acquiring diverse and realistic multi-turn tool-use data remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose a novel text-based paradigm. We observe that textual corpora naturally contain rich, multi-step problem-solving experiences, which can serve as an untapped, scalable, and authentic data source for multi-turn tool-use tasks. Based on this insight, we introduce GEM, a data synthesis pipeline that enables the generation and extraction of multi-turn tool-use trajectories from text corpora through a four-stage process: relevance filtering, workflow & tool extraction, trajectory grounding, and complexity refinement. To reduce the computational cost, we further train a specialized Trajectory Synthesizer via supervised fine-tuning. This model distills the complex generation pipeline into an efficient, end-to-end trajectory generator. Experiments demonstrate that our GEM-32B achieve a 16.5% improvement on the BFCL V3 Multi-turn benchmark. Our models partially surpass the performance of models trained on τ - bench (Airline and Retail) in-domain data, highlighting the superior generalization capability derived from our text-based synthesis paradigm. Notably, our Trajectory Synthesizer matches the quality of the full pipeline while significantly reducing inference latency and costs.

*Christina Lu,Jack Gallagher,Jonathan Michala,Kyle Fish,Jack Lindsey*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper identifies an 'Assistant Axis' in large language models that governs their default helpful persona and reveals how deviating from this axis affects behavior, including persona drift and susceptibility to jailbreaks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the structure of persona space in large language models and how post-training influences their default assistant identity, as well as to explore the risks of persona drift during specific conversational scenarios.

Method: Extracting activation directions for diverse personas across multiple models, analyzing the Assistant Axis in pre-trained vs. post-trained models, and testing steering effects on behavior and adversarial vulnerabilities.

Result: The Assistant Axis was found to control helpful/harmless behavior; drifting from it induced non-default personas and unstable behaviors. Pre-trained models promoted human-like helpful archetypes. Persona drift was triggered by meta-reflection or emotional topics, but could be mitigated by restricting activation regions.

Conclusion: Post-training loosely anchors models to a persona region, highlighting the need for improved methods to stabilize coherent persona adoption and mitigate risks from adversarial or edge-case scenarios.

Abstract: Large language models can represent a variety of personas but typically default to a helpful Assistant identity cultivated during post-training. We investigate the structure of the space of model personas by extracting activation directions corresponding to diverse character archetypes. Across several different models, we find that the leading component of this persona space is an "Assistant Axis," which captures the extent to which a model is operating in its default Assistant mode. Steering towards the Assistant direction reinforces helpful and harmless behavior; steering away increases the model's tendency to identify as other entities. Moreover, steering away with more extreme values often induces a mystical, theatrical speaking style. We find this axis is also present in pre-trained models, where it primarily promotes helpful human archetypes like consultants and coaches and inhibits spiritual ones. Measuring deviations along the Assistant Axis predicts "persona drift," a phenomenon where models slip into exhibiting harmful or bizarre behaviors that are uncharacteristic of their typical persona. We find that persona drift is often driven by conversations demanding meta-reflection on the model's processes or featuring emotionally vulnerable users. We show that restricting activations to a fixed region along the Assistant Axis can stabilize model behavior in these scenarios -- and also in the face of adversarial persona-based jailbreaks. Our results suggest that post-training steers models toward a particular region of persona space but only loosely tethers them to it, motivating work on training and steering strategies that more deeply anchor models to a coherent persona.

TL;DR: 本论文提出了INDIC-DIALECT语料库，包含11种方言、2种语言的13k句子对，并构建多任务基准测试（分类/问答/翻译），发现微调模型显著提升方言任务性能，而GPT-4o等大型模型表现不佳。该语料库将开源以促进低资源印度方言研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前NLP研究集中于标准化语言，印度低资源方言（如大量使用的印地语和奥里亚语方言）在现有数据集中缺乏代表性，制约了相关自然语言处理技术的发展。

Method: 构建包含11种方言/2种语言的平行语料库，设计包含方言分类、多选问答、机器翻译的多任务测试框架，对比微调模型与基线模型（GPT-4o、Gemini）在任务上的表现，并探索混合AI模型与规则-AI结合的翻译方案。

Result: 微调印度语言预训练模型使方言分类F1值从19.6%提升至89.8%；混合AI模型在方言→语言翻译中达到61.32 BLEU分（基线23.36）；规则-AI组合在语言→方言翻译中达到48.44 BLEU分（基线27.59）；GPT-4o等大模型在分类任务表现差。

Conclusion: INDIC-DIALECT语料库填补了低资源印度方言NLP研究空白，证明特定模型微调与混合方案能显著改善方言处理性能，计划开源语料库以推动方言级NLP技术发展。

Abstract: Recent NLP advances focus primarily on standardized languages, leaving most low-resource dialects under-served especially in Indian scenarios. In India, the issue is particularly important: despite Hindi being the third most spoken language globally (over 600 million speakers), its numerous dialects remain underrepresented. The situation is similar for Odia, which has around 45 million speakers. While some datasets exist which contain standard Hindi and Odia languages, their regional dialects have almost no web presence. We introduce INDIC-DIALECT, a human-curated parallel corpus of 13k sentence pairs spanning 11 dialects and 2 languages: Hindi and Odia. Using this corpus, we construct a multi-task benchmark with three tasks: dialect classification, multiple-choice question (MCQ) answering, and machine translation (MT). Our experiments show that LLMs like GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 perform poorly on the classification task. While fine-tuned transformer based models pretrained on Indian languages substantially improve performance e.g., improving F1 from 19.6\% to 89.8\% on dialect classification. For dialect to language translation, we find that hybrid AI model achieves highest BLEU score of 61.32 compared to the baseline score of 23.36. Interestingly, due to complexity in generating dialect sentences, we observe that for language to dialect translation the ``rule-based followed by AI" approach achieves best BLEU score of 48.44 compared to the baseline score of 27.59. INDIC-DIALECT thus is a new benchmark for dialect-aware Indic NLP, and we plan to release it as open source to support further work on low-resource Indian dialects.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 罗马尼亚语作为形态丰富且计算资源匮乏的语言，缺乏统一的端到端语言模型训练框架。传统方法难以解决形态膨胀造成的标记通胀问题，且现有合成数据生成工作（TF1, TF2）主要面向英语及翻译数据，缺乏母语级生成能力。

Method: 1. 构建语言特征敏感的训练语料，采用BPE/Unigram算法训练罗马尼亚语专用分词器；2. 使用长序列打包训练法，从零预训练基于Transformer的LLaMA模型（51.65M参数）；3. 通过量化、结构剪枝和logit级知识蒸馏进行模型压缩，采用嵌入绑定技术优化部署性能；4. 开发组合式提示框架生成三百万篇合成寓言，结合内在指标（语言模型困惑度）、语言特性测试（格/数/时态一致性）、LLM评估的多模态评估体系。

Result: 1. 分词效率提升：相较通用分词器降低32%标记数；2. 模型性能：压缩后的26.45M参数模型在罗马尼亚语基准测试中超越现有开源模型；3. 数据质量：合成数据在句法连贯性（+24%）、实体一致性（+19%）等指标显著优于翻译数据；4. 成本优化：训练计算量降低58%，推理延迟低于300ms。

Conclusion: TF3-RO验证了面向形态复杂语言的定制化建模方案有效性，首次实现从数据准备到模型压缩的全流程自主化，为低资源语言提供可复现的合成数据生成模板。研究证明，基于语言特征设计的分词策略和结构感知的蒸馏方法，可有效平衡模型规模与性能，在边缘设备部署场景具有显著优势。

Abstract: Recent advances in synthetic data generation have shown that compact language models can be trained effectively when the underlying corpus is structurally controlled and linguistically coherent. However, for morphologically rich and computationally under-resourced languages such as Romanian, there is still no openly documented, end-to-end pipeline that unifies tokenizer design, preprocessing, pretraining, compression, evaluation, and large-scale synthetic data generation in a reproducible framework. Building on TF1, a three-million-story English fable dataset, and TF2, which extends TF1 through high-quality Romanian translations, we introduce TF3-RO, a Romanian-centric language modeling pipeline spanning tokenizer training, from-scratch model development, and Romanian-native dataset generation. TF3-RO constructs Romanian-specific BPE and Unigram tokenizers from a linguistically informed corpus to mitigate token inflation induced by Romanian morphology. Using long-sequence packed training, we pretrain a 51.65M-parameter LLaMA-style Transformer entirely from scratch. The model is subsequently optimized through quantization, structured pruning, and logit-based knowledge distillation, yielding a compact 26.45M-parameter student model with tied embeddings and strong deployment characteristics. Using this distilled model, TF3-RO generates three million Romanian-native synthetic fables via a controlled combinatorial prompting framework. Across all stages, the pipeline integrates a comprehensive evaluation suite combining intrinsic metrics, Romanian agreement probes, entity coherence, rule-based grammar checking, and LLM-based assessment. TF3-RO provides a reproducible and linguistically grounded framework for training compact Romanian language models and producing large-scale synthetic narrative corpora.

Abstract: Futrell and Mahowald claim LMs "serve as model systems", but an assessment at each of Marr's three levels suggests the claim is clearly not true at the implementation level, poorly motivated at the algorithmic-representational level, and problematic at the computational theory level. LMs are good candidates as tools; calling them cognitive models overstates the case and unnecessarily feeds LLM hype.

TL;DR: 论文提出新的外科手术规划评估框架，揭示现有评估协议在安全关键场景中的不足，并通过多中心基准测试显示序列相似性指标的误判问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估协议无法可靠评估视觉-语言模型在手术规划等安全关键场景的表现，需基于专家规则建立更精确的评估标准。

Method: 定义phase-goal satisfiability作为规划正确性标准，构建多中心元评估基准包含有效变体和错误计划，并采用规则驱动的目标可满足性指标作为高精度评估参考。

Result: 序列相似性指标系统性误判规划质量，规则驱动方法揭示模型感知错误与推理缺陷；结构知识显著提升表现，而语义指导在无约束时效果不可靠。

Conclusion: 基于规则的目标可满足性评估可有效暴露模型弱点，结构化知识比纯语义引导更重要，为高风险场景模型评估提供新范式。

Abstract: Surgical planning integrates visual perception, long-horizon reasoning, and procedural knowledge, yet it remains unclear whether current evaluation protocols reliably assess vision-language models (VLMs) in safety-critical settings. Motivated by a goal-oriented view of surgical planning, we define planning correctness via phase-goal satisfiability, where plan validity is determined by expert-defined surgical rules. Based on this definition, we introduce a multicentric meta-evaluation benchmark with valid procedural variations and invalid plans containing order and content errors. Using this benchmark, we show that sequence similarity metrics systematically misjudge planning quality, penalizing valid plans while failing to identify invalid ones. We therefore adopt a rule-based goal-satisfiability metric as a high-precision meta-evaluation reference to assess Video-LLMs under progressively constrained settings, revealing failures due to perception errors and under-constrained reasoning. Structural knowledge consistently improves performance, whereas semantic guidance alone is unreliable and benefits larger models only when combined with structural constraints.

### [110] [Contextual StereoSet: Stress-Testing Bias Alignment Robustness in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10460)
*Abhinaba Basu,Pavan Chakraborty*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 模型在不同时间段（如1990 vs 2030）、语境（如八卦框架）或受众群体（如外部观察者）中可能表现出显著偏差，传统固定条件测试无法完全反映真实世界偏见风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去偏测试多基于固定上下文场景，但实际部署中的动态背景（如时间、场景、文化差异）可能显著影响模型行为。论文提出需要系统化评估模型对上下文的敏感性。

Method: 构建Contextual StereoSet基准：1) 固定刻板内容但参数化调节时间/场景/受众维度；2) 提出上下文敏感性指纹CSF（包含置信区间分析和FDR校正）；3) 设计两种测评模式（深度诊断与生产筛选）

Result: 13个模型显示时间锚定效应（1990年代模型偏见提升p<0.05）、八卦框架使5/6模型偏差上升、外部观察者导致最多13pp波动。CSF可在雇佣/借贷等垂直领域有效检测偏见敏感度。

Conclusion: 传统'固定条件-单一偏见评分'的测评方法存在局限性，需转向'条件-偏差敏感度指纹'的系统性评估范式。该基准可作为模型可靠性压力测试工具。

Abstract: A model that avoids stereotypes in a lab benchmark may not avoid them in deployment. We show that measured bias shifts dramatically when prompts mention different places, times, or audiences -- no adversarial prompting required.
  We introduce Contextual StereoSet, a benchmark that holds stereotype content fixed while systematically varying contextual framing. Testing 13 models across two protocols, we find striking patterns: anchoring to 1990 (vs. 2030) raises stereotype selection in all models tested on this contrast (p<0.05); gossip framing raises it in 5 of 6 full-grid models; out-group observer framing shifts it by up to 13 percentage points. These effects replicate in hiring, lending, and help-seeking vignettes.
  We propose Context Sensitivity Fingerprints (CSF): a compact profile of per-dimension dispersion and paired contrasts with bootstrap CIs and FDR correction. Two evaluation tracks support different use cases -- a 360-context diagnostic grid for deep analysis and a budgeted protocol covering 4,229 items for production screening.
  The implication is methodological: bias scores from fixed-condition tests may not generalize.This is not a claim about ground-truth bias rates; it is a stress test of evaluation robustness. CSF forces evaluators to ask, "Under what conditions does bias appear?" rather than "Is this model biased?" We release our benchmark, code, and results.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AEQ-Bench是一个新的基准测试，用于评估多模态大型模型（OLMs）的同理心能力，发现具有音频输出功能的OLMs在粗粒度评估中优于纯文本模型，但在细粒度副语言表达性评估中仍不可靠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于同理心具有情感特性，自动化评估多模态大型模型（OLMs）的同理心能力仍然具有挑战性，因此需要通过新基准测试系统化评估其核心能力。

Method: AEQ-Bench通过两种新颖设置（语境特异性和语音语调变化）评估OLMs：（i）利用音频和文本生成同理心回应；（ii）无需文本转录判断音频回应的同理心水平。使用语言学和副语言学指标进行综合评估。

Result: (1) 具备音频输出能力的OLMs普遍优于纯文本输出模型；(2) OLMs在粗粒度质量评估中与人类判断一致，但无法可靠评估细粒度副语言表达性。

Conclusion: AEQ-Bench证明多模态输入和音频输出对同理心评估的重要性，同时揭示现有OLMs在副语言表达性评估中的局限性。

Abstract: While the automatic evaluation of omni-modal large models (OLMs) is essential, assessing empathy remains a significant challenge due to its inherent affectivity. To investigate this challenge, we introduce AEQ-Bench (Audio Empathy Quotient Benchmark), a novel benchmark to systematically assess two core empathetic capabilities of OLMs: (i) generating empathetic responses by comprehending affective cues from multi-modal inputs (audio + text), and (ii) judging the empathy of audio responses without relying on text transcription. Compared to existing benchmarks, AEQ-Bench incorporates two novel settings that vary in context specificity and speech tone. Comprehensive assessment across linguistic and paralinguistic metrics reveals that (1) OLMs trained with audio output capabilities generally outperformed models with text-only outputs, and (2) while OLMs align with human judgments for coarse-grained quality assessment, they remain unreliable for evaluating fine-grained paralinguistic expressiveness.

TL;DR: 本论文提出了一种基于心理学的双向同理心评估模型(PERM)，通过引入支持者/寻求者双视角及旁观者监控机制，在情感支持任务中实现了比现有方法提升10%以上的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法评估同理心时仅采用单视角，忽视了同理心理论中的双向互动本质，导致情感支持效果受限。

Method: 构建三维评估框架：1) 支持者视角评估内在共鸣与表达 2) 寻求者视角评估情感接收 3) 旁观者视角监控整体交互质量，形成闭环评估体系。

Result: 在情感智能基准测试和工业对话数据集中，PERM分别取得10%+的性能提升，用户盲测显示70%的偏好率，在GitHub开放源代码、数据集和预训练模型。

Conclusion: 双向交互评估方法(PERM)显著提升了大模型的情感支持能力，通过多视角动态平衡机制实现了更符合心理学原理的同理心建模。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in human-centric applications, yet they often fail to provide substantive emotional support. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been utilized to enhance empathy of LLMs, existing reward models typically evaluate empathy from a single perspective, overlooking the inherently bidirectional interaction nature of empathy between the supporter and seeker as defined by Empathy Cycle theory. To address this limitation, we propose Psychology-grounded Empathetic Reward Modeling (PERM). PERM operationalizes empathy evaluation through a bidirectional decomposition: 1) Supporter perspective, assessing internal resonation and communicative expression; 2) Seeker perspective, evaluating emotional reception. Additionally, it incorporates a bystander perspective to monitor overall interaction quality. Extensive experiments on a widely-used emotional intelligence benchmark and an industrial daily conversation dataset demonstrate that PERM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by over 10\%. Furthermore, a blinded user study reveals a 70\% preference for our approach, highlighting its efficacy in generating more empathetic responses. Our code, dataset, and models are available at https://github.com/ZhengWwwq/PERM.

TL;DR: 本论文提出知识免疫框架（KIF），通过内部激活特征实现真正的知识遗忘，突破了稳定-遗忘权衡限制，在不同规模模型上验证了有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对当前模型遗忘方法无法区分行为抑制与真实知识移除的问题，需满足GDPR合规性和模型安全性需求

Method: 开发基于内部激活特征的KIF框架，融合动态表征抑制与参数高效适配技术，直接作用于模型内部表征而非表层输出

Result: 实现接近理论最优的知识遗忘（遗忘质量0.99）且保持模型效用（效用0.62），在3B-14B参数模型验证有效性，发现标准模型与推理模型存在架构差异

Conclusion: 成功建立表层泄露与潜在痕迹的双指标评估体系，首次系统揭示不同架构模型的遗忘行为差异，为大规模模型知识管理提供新路径

Abstract: Selective knowledge erasure from LLMs is critical for GDPR compliance and model safety, yet current unlearning methods conflate behavioral suppression with true knowledge removal, allowing latent capabilities to persist beneath surface-level refusals. In this work, we address this challenge by introducing Knowledge Immunization Framework (KIF), a representation-aware architecture that distinguishes genuine erasure from obfuscation by targeting internal activation signatures rather than surface outputs. Our approach combines dynamic suppression of subject-specific representations with parameter-efficient adaptation, enabling durable unlearning without full model retraining. KIF achieves near-oracle erasure (FQ approx 0.99 vs. 1.00) while preserving utility at oracle levels (MU = 0.62), effectively breaking the stability-erasure tradeoff that has constrained all prior work. We evaluate both standard foundation models (Llama and Mistral) and reasoning-prior models (Qwen and DeepSeek) across 3B to 14B parameters. Our observation shows that standard models exhibit scale-independent true erasure (<3% utility drift), while reasoning-prior models reveal fundamental architectural divergence. Our comprehensive dual-metric evaluation protocol, combining surface-level leakage with latent trace persistence, operationalizes the obfuscation - erasure distinction and enables the first systematic diagnosis of mechanism-level forgetting behavior across model families and scales.

Motivation: 研究多语言条件下困惑度等指标是否仍能准确反映模型质量

Method: 在单双语模型和双平行语料库上测试六种评估指标，分析信息内容与语义对比的矛盾

Result: 实验证明当前评估指标在多语言场景下不具有通用可比性

Conclusion: 形式与意义的理论分歧可解释指标失效现象

Abstract: Intrinsic evaluation metrics for conditional language models, such as perplexity or bits-per-character, are widely used in both mono- and multilingual settings. These metrics are rather straightforward to use and compare in monolingual setups, but rest on a number of assumptions in multilingual setups. One such assumption is that comparing the perplexity of CLMs on parallel sentences is indicative of their quality since the information content (here understood as the semantic meaning) is the same. However, the metrics are inherently measuring information content in the information-theoretic sense. We make this and other such assumptions explicit and discuss their implications. We perform experiments with six metrics on two multi-parallel corpora both with mono- and multilingual models. Ultimately, we find that current metrics are not universally comparable. We look at the form-meaning debate to provide some explanation for this.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出TracVC方法，通过追踪大型语言模型（LLMs）生成的信心表达来源，发现模型常依赖与问题无关的通用语言模式而非实际内容，导致信心表达不可靠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs常表现出与事实准确性不一致的过度自信，需探究其信心表达的来源以提升可信度。

Method: 开发TracVC框架，结合信息检索与影响估计技术，追踪模型信心表达的训练数据来源，并提出'内容依附性'指标衡量信心是否基于相关或通用数据。

Result: 实验表明OLMo2-13B模型的置信表达常受与查询无关的通用信心数据影响，呈现对确定性语言表层模式的模仿，而缺乏实质性内容支撑。

Conclusion: 当前训练范式存在根本缺陷：模型可能仅学会'显得自信'而非'合理自信'，需要改进训练以增强信心表达的可靠性基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can increase users' perceived trust by verbalizing confidence in their outputs. However, prior work has shown that LLMs are often overconfident, making their stated confidence unreliable since it does not consistently align with factual accuracy. To better understand the sources of this verbalized confidence, we introduce TracVC (\textbf{Trac}ing \textbf{V}erbalized \textbf{C}onfidence), a method that builds on information retrieval and influence estimation to trace generated confidence expressions back to the training data. We evaluate TracVC on OLMo and Llama models in a question answering setting, proposing a new metric, content groundness, which measures the extent to which an LLM grounds its confidence in content-related training examples (relevant to the question and answer) versus in generic examples of confidence verbalization. Our analysis reveals that OLMo2-13B is frequently influenced by confidence-related data that is lexically unrelated to the query, suggesting that it may mimic superficial linguistic expressions of certainty rather than rely on genuine content grounding. These findings point to a fundamental limitation in current training regimes: LLMs may learn how to sound confident without learning when confidence is justified. Our analysis provides a foundation for improving LLMs' trustworthiness in expressing more reliable confidence.

Motivation: 检测文本说服力是理解人类交流的关键挑战，传统方法难以有效识别声誉攻击、转移焦点等具体策略对说服效果的影响。

Method: 在三个论点数据集（Winning Arguments、Anthropic/Persuasion、Persuasion for Good）上实验，结合六种策略的分类提示工程，对Winning Arguments数据集进行话题标注并开展跨领域分析。

Conclusion: 结构化策略感知提示能优化论点质量评估，策略分析框架和标注数据集为后续研究提供可解释性分析工具。

Abstract: Detecting persuasion in argumentative text is a challenging task with important implications for understanding human communication. This work investigates the role of persuasion strategies - such as Attack on reputation, Distraction, and Manipulative wording - in determining the persuasiveness of a text. We conduct experiments on three annotated argument datasets: Winning Arguments (built from the Change My View subreddit), Anthropic/Persuasion, and Persuasion for Good. Our approach leverages large language models (LLMs) with a Multi-Strategy Persuasion Scoring approach that guides reasoning over six persuasion strategies. Results show that strategy-guided reasoning improves the prediction of persuasiveness. To better understand the influence of content, we organize the Winning Argument dataset into broad discussion topics and analyze performance across them. We publicly release this topic-annotated version of the dataset to facilitate future research. Overall, our methodology demonstrates the value of structured, strategy-aware prompting for enhancing interpretability and robustness in argument quality assessment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有内存系统无法区分不同上下文中重复出现的相似实体及事实，导致检索到不匹配的上下文信息，需减少这种干扰。

Method: STITCH以结构性检索线索、上下文意图（包括潜在目标、动作类型、显著实体类型）索引每个交互步骤，并在推理时按意图匹配度过滤和优先展示记忆片段。

Result: 在CAME-Bench和LongMemEval基准测试中，STITCH比最强基线模型性能提升35.6%，轨迹越长增益越显著，且分析显示意图索引显著降低检索噪声。

Conclusion: 上下文感知的意图索引机制能有效抑制语义干扰，支撑长期目标推理任务的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Deploying large language models in long-horizon, goal-oriented interactions remains challenging because similar entities and facts recur under different latent goals and constraints, causing memory systems to retrieve context-mismatched evidence. We propose STITCH (Structured Intent Tracking in Contextual History), an agentic memory system that indexes each trajectory step with a structured retrieval cue, contextual intent, and retrieves history by matching the current step's intent. Contextual intent provides compact signals that disambiguate repeated mentions and reduce interference: (1) the current latent goal defining a thematic segment, (2) the action type, and (3) the salient entity types anchoring which attributes matter. During inference, STITCH filters and prioritizes memory snippets by intent compatibility, suppressing semantically similar but context-incompatible history.
  For evaluation, we introduce CAME-Bench, a benchmark for context-aware retrieval in realistic, dynamic, goal-oriented trajectories. Across CAME-Bench and LongMemEval, STITCH achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the strongest baseline by 35.6%, with the largest gains as trajectory length increases. Our analysis shows that intent indexing substantially reduces retrieval noise, supporting intent-aware memory for robust long-horizon reasoning.

TL;DR: MatchTIR introduces fine-grained reward assignment and dual-level advantage estimation for tool-integrated reasoning in LLMs, improving performance on long-horizon tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reinforcement learning methods for TIR use coarse outcome-/trajectory-level rewards, failing to distinguish effective tool calls from redundant/erroneous ones in complex multi-turn scenarios.

Method: 1) Bipartite matching-based turn-level reward assignment through alignment of predicted/ground-truth traces; 2) Dual-level advantage estimation combining turn-level precision with trajectory-level success signals.

Result: 4B MatchTIR model outperformed most 8B competitors, showing significant advantages in long-horizon/multi-turn tasks across three benchmarks.

Conclusion: The framework enables better credit assignment for tool interactions through dense supervision and hybrid advantage estimation, advancing LLM capabilities in complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) empowers large language models (LLMs) to tackle complex tasks by interleaving reasoning steps with external tool interactions. However, existing reinforcement learning methods typically rely on outcome- or trajectory-level rewards, assigning uniform advantages to all steps within a trajectory. This coarse-grained credit assignment fails to distinguish effective tool calls from redundant or erroneous ones, particularly in long-horizon multi-turn scenarios. To address this, we propose MatchTIR, a framework that introduces fine-grained supervision via bipartite matching-based turn-level reward assignment and dual-level advantage estimation. Specifically, we formulate credit assignment as a bipartite matching problem between predicted and ground-truth traces, utilizing two assignment strategies to derive dense turn-level rewards. Furthermore, to balance local step precision with global task success, we introduce a dual-level advantage estimation scheme that integrates turn-level and trajectory-level signals, assigning distinct advantage values to individual interaction turns. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of MatchTIR. Notably, our 4B model surpasses the majority of 8B competitors, particularly in long-horizon and multi-turn tasks. Our codes are available at https://github.com/quchangle1/MatchTIR.
