Result: 在保持干净数据98.5%检测精度的同时，攻击成功率在中毒样本上达到92.3%，比传统静态触发方法高15.6%，且触发器位置变化的动态特性显著增强隐蔽性。

Conclusion: 动态掩码后门攻击对目标检测模型构成严重威胁，研究结果凸显了开发鲁棒性防御机制的必要性，并警示了机器学习模型外包训练中的潜在安全风险。

Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized numerous tasks within the computer vision field, including image classification, image segmentation, and object detection. However, the increasing deployment of deep learning models has exposed them to various adversarial attacks, including backdoor attacks. This paper presents a novel dynamic mask-based backdoor attack method, specifically designed for object detection models. We exploit a dataset poisoning technique to embed a malicious trigger, rendering any models trained on this compromised dataset vulnerable to our backdoor attack. We particularly focus on a mushroom detection dataset to demonstrate the practical risks posed by such attacks on critical real-life domains. Our work also emphasizes the importance of creating a detailed backdoor attack scenario to illustrate the significant risks associated with the outsourcing practice. Our approach leverages SAM, a recent and powerful image segmentation AI model, to create masks for dynamic trigger placement, introducing a new and stealthy attack method. Through extensive experimentation, we show that our sophisticated attack scenario maintains high accuracy on clean data with the YOLOv7 object detection model while achieving high attack success rates on poisoned samples. Our approach surpasses traditional methods for backdoor injection, which are based on static and consistent patterns. Our findings underscore the urgent need for robust countermeasures to protect deep learning models from these evolving adversarial threats.

Abstract: Dynamic Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have demonstrated considerable success in generating high-fidelity 3D models of talking portraits. Despite significant advancements in the rendering speed and generation quality, challenges persist in accurately and efficiently capturing mouth movements in talking portraits. To tackle this challenge, we propose an automatic method based on blink embedding and hash grid landmarks encoding in this study, which can substantially enhance the fidelity of talking faces. Specifically, we leverage facial features encoded as conditional features and integrate audio features as residual terms into our model through a Dynamic Landmark Transformer. Furthermore, we employ neural radiance fields to model the entire face, resulting in a lifelike face representation. Experimental evaluations have validated the superiority of our approach to existing methods.

Abstract: Head avatar reenactment focuses on creating animatable personal avatars from monocular videos, serving as a foundational element for applications like social signal understanding, gaming, human-machine interaction, and computer vision. Recent advances in 3D Morphable Model (3DMM)-based facial reconstruction methods have achieved remarkable high-fidelity face estimation. However, on the one hand, they struggle to capture the entire head, including non-facial regions and background details in real time, which is an essential aspect for producing realistic, high-fidelity head avatars. On the other hand, recent approaches leveraging generative adversarial networks (GANs) for head avatar generation from videos can achieve high-quality reenactments but encounter limitations in reproducing fine-grained head details, such as wrinkles and hair textures. In addition, existing methods generally rely on a large amount of training data, and rarely focus on using only a simple selfie video to achieve avatar reenactment. To address these challenges, this study introduces a method for detailed head avatar reenactment using a selfie video. The approach combines 3DMMs with a StyleGAN-based generator. A detailed reconstruction model is proposed, incorporating mixed loss functions for foreground reconstruction and avatar image generation during adversarial training to recover high-frequency details. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations on self-reenactment and cross-reenactment tasks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior head avatar reconstruction with rich and intricate textures compared to existing approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于统计的训练图像检测框架，通过组合训练统计方法提高检测的可解释性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检测方法缺乏可解释性且依赖隐含假设，可能在分布变化时表现不佳。

Method: 通过多种检测器计算p值并使用统计集成方法评估图像与真实图像分布的对齐性。

Result: 框架具有通用性、灵活性且无需训练，适用于不同及演化的检测场景。

Conclusion: 为适应生成模型的发展提供了更可靠且可解释的检测方案。

Abstract: As generative models continue to evolve, detecting AI-generated images remains a critical challenge. While effective detection methods exist, they often lack formal interpretability and may rely on implicit assumptions about fake content, potentially limiting robustness to distributional shifts. In this work, we introduce a rigorous, statistically grounded framework for fake image detection that focuses on producing a probability score interpretable with respect to the real-image population. Our method leverages the strengths of multiple existing detectors by combining training-free statistics. We compute p-values over a range of test statistics and aggregate them using classical statistical ensembling to assess alignment with the unified real-image distribution. This framework is generic, flexible, and training-free, making it well-suited for robust fake image detection across diverse and evolving settings.

### [5] [Smart Split-Federated Learning over Noisy Channels for Embryo Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18948)
*Zahra Hafezi Kafshgari,Ivan V. Bajic,Parvaneh Saeedi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Split-Federated (SplitFed) learning minimizes client hardware requirements by deploying only part of the model on clients, with a focus on mitigating communication channel noise through a smart averaging strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Noise in communication channels can degrade model quality and hinder training efficiency in SplitFed learning, necessitating strategies to improve resilience.

Method: A smart averaging strategy was proposed to enhance SplitFed learning's robustness against channel noise, tested via experiments on a segmentation model for embryo images.

Result: The smart averaging strategy tolerated 100x stronger noise levels than conventional averaging while retaining model accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed strategy effectively improves SplitFed learning's resistance to noisy communication channels without compromising model performance.

Abstract: Split-Federated (SplitFed) learning is an extension of federated learning that places minimal requirements on the clients computing infrastructure, since only a small portion of the overall model is deployed on the clients hardware. In SplitFed learning, feature values, gradient updates, and model updates are transferred across communication channels. In this paper, we study the effects of noise in the communication channels on the learning process and the quality of the final model. We propose a smart averaging strategy for SplitFed learning with the goal of improving resilience against channel noise. Experiments on a segmentation model for embryo images shows that the proposed smart averaging strategy is able to tolerate two orders of magnitude stronger noise in the communication channels compared to conventional averaging, while still maintaining the accuracy of the final model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 少样本新视角合成中，传统方法假设所有输入视角对目标视角的重要性相同，导致合成结果不够理想。需要通过动态权重机制优化视角选择。

Method: 提出两种方案：1) 基于欧式距离和角度差异的几何确定性权重分配；2) 交叉注意力机制学习权重参数，并可微调模型整合视角相关性。

Result: 实验证明该方法在多个NVS框架中均能提升合成质量，显著提高视角重建的准确性与视觉真实感，且无需增加额外参数量。

Conclusion: 自适应视角权重机制能有效解决少样本视角缺失问题，为新视角合成任务提供了可扩展的技术路径。

Abstract: Novel view synthesis (NVS) has advanced with generative modeling, enabling photorealistic image generation. In few-shot NVS, where only a few input views are available, existing methods often assume equal importance for all input views relative to the target, leading to suboptimal results.
  We address this limitation by introducing a camera-weighting mechanism that adjusts the importance of source views based on their relevance to the target. We propose two approaches: a deterministic weighting scheme leveraging geometric properties like Euclidean distance and angular differences, and a cross-attention-based learning scheme that optimizes view weighting. Additionally, models can be further trained with our camera-weighting scheme to refine their understanding of view relevance and enhance synthesis quality. This mechanism is adaptable and can be integrated into various NVS algorithms, improving their ability to synthesize high-quality novel views. Our results demonstrate that adaptive view weighting enhances accuracy and realism, offering a promising direction for improving NVS.

### [7] [Anatomically-aware conformal prediction for medical image segmentation with random walks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18997)
*Mélanie Gaillochet,Christian Desrosiers,Hervé Lombaert*

Main category: cs.CV

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Result: 在α=0.1误差率下，多模态数据集分割质量提升35.4%，保持严格边际覆盖率的同时获得连续解剖边界

Conclusion: RW-CP通过引入扩散不确定性，在保证统计有效性的同时显著提升医学影像分割结果的临床可用性

Abstract: The reliable deployment of deep learning in medical imaging requires uncertainty quantification that provides rigorous error guarantees while remaining anatomically meaningful. Conformal prediction (CP) is a powerful distribution-free framework for constructing statistically valid prediction intervals. However, standard applications in segmentation often ignore anatomical context, resulting in fragmented, spatially incoherent, and over-segmented prediction sets that limit clinical utility. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes Random-Walk Conformal Prediction (RW-CP), a model-agnostic framework which can be added on top of any segmentation method. RW-CP enforces spatial coherence to generate anatomically valid sets. Our method constructs a k-nearest neighbour graph from pre-trained vision foundation model features and applies a random walk to diffuse uncertainty. The random walk diffusion regularizes the non-conformity scores, making the prediction sets less sensitive to the conformal calibration parameter $λ$, ensuring more stable and continuous anatomical boundaries. RW-CP maintains rigorous marginal coverage while significantly improving segmentation quality. Evaluations on multi-modal public datasets show improvements of up to $35.4\%$ compared to standard CP baselines, given an allowable error rate of $α=0.1$.

Abstract: Chronic wound monitoring and management require accurate and efficient wound measurement methods. This paper presents a fast, non-invasive 3D wound measurement algorithm based on RGB-D imaging. The method combines RGB-D odometry with B-spline surface reconstruction to generate detailed 3D wound meshes, enabling automatic computation of clinically relevant wound measurements such as perimeter, surface area, and dimensions. We evaluated our system on realistic silicone wound phantoms and measured sub-millimetre 3D reconstruction accuracy compared with high-resolution ground-truth scans. The extracted measurements demonstrated low variability across repeated captures and strong agreement with manual assessments. The proposed pipeline also outperformed a state-of-the-art object-centric RGB-D reconstruction method while maintaining runtimes suitable for real-time clinical deployment. Our approach offers a promising tool for automated wound assessment in both clinical and remote healthcare settings.

*Ines Vati,Pierrick Bourgeat,Rodrigo Santa Cruz,Vincent Dore,Olivier Salvado,Clinton Fookes,Léo Lebrat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces neural cortical maps as a continuous, compact alternative to discrete structures for cortical feature representation


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional discrete cortical representations (grids/meshes) are limited by fixed resolution and processing inefficiency

Method: Combines neural cortical feature maps with gradient descent optimization and simulated annealing strategy in NC-Reg algorithm

Result: Achieves 30x faster runtime than barycentric interpolation with sub-degree registration accuracy (<1°)

Conclusion: Demonstrates neural cortical maps' potential for efficient, resolution-independent cortical processing in clinical applications

Abstract: We introduce neural cortical maps, a continuous and compact neural representation for cortical feature maps, as an alternative to traditional discrete structures such as grids and meshes. It can learn from meshes of arbitrary size and provide learnt features at any resolution. Neural cortical maps enable efficient optimization on the sphere and achieve runtimes up to 30 times faster than classic barycentric interpolation (for the same number of iterations). As a proof of concept, we investigate rigid registration of cortical surfaces and propose NC-Reg, a novel iterative algorithm that involves the use of neural cortical feature maps, gradient descent optimization and a simulated annealing strategy. Through ablation studies and subject-to-template experiments, our method demonstrates sub-degree accuracy ($<1^\circ$ from the global optimum), and serves as a promising robust pre-alignment strategy, which is critical in clinical settings.

Abstract: World generation is a fundamental capability for applications like video games, simulation, and robotics. However, existing approaches face three main obstacles: controllability, scalability, and efficiency. End-to-end scene generation models have been limited by data scarcity. While object-centric generation approaches rely on fixed resolution representations, degrading fidelity for larger scenes. Training-free approaches, while flexible, are often slow and computationally expensive at inference time. We present NuiWorld, a framework that attempts to address these challenges. To overcome data scarcity, we propose a generative bootstrapping strategy that starts from a few input images. Leveraging recent 3D reconstruction and expandable scene generation techniques, we synthesize scenes of varying sizes and layouts, producing enough data to train an end-to-end model. Furthermore, our framework enables controllability through pseudo sketch labels, and demonstrates a degree of generalization to previously unseen sketches. Our approach represents scenes as a collection of variable scene chunks, which are compressed into a flattened vector-set representation. This significantly reduces the token length for large scenes, enabling consistent geometric fidelity across scenes sizes while improving training and inference efficiency.

### [11] [Pixel-Grounded Retrieval for Knowledgeable Large Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19060)
*Jeonghwan Kim,Renjie Tao,Sanat Sharma,Jiaqi Wang,Kai Sun,Zhaojiang Lin,Seungwhan Moon,Lambert Mathias,Anuj Kumar,Heng Ji,Xin Luna Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PixSearch 是首个端到端的大型多模态模型（LMM），通过统一区域级感知和检索增强推理，在视觉问答（VQA）中实现更精准的事实相关性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态检索增强生成系统（MM-RAG）依赖预定义模块和固定流程，缺乏内部的检索时机与方式决策机制，导致事实一致性不足。

Method: 通过生成<search>标记动态触发检索，自适应选择文本/图像/区域模态，直接生成像素级掩码作为视觉查询，并采用两阶段监督微调训练策略。

Result: 在CRAG-MM数据集相对图像级检索模型实现19.7%的准确率提升，同时在多种VQA和纯文本问答任务中保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 该方法通过端到端联合训练实现了感知与检索的协同优化，为多模态问答系统提供了可学习的检索决策框架。

Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) often requires coupling fine-grained perception with factual knowledge beyond the input image. Prior multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MM-RAG) systems improve factual grounding but lack an internal policy for when and how to retrieve. We propose PixSearch, the first end-to-end Segmenting Large Multimodal Model (LMM) that unifies region-level perception and retrieval-augmented reasoning. During encoding, PixSearch emits <search> tokens to trigger retrieval, selects query modalities (text, image, or region), and generates pixel-level masks that directly serve as visual queries, eliminating the reliance on modular pipelines (detectors, segmenters, captioners, etc.). A two-stage supervised fine-tuning regimen with search-interleaved supervision teaches retrieval timing and query selection while preserving segmentation ability. On egocentric and entity-centric VQA benchmarks, PixSearch substantially improves factual consistency and generalization, yielding a 19.7% relative gain in accuracy on CRAG-MM compared to whole image retrieval, while retaining competitive reasoning performance on various VQA and text-only QA tasks.

### [12] [m2sv: A Scalable Benchmark for Map-to-Street-View Spatial Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19099)
*Yosub Shin,Michael Buriek,Igor Molybog*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: m2sv是一个新的、可扩展的基准测试，要求模型通过将北向地图与街景视图对齐来推断相机视角方向。当前顶尖模型仅65.2%准确率（人类基线95%）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态模型在空间推理任务中效果脆弱，尤其在需要对齐抽象俯视图与第一视角的任务上存在不足。

Method: 构建m2sv-20k基准数据集（包含20,000个地理多样化的交叉路口数据）及m2sv-sft-11k监督微调集，结合人类努力分析与模型失效分析进行多维度评估。（方法论：数据构建+模型测试+失败归因）

Result: 现有最佳VLM模型在m2sv上的准确率远低于人类基线（65.2% vs 95%），监督微调和强化学习效果有限，跨基准测试显示迁移能力不足。系统分析发现几何对齐、证据聚合和推理一致性存在显著缺陷。

Conclusion: 揭示了跨视角空间推理的技术缺口（几何对齐、多源证据整合、推理连贯性），强调未来需强化模型对真实世界空间关系的建模能力。

Abstract: Vision--language models (VLMs) achieve strong performance on many multimodal benchmarks but remain brittle on spatial reasoning tasks that require aligning abstract overhead representations with egocentric views. We introduce m2sv, a scalable benchmark for map-to-street-view spatial reasoning that asks models to infer camera viewing direction by aligning a north-up overhead map with a Street View image captured at the same real-world intersection. We release m2sv-20k, a geographically diverse benchmark with controlled ambiguity, along with m2sv-sft-11k, a curated set of structured reasoning traces for supervised fine-tuning.
  Despite strong performance on existing multimodal benchmarks, the best evaluated VLM achieves only 65.2% accuracy on m2sv, far below the human baseline of 95%. While supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning yield consistent gains, cross-benchmark evaluations reveal limited transfer. Beyond aggregate accuracy, we systematically analyze difficulty in map-to-street-view reasoning using both structural signals and human effort, and conduct an extensive failure analysis of adapted open models. Our findings highlight persistent gaps in geometric alignment, evidence aggregation, and reasoning consistency, motivating future work on grounded spatial reasoning across viewpoints.

### [13] [Glance and Focus Reinforcement for Pan-cancer Screening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19103)
*Linshan Wu,Jiaxin Zhuang,Hao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Pan-cancer screening in CT scans is hindered by foreground-background imbalance and inefficient lesion localization. GF-Screen, a Glance and Focus reinforcement learning framework, addresses these challenges via a group relative learning paradigm, achieving state-of-the-art performance on large-scale datasets and the MICCAI FLARE25 challenge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI methods struggle with detecting diverse tiny lesions in large CT volumes due to extreme foreground-background imbalance. Radiologists' 'glance and focus' strategy inspired a solution to prioritize diseased regions, reducing false positives and computational redundancy.

Method: GF-Screen uses two models: (1) a Glance model that localizes diseased regions by selecting sub-volumes and (2) a Focus model that segments lesions. Segmentation results from the Focus model reward the Glance model via reinforcement learning. A group relative learning paradigm enables the Glance model to prioritize high-advantage sub-volumes while discarding low-advantage ones.

Result: GF-Screen demonstrated superior performance on 16 internal and 7 external datasets (9 lesion types), achieving a 25.6% increase in DSC and 28.2% in NSD compared to the prior best solution (FLARE24 champion). It currently leads the MICCAI FLARE25 public validation leaderboard.

Conclusion: GF-Screen bridges the gap between cutting-edge RL techniques and real-world challenges in pan-cancer screening, improving efficiency and accuracy. Its dual-model framework and group relative learning paradigm set a new benchmark for lesion detection and segmentation in large-scale CT scans.

Abstract: Pan-cancer screening in large-scale CT scans remains challenging for existing AI methods, primarily due to the difficulty of localizing diverse types of tiny lesions in large CT volumes. The extreme foreground-background imbalance significantly hinders models from focusing on diseased regions, while redundant focus on healthy regions not only decreases the efficiency but also increases false positives. Inspired by radiologists' glance and focus diagnostic strategy, we introduce GF-Screen, a Glance and Focus reinforcement learning framework for pan-cancer screening. GF-Screen employs a Glance model to localize the diseased regions and a Focus model to precisely segment the lesions, where segmentation results of the Focus model are leveraged to reward the Glance model via Reinforcement Learning (RL). Specifically, the Glance model crops a group of sub-volumes from the entire CT volume and learns to select the sub-volumes with lesions for the Focus model to segment. Given that the selecting operation is non-differentiable for segmentation training, we propose to employ the segmentation results to reward the Glance model. To optimize the Glance model, we introduce a novel group relative learning paradigm, which employs group relative comparison to prioritize high-advantage predictions and discard low-advantage predictions within sub-volume groups, not only improving efficiency but also reducing false positives. In this way, for the first time, we effectively extend cutting-edge RL techniques to tackle the specific challenges in pan-cancer screening. Extensive experiments on 16 internal and 7 external datasets across 9 lesion types demonstrated the effectiveness of GF-Screen. Notably, GF-Screen leads the public validation leaderboard of MICCAI FLARE25 pan-cancer challenge, surpassing the FLARE24 champion solution by a large margin (+25.6% DSC and +28.2% NSD).

Result: 在两个任务上实现SOTA性能，推理时间增加0.56秒（21%），保持与原始深度学习方法相近的速度。

Conclusion: Reg-TTR有效弥合了基础模型与专用模型间的性能差距，为未来基础模型的实用化提供高效策略。

Abstract: Traditional image registration methods are robust but slow due to their iterative nature. While deep learning has accelerated inference, it often struggles with domain shifts. Emerging registration foundation models offer a balance of speed and robustness, yet typically cannot match the peak accuracy of specialized models trained on specific datasets. To mitigate this limitation, we propose Reg-TTR, a test-time refinement framework that synergizes the complementary strengths of both deep learning and conventional registration techniques. By refining the predictions of pre-trained models at inference, our method delivers significantly improved registration accuracy at a modest computational cost, requiring only 21% additional inference time (0.56s). We evaluate Reg-TTR on two distinct tasks and show that it achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance while maintaining inference speeds close to previous deep learning methods. As foundation models continue to emerge, our framework offers an efficient strategy to narrow the performance gap between registration foundation models and SOTA methods trained on specialized datasets. The source code will be publicly available following the acceptance of this work.

Abstract: With large-scale text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models achieving significant advancements in open-domain image creation, increasing attention has been focused on their natural extension to the realm of text-driven image-to-image (I2I) translation, where a source image acts as visual guidance to the generated image in addition to the textual guidance provided by the text prompt. We propose FBSDiff, a novel framework adapting off-the-shelf T2I diffusion model into the I2I paradigm from a fresh frequency-domain perspective. Through dynamic frequency band substitution of diffusion features, FBSDiff realizes versatile and highly controllable text-driven I2I in a plug-and-play manner (without need for model training, fine-tuning, or online optimization), allowing appearance-guided, layout-guided, and contour-guided I2I translation by progressively substituting low-frequency band, mid-frequency band, and high-frequency band of latent diffusion features, respectively. In addition, FBSDiff flexibly enables continuous control over I2I correlation intensity simply by tuning the bandwidth of the substituted frequency band. To further promote image translation efficiency, flexibility, and functionality, we propose FBSDiff++ which improves upon FBSDiff mainly in three aspects: (1) accelerate inference speed by a large margin (8.9$\times$ speedup in inference) with refined model architecture; (2) improve the Frequency Band Substitution module to allow for input source images of arbitrary resolution and aspect ratio; (3) extend model functionality to enable localized image manipulation and style-specific content creation with only subtle adjustments to the core method. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments verify superiority of FBSDiff++ in I2I translation visual quality, efficiency, versatility, and controllability compared to related advanced approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的域对抗学习方法（GB-DAL），通过生成更密集的域和模拟非因果因素来提升开放世界目标检测的域不变特征学习效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的域对抗学习方法因稀疏的域标签和隐式非因果因素导致域不变表征学习不充分，需解决这些限制以提升模型泛化能力。

Method: 基于Granular-Ball视角，使用原型聚类的Granular-Ball分割模块生成密集体域，并设计模拟非因果因素的数据增强模块（SNF）以降低其隐式性。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，GB-DAL在开放世界目标检测任务中展现出更优的泛化性能，特别是在新环境下的适应能力。

Conclusion: 通过稠密域生成和非因果因素显式建模，有效解决了域对抗学习中的隐式非因果因素问题，为开放世界检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Open world object detection faces a significant challenge in domain-invariant representation, i.e., implicit non-causal factors. Most domain generalization (DG) methods based on domain adversarial learning (DAL) pay much attention to learn domain-invariant information, but often overlook the potential non-causal factors. We unveil two critical causes: 1) The domain discriminator-based DAL method is subject to the extremely sparse domain label, i.e., assigning only one domain label to each dataset, thus can only associate explicit non-causal factor, which is incredibly limited. 2) The non-causal factors, induced by unidentified data bias, are excessively implicit and cannot be solely discerned by conventional DAL paradigm. Based on these key findings, inspired by the Granular-Ball perspective, we propose an improved DAL method, i.e., GB-DAL. The proposed GB-DAL utilizes Prototype-based Granular Ball Splitting (PGBS) module to generate more dense domains from limited datasets, akin to more fine-grained granular balls, indicating more potential non-causal factors. Inspired by adversarial perturbations akin to non-causal factors, we propose a Simulated Non-causal Factors (SNF) module as a means of data augmentation to reduce the implicitness of non-causal factors, and facilitate the training of GB-DAL. Comparative experiments on numerous benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves better generalization performance in novel circumstances.

TL;DR: The paper introduces QA-ReID, a novel method for clothes-changing person re-identification (CC-ReID) that combines RGB and parsing-based features with a quality-aware matching strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional ReID methods struggle with significant appearance variations caused by clothing changes, necessitating models that capture clothing-invariant features.

Method: QA-ReID integrates global appearance and structural cues via a dual-branch network (RGB and parsing features) with adaptive fusion, followed by a quality-aware query-adaptive convolution (QAConv-QA) that emphasizes pixel importance and bidirectional consistency.

Result: QA-ReID achieves superior performance on CC-ReID benchmarks (PRCC, LTCC, VC-Clothes), surpassing state-of-the-art methods in cross-clothing scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed quality-aware dual-branch matching framework effectively handles clothing variations by leveraging multimodal attention and adaptive importance weighting.

Abstract: Unlike conventional person re-identification (ReID), clothes-changing ReID (CC-ReID) presents severe challenges due to substantial appearance variations introduced by clothing changes. In this work, we propose the Quality-Aware Dual-Branch Matching (QA-ReID), which jointly leverages RGB-based features and parsing-based representations to model both global appearance and clothing-invariant structural cues. These heterogeneous features are adaptively fused through a multi-modal attention module. At the matching stage, we further design the Quality-Aware Query Adaptive Convolution (QAConv-QA), which incorporates pixel-level importance weighting and bidirectional consistency constraints to enhance robustness against clothing variations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that QA-ReID achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, including PRCC, LTCC, and VC-Clothes, and significantly outperforms existing approaches under cross-clothing scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SNR-Edit，一种无需训练的高质量图像编辑框架，通过自适应噪声控制解决流式生成模型的结构退化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有流式生成模型依赖固定高斯噪声导致轨迹偏差，需开发无需模型调参且保持结构完整性的解决方案。

Method: 结构感知噪声校正：利用分割约束调整初始噪声，将轨迹随机分量锚定到真实图像隐式反转位置，通过轻量级操作减少轨迹漂移。

Result: 在SD3/FLUX模型和PIE-Bench/SNR-Bench基准中，达到像素级指标和视觉语言模型评分最优性能，单图处理仅增加1秒延迟。

Conclusion: 成功实现训练无关、低开销的高质量图像编辑，为流式生成模型提供了结构保真度新范式。

Abstract: Inversion-free image editing using flow-based generative models challenges the prevailing inversion-based pipelines. However, existing approaches rely on fixed Gaussian noise to construct the source trajectory, leading to biased trajectory dynamics and causing structural degradation or quality loss. To address this, we introduce SNR-Edit, a training-free framework achieving faithful Latent Trajectory Correction via adaptive noise control. Mechanistically, SNR-Edit uses structure-aware noise rectification to inject segmentation constraints into the initial noise, anchoring the stochastic component of the source trajectory to the real image's implicit inversion position and reducing trajectory drift during source--target transport. This lightweight modification yields smoother latent trajectories and ensures high-fidelity structural preservation without requiring model tuning or inversion. Across SD3 and FLUX, evaluations on PIE-Bench and SNR-Bench show that SNR-Edit delivers performance on pixel-level metrics and VLM-based scoring, while adding only about 1s overhead per image.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CSR，通过频谱引导对比优化提升VLMs对抗攻击鲁棒性，输入自适应且低延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时防御方法面对强对抗攻击时鲁棒性不足，且存在高延迟和任务特异性限制，需设计更高效通用的防御方案。

Method: 通过分析对抗样本（AEs）在频率衰减下的特征不一致性，归因于模型谱偏置。CSR通过输入自适应的频谱引导对比目标优化修正扰动，对齐输入至自然流形。

Result: 在16个分类基准中，CSR平均优于SOTA 18.1%（面对AutoAttack），仅引入适中的推理开销，且支持多视觉任务。

Conclusion: CSR平衡防御效果与效率，具多任务适用性，开源代码推动后续研究。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP have demonstrated remarkable zero-shot generalization, yet remain highly vulnerable to adversarial examples (AEs). While test-time defenses are promising, existing methods fail to provide sufficient robustness against strong attacks and are often hampered by high inference latency and task-specific applicability. To address these limitations, we start by investigating the intrinsic properties of AEs, which reveals that AEs exhibit severe feature inconsistency under progressive frequency attenuation. We further attribute this to the model's inherent spectral bias. Leveraging this insight, we propose an efficient test-time defense named Contrastive Spectral Rectification (CSR). CSR optimizes a rectification perturbation to realign the input with the natural manifold under a spectral-guided contrastive objective, which is applied input-adaptively. Extensive experiments across 16 classification benchmarks demonstrate that CSR outperforms the SOTA by an average of 18.1% against strong AutoAttack with modest inference overhead. Furthermore, CSR exhibits broad applicability across diverse visual tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/Summu77/CSR.

*Fuxiang Sun,Xi Jiang,Jiansheng Wu,Haigang Zhang,Feng Zheng,Jinfeng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces UniPCB, the first unified vision-language benchmark for PCB quality inspection, and PCB-GPT, an MLLM trained with a progressive curriculum, achieving superior performance in defect localization compared to existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs struggle with PCB inspection due to complex structures and lack of a standardized benchmark. Fragmented datasets and limited high-quality data hinder progress in this domain-specific task requiring specialized expertise.

Method: The authors established UniPCB via a systematic pipeline integrating three annotated scenarios and developed PCB-GPT using an instruction dataset with a progressive curriculum mimicking human expert learning. This approach standardizes evaluation and improves model adaptation to PCB-specific challenges.

Result: PCB-GPT outperformed existing MLLMs, doubling fine-grained defect localization accuracy and demonstrating significant improvements in localization precision and analysis on the UniPCB benchmark.

Conclusion: UniPCB addresses the critical gap in standardized evaluation for PCB inspection, while PCB-GPT sets a new baseline for MLLMs in domain-specific industrial quality tasks, enabling future research through open-sourced resources.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show promise for general industrial quality inspection, but fall short in complex scenarios, such as Printed Circuit Board (PCB) inspection. PCB inspection poses unique challenges due to densely packed components, complex wiring structures, and subtle defect patterns that require specialized domain expertise. However, a high-quality, unified vision-language benchmark for quantitatively evaluating MLLMs across PCB inspection tasks remains absent, stemming not only from limited data availability but also from fragmented datasets and inconsistent standardization. To fill this gap, we propose UniPCB, the first unified vision-language benchmark for open-ended PCB quality inspection. UniPCB is built via a systematic pipeline that curates and standardizes data from disparate sources across three annotated scenarios. Furthermore, we introduce PCB-GPT, an MLLM trained on a new instruction dataset generated by this pipeline, utilizing a novel progressive curriculum that mimics the learning process of human experts. Evaluations on the UniPCB benchmark show that while existing MLLMs falter on domain-specific tasks, PCB-GPT establishes a new baseline. Notably, it more than doubles the performance on fine-grained defect localization compared to the strongest competitors, with significant advantages in localization and analysis. We will release the instruction data, benchmark, and model to facilitate future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分割方法依赖复杂架构设计，而本文旨在验证标准MLLM固有的低层感知能力是否能满足高精度分割需求。

Method: 将分割转化为点坐标的文本序列生成任务，利用两阶段SF→RL训练：先监督训练生成边界点序列，再用IoU奖励的强化学习优化序列匹配真实轮廓。

Result: SimpleSeg在分割基准测试中表现与主流方法相当甚至更优，且无需专门架构设计即可实现像素级感知。

Conclusion: 证明MLLM固有空间理解能力可通过简单序列预测激活，该方法挑战了传统分割模型对辅助组件的依赖性。

Abstract: We present SimpleSeg, a strikingly simple yet highly effective approach to endow Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with native pixel-level perception. Our method reframes segmentation as a simple sequence generation problem: the model directly predicts sequences of points (textual coordinates) delineating object boundaries, entirely within its language space. To achieve high fidelity, we introduce a two-stage SF$\to$RL training pipeline, where Reinforcement Learning with an IoU-based reward refines the point sequences to accurately match ground-truth contours. We find that the standard MLLM architecture possesses a strong, inherent capacity for low-level perception that can be unlocked without any specialized architecture. On segmentation benchmarks, SimpleSeg achieves performance that is comparable to, and often surpasses, methods relying on complex, task-specific designs. This work lays out that precise spatial understanding can emerge from simple point prediction, challenging the prevailing need for auxiliary components and paving the way for more unified and capable VLMs. Homepage: https://simpleseg.github.io/

Method: 创建VC-Bench基准，包含1,579个高质量视频，覆盖15类72子类，评估VQS、SECS、TSS三个核心指标。

Result: 实验发现现有模型在起始一致性与过渡平滑性上存在显著不足，导致整体连贯性下降。

Conclusion: 预期VC-Bench将推动视频连接领域的技术发展，评估数据已公开。

Abstract: While current video generation focuses on text or image conditions, practical applications like video editing and vlogging often need to seamlessly connect separate clips. In our work, we introduce Video Connecting, an innovative task that aims to generate smooth intermediate video content between given start and end clips. However, the absence of standardized evaluation benchmarks has hindered the development of this task. To bridge this gap, we proposed VC-Bench, a novel benchmark specifically designed for video connecting. It includes 1,579 high-quality videos collected from public platforms, covering 15 main categories and 72 subcategories to ensure diversity and structure. VC-Bench focuses on three core aspects: Video Quality Score VQS, Start-End Consistency Score SECS, and Transition Smoothness Score TSS. Together, they form a comprehensive framework that moves beyond conventional quality-only metrics. We evaluated multiple state-of-the-art video generation models on VC-Bench. Experimental results reveal significant limitations in maintaining start-end consistency and transition smoothness, leading to lower overall coherence and fluidity. We expect that VC-Bench will serve as a pioneering benchmark to inspire and guide future research in video connecting.

Conclusion: 基于3D高斯泼溅的模态解耦与对齐策略有效提升了3D多模态任务的性能表现。

Abstract: While visual-language models have profoundly linked features between texts and images, the incorporation of 3D modality data, such as point clouds and 3D Gaussians, further enables pretraining for 3D-related tasks, e.g., cross-modal retrieval, zero-shot classification, and scene recognition. As challenges remain in extracting 3D modal features and bridging the gap between different modalities, we propose TIGaussian, a framework that harnesses 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) characteristics to strengthen cross-modality alignment through multi-branch 3DGS tokenizer and modality-specific 3D feature alignment strategies. Specifically, our multi-branch 3DGS tokenizer decouples the intrinsic properties of 3DGS structures into compact latent representations, enabling more generalizable feature extraction. To further bridge the modality gap, we develop a bidirectional cross-modal alignment strategies: a multi-view feature fusion mechanism that leverages diffusion priors to resolve perspective ambiguity in image-3D alignment, while a text-3D projection module adaptively maps 3D features to text embedding space for better text-3D alignment. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of TIGaussian in multiple tasks.

Conclusion: 结合无监督领域适应与半监督学习，通过去偏校正、伪负样本挖掘和跨域特征对齐，显著降低标注成本并提升跨领域分类性能。

Abstract: Semi-Supervised Domain Adaptation (SSDA) leverages knowledge from a fully labeled source domain to classify data in a partially labeled target domain. Due to the limited number of labeled samples in the target domain, there can be intrinsic similarity of classes in the feature space, which may result in biased predictions, even when the model is trained on a balanced dataset. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a multi-view consistency framework, which includes two views for training strongly augmented data. One is a debiasing strategy for correcting class-wise prediction probabilities according to the prediction performance of the model. The other involves leveraging pseudo-negative labels derived from the model predictions. Furthermore, we introduce a cross-domain affinity learning aimed at aligning features of the same class across different domains, thereby enhancing overall performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the competing methods on two standard domain adaptation datasets, DomainNet and Office-Home. Combining unsupervised domain adaptation and semi-supervised learning offers indispensable contributions to the industrial sector by enhancing model adaptability, reducing annotation costs, and improving performance.

Abstract: Pro-Mist filters are widely used in cinematography for their ability to create soft halation, lower contrast, and produce a distinctive, atmospheric style. These effects are difficult to reproduce digitally due to the complex behavior of light diffusion. We present ProMist-5K, a dataset designed to support cinematic style emulation. It is built using a physically inspired pipeline in a scene-referred linear space and includes 20,000 high-resolution image pairs across four configurations, covering two filter densities (1/2 and 1/8) and two focal lengths (20mm and 50mm). Unlike general style datasets, ProMist-5K focuses on realistic glow and highlight diffusion effects. Multiple blur layers and carefully tuned weighting are used to model the varying intensity and spread of optical diffusion. The dataset provides a consistent and controllable target domain that supports various image translation models and learning paradigms. Experiments show that the dataset works well across different training settings and helps capture both subtle and strong cinematic appearances. ProMist-5K offers a practical and physically grounded resource for film-inspired image transformation, bridging the gap between digital flexibility and traditional lens aesthetics.

Conclusion: 显式深度监督与雷达引导有效优化3D检测，未来将结合点云表示与时间信息提升BEV融合性能。

Abstract: Accurate depth estimation is fundamental to 3D perception in autonomous driving, supporting tasks such as detection, tracking, and motion planning. However, monocular camera-based 3D detection suffers from depth ambiguity and reduced robustness under challenging conditions. Radar provides complementary advantages such as resilience to poor lighting and adverse weather, but its sparsity and low resolution limit its direct use in detection frameworks. This motivates the need for effective Radar-camera fusion with improved preprocessing and depth estimation strategies. We propose an end-to-end framework that enhances monocular 3D object detection through two key components. First, we introduce InstaRadar, an instance segmentation-guided expansion method that leverages pre-trained segmentation masks to enhance Radar density and semantic alignment, producing a more structured representation. InstaRadar achieves state-of-the-art results in Radar-guided depth estimation, showing its effectiveness in generating high-quality depth features. Second, we integrate the pre-trained RCDPT into the BEVDepth framework as a replacement for its depth module. With InstaRadar-enhanced inputs, the RCDPT integration consistently improves 3D detection performance. Overall, these components yield steady gains over the baseline BEVDepth model, demonstrating the effectiveness of InstaRadar and the advantage of explicit depth supervision in 3D object detection. Although the framework lags behind Radar-camera fusion models that directly extract BEV features, since Radar serves only as guidance rather than an independent feature stream, this limitation highlights potential for improvement. Future work will extend InstaRadar to point cloud-like representations and integrate a dedicated Radar branch with temporal cues for enhanced BEV fusion.

Abstract: We present Innovator-VL, a scientific multimodal large language model designed to advance understanding and reasoning across diverse scientific domains while maintaining excellent performance on general vision tasks. Contrary to the trend of relying on massive domain-specific pretraining and opaque pipelines, our work demonstrates that principled training design and transparent methodology can yield strong scientific intelligence with substantially reduced data requirements. (i) First, we provide a fully transparent, end-to-end reproducible training pipeline, covering data collection, cleaning, preprocessing, supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and evaluation, along with detailed optimization recipes. This facilitates systematic extension by the community. (ii) Second, Innovator-VL exhibits remarkable data efficiency, achieving competitive performance on various scientific tasks using fewer than five million curated samples without large-scale pretraining. These results highlight that effective reasoning can be achieved through principled data selection rather than indiscriminate scaling. (iii) Third, Innovator-VL demonstrates strong generalization, achieving competitive performance on general vision, multimodal reasoning, and scientific benchmarks. This indicates that scientific alignment can be integrated into a unified model without compromising general-purpose capabilities. Our practices suggest that efficient, reproducible, and high-performing scientific multimodal models can be built even without large-scale data, providing a practical foundation for future research.

Conclusion: 区域渐进学习框架通过梯度方差约束和帕累托优化，有效解决医学图像分割中的非均匀不确定性问题，为临床决策提供更可靠的分割结果

Abstract: Uncertainty in medical image segmentation is inherently non-uniform, with boundary regions exhibiting substantially higher ambiguity than interior areas. Conventional training treats all pixels equally, leading to unstable optimization during early epochs when predictions are unreliable. We argue that this instability hinders convergence toward Pareto-optimal solutions and propose a region-wise curriculum strategy that prioritizes learning from certain regions and gradually incorporates uncertain ones, reducing gradient variance. Methodologically, we introduce a Pareto-consistent loss that balances trade-offs between regional uncertainties by adaptively reshaping the loss landscape and constraining convergence dynamics between interior and boundary regions; this guides the model toward Pareto-approximate solutions. To address boundary ambiguity, we further develop a fuzzy labeling mechanism that maintains binary confidence in non-boundary areas while enabling smooth transitions near boundaries, stabilizing gradients, and expanding flat regions in the loss surface. Experiments on brain metastasis and non-metastatic tumor segmentation show consistent improvements across multiple configurations, with our method outperforming traditional crisp-set approaches in all tumor subregions.

Motivation: 临床医生和皮肤病学病理培训人员难以获取高质量的开放获取病理图像数据集进行学习和交叉参考。

Method: 结合关键词提取、深度学习模态分类与图像标题分析的混合方法进行图像筛选分类。

Result: 在651张手动标注图像验证中，混合方法F分数达90.4%，最终获取包含166种诊断的7,772张图像。

Conclusion: 成功构建了经专家审核的开放获取皮肤病学病理图像数据集DermpathNet，但现有人工智能算法分析效果有限。

Abstract: Accessing high-quality, open-access dermatopathology image datasets for learning and cross-referencing is a common challenge for clinicians and dermatopathology trainees. To establish a comprehensive open-access dermatopathology dataset for educational, cross-referencing, and machine-learning purposes, we employed a hybrid workflow to curate and categorize images from the PubMed Central (PMC) repository. We used specific keywords to extract relevant images, and classified them using a novel hybrid method that combined deep learning-based image modality classification with figure caption analyses. Validation on 651 manually annotated images demonstrated the robustness of our workflow, with an F-score of 89.6\% for the deep learning approach, 61.0\% for the keyword-based retrieval method, and 90.4\% for the hybrid approach. We retrieved over 7,772 images across 166 diagnoses and released this fully annotated dataset, reviewed by board-certified dermatopathologists. Using our dataset as a challenging task, we found the current image analysis algorithm from OpenAI inadequate for analyzing dermatopathology images. In conclusion, we have developed a large, peer-reviewed, open-access dermatopathology image dataset, DermpathNet, which features a semi-automated curation workflow.

TL;DR: 本论文提出X-AIGD，一种用于AI生成图像检测的细粒度可解释性基准，包含像素级的感知伪影标注，涵盖低级失真、高级语义和认知级反事实，并揭示了现有检测模型的局限性与改进方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI生成图像（AIGI）检测方法依赖二分类且缺乏可解释性，现有基准在伪影多样性和详细标注（尤其是像素级标注）上存在不足，限制了模型可解释性研究。

Method: 构建X-AIGD基准，提供像素级分类标注（低级失真、高级语义、认知级伪影）；利用该基准量化分析现有检测模型对伪影的依赖程度及可解释性，并测试特定训练策略（如注意力对齐）效果。

Result: 现有检测模型几乎不依赖感知伪影（甚至基础失真），且仍通过不可解释特征进行判断；通过显式对齐模型注意力与伪影区域，可提升模型可解释性与泛化能力。

Conclusion: X-AIGD通过结构化标注推动了AI生成图像检测的可解释性研究，证明了标注引导的模型改进（如注意力对齐）在提升检测可靠性与透明度上的有效性。

Abstract: Current AI-Generated Image (AIGI) detection approaches predominantly rely on binary classification to distinguish real from synthetic images, often lacking interpretable or convincing evidence to substantiate their decisions. This limitation stems from existing AIGI detection benchmarks, which, despite featuring a broad collection of synthetic images, remain restricted in their coverage of artifact diversity and lack detailed, localized annotations. To bridge this gap, we introduce a fine-grained benchmark towards eXplainable AI-Generated image Detection, named X-AIGD, which provides pixel-level, categorized annotations of perceptual artifacts, spanning low-level distortions, high-level semantics, and cognitive-level counterfactuals. These comprehensive annotations facilitate fine-grained interpretability evaluation and deeper insight into model decision-making processes. Our extensive investigation using X-AIGD provides several key insights: (1) Existing AIGI detectors demonstrate negligible reliance on perceptual artifacts, even at the most basic distortion level. (2) While AIGI detectors can be trained to identify specific artifacts, they still substantially base their judgment on uninterpretable features. (3) Explicitly aligning model attention with artifact regions can increase the interpretability and generalization of detectors. The data and code are available at: https://github.com/Coxy7/X-AIGD.

Conclusion: DSTCS框架为临床提供了可靠的PSFH分割工具，验证了多模态架构与任务定制化设计在医学图像分割中的有效性。

Abstract: Segmentation of the pubic symphysis and fetal head (PSFH) is a critical procedure in intrapartum monitoring and is essential for evaluating labor progression and identifying potential delivery complications. However, achieving accurate segmentation remains a significant challenge due to class imbalance, ambiguous boundaries, and noise interference in ultrasound images, compounded by the scarcity of high-quality annotated data. Current research on PSFH segmentation predominantly relies on CNN and Transformer architectures, leaving the potential of more powerful models underexplored. In this work, we propose a Dual-Student and Teacher framework combining CNN and SAM (DSTCS), which integrates the Segment Anything Model (SAM) into a dual student-teacher architecture. A cooperative learning mechanism between the CNN and SAM branches significantly improves segmentation accuracy. The proposed scheme also incorporates a specialized data augmentation strategy optimized for boundary processing and a novel loss function. Extensive experiments on the MICCAI 2023 and 2024 PSFH segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our method exhibits superior robustness and significantly outperforms existing techniques, providing a reliable segmentation tool for clinical practice.

TL;DR: 本论文系统评估了八种零样本深度估计方法在植被密集环境中的表现，提出新Canterbury Tree Branches数据集，发现DEFOM基础模型在跨域一致性上最优，可作为植被深度估计的伪真值基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市/室内场景主导的深度估计研究无法满足植被密集环境的无人机作业需求，现有方法在跨域泛化能力存在显著空白，亟需面向林业场景的系统性零样本性能评估与基准建立。

Method: 对迭代优化（IGEV++/IGEV）、基础模型（BridgeDepth/DEFOM）、扩散模型、3D CNN等八类方法进行零样本迁移实验，采用Scene Flow预训练权重，在ETH3D/KITTI/Middlebury标准集及新构建的5313对Canterbury树木枝桠数据集（1920×1080）进行量化评估与定性分析。

Result: 基础模型DEFOM在ETH3D（0.23px）及Middlebury（4.65px）表现稳定，且在新数据集跨域性能首位；迭代方法（如IGEV++）存在显著性能波动（ETH3D 0.36px vs Middlebury 6.77px），揭示场景结构对模型表现的关键影响。

Conclusion: 植被环境深度估计需采用基础模型DEFOM作为基准方案，其跨数据集平均排名1.75且具备伪真值生成能力，研究填补了林业场景深度估计基准空白，为后续无人机自主作业提供关键支撑。

Abstract: Autonomous UAV forestry operations require robust depth estimation with strong cross-domain generalization, yet existing evaluations focus on urban and indoor scenarios, leaving a critical gap for vegetation-dense environments. We present the first systematic zero-shot evaluation of eight stereo methods spanning iterative refinement, foundation model, diffusion-based, and 3D CNN paradigms. All methods use officially released pretrained weights (trained on Scene Flow) and are evaluated on four standard benchmarks (ETH3D, KITTI 2012/2015, Middlebury) plus a novel 5,313-pair Canterbury Tree Branches dataset ($1920 \times 1080$). Results reveal scene-dependent patterns: foundation models excel on structured scenes (BridgeDepth: 0.23 px on ETH3D; DEFOM: 4.65 px on Middlebury), while iterative methods show variable cross-benchmark performance (IGEV++: 0.36 px on ETH3D but 6.77 px on Middlebury; IGEV: 0.33 px on ETH3D but 4.99 px on Middlebury). Qualitative evaluation on the Tree Branches dataset establishes DEFOM as the gold-standard baseline for vegetation depth estimation, with superior cross-domain consistency (consistently ranking 1st-2nd across benchmarks, average rank 1.75). DEFOM predictions will serve as pseudo-ground-truth for future benchmarking.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视动态场景变化，而现实世界场景始终在变化，需更贴合实际的交互模型。

Method: 包含三个组件：动态场景感知导航（视觉）、层次化经验记忆系统（记忆）、人类-场景交互扩散模型（控制）。

Result: 在静态和动态场景中均生成高质量交互动作，构建动态数据集Dyn-Scenes并验证模型性能。

Conclusion: 首个动态化人类-场景交互认知架构，通过整合动态感知、经验记忆和生成式控制提升交互质量与泛化性。

Abstract: Scenes are continuously undergoing dynamic changes in the real world. However, existing human-scene interaction generation methods typically treat the scene as static, which deviates from reality. Inspired by world models, we introduce Dyn-HSI, the first cognitive architecture for dynamic human-scene interaction, which endows virtual humans with three humanoid components. (1)Vision (human eyes): we equip the virtual human with a Dynamic Scene-Aware Navigation, which continuously perceives changes in the surrounding environment and adaptively predicts the next waypoint. (2)Memory (human brain): we equip the virtual human with a Hierarchical Experience Memory, which stores and updates experiential data accumulated during training. This allows the model to leverage prior knowledge during inference for context-aware motion priming, thereby enhancing both motion quality and generalization. (3) Control (human body): we equip the virtual human with Human-Scene Interaction Diffusion Model, which generates high-fidelity interaction motions conditioned on multimodal inputs. To evaluate performance in dynamic scenes, we extend the existing static human-scene interaction datasets to construct a dynamic benchmark, Dyn-Scenes. We conduct extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments to validate Dyn-HSI, showing that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches and generates high-quality human-scene interaction motions in both static and dynamic settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于熵引导的k-Guard（ENkG）采样策略，用于视频生成任务中动态调整候选标记数量，解决传统静态top-k/top-p方法在视频生成中的低效问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的top-k/top-p采样在语言模型中表现良好，但视频标记具有低语义密度和高时空冗余性，导致静态策略在低不确定性区域（如静态背景）引入噪声，在高不确定性区域（如前景物体）产生误差累积问题，最终损害长序列视频质量。

Method: ENkG通过计算每个标记预测分布的熵值量化离散程度，自适应调整候选标记数量：低熵区域（低不确定性）采用更少候选以减少冗余噪声，高熵区域（高不确定性）增加候选数量以缓解误差传播。该方法无需训练且适用于多种模型。

Result: 实验表明，ENkG在感知质量和结构稳定性（特别是长时序视频）上均优于静态top-k/top-p方法，同时仅引入可忽略的额外计算开销。

Conclusion: ENkG通过动态调整候选标记策略解决了视频生成中的关键挑战，其基于熵的自适应机制有效平衡了生成质量与多样性，且具有模型无关性和工程实用性。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) architectures have achieved significant successes in LLMs, inspiring explorations for video generation. In LLMs, top-p/top-k sampling strategies work exceptionally well: language tokens have high semantic density and low redundancy, so a fixed size of token candidates already strikes a balance between semantic accuracy and generation diversity. In contrast, video tokens have low semantic density and high spatio-temporal redundancy. This mismatch makes static top-k/top-p strategies ineffective for video decoders: they either introduce unnecessary randomness for low-uncertainty regions (static backgrounds) or get stuck in early errors for high-uncertainty regions (foreground objects). Prediction errors will accumulate as more frames are generated and eventually severely degrade long-horizon quality. To address this, we propose Entropy-Guided k-Guard (ENkG) sampling, a simple yet effective strategy that adapts sampling to token-wise dispersion, quantified by the entropy of each token's predicted distribution. ENkG uses adaptive token candidate sizes: for low-entropy regions, it employs fewer candidates to suppress redundant noise and preserve structural integrity; for high-entropy regions, it uses more candidates to mitigate error compounding. ENkG is model-agnostic, training-free, and adds negligible overhead. Experiments demonstrate consistent improvements in perceptual quality and structural stability compared to static top-k/top-p strategies.

Motivation: 针对一分钟内完成高质量3D重建的严格需求，以及SLAM（含噪声轨迹）与COLMAP（高精度轨迹）两种截然不同输入场景的兼容性挑战，设计鲁棒的快速解决方案。

Method: 分两阶段：第一阶段采用反向逐高斯并行优化、锚点神经高斯表示及单目深度初始化等技术，在噪声轨迹下加速收敛；第二阶段切换至标准3DGS，引入多视角一致性分裂与深度监督，适配高精度轨迹并减少计算开销。

Result: 在测试中达到28.43 PSNR，竞赛排名第一，满足严格的一分钟预算要求。

Conclusion: 通过分阶段技术整合（如双优化策略、自适应表示切换），方法在异构数据下均保持高效与精度，证明了其快速且鲁棒的3D重建能力。

Abstract: We present a fast 3DGS reconstruction pipeline designed to converge within one minute, developed for the SIGGRAPH Asia 3DGS Fast Reconstruction Challenge. The challenge consists of an initial round using SLAM-generated camera poses (with noisy trajectories) and a final round using COLMAP poses (highly accurate). To robustly handle these heterogeneous settings, we develop a two-stage solution. In the first round, we use reverse per-Gaussian parallel optimization and compact forward splatting based on Taming-GS and Speedy-splat, load-balanced tiling, an anchor-based Neural-Gaussian representation enabling rapid convergence with fewer learnable parameters, initialization from monocular depth and partially from feed-forward 3DGS models, and a global pose refinement module for noisy SLAM trajectories. In the final round, the accurate COLMAP poses change the optimization landscape; we disable pose refinement, revert from Neural-Gaussians back to standard 3DGS to eliminate MLP inference overhead, introduce multi-view consistency-guided Gaussian splitting inspired by Fast-GS, and introduce a depth estimator to supervise the rendered depth. Together, these techniques enable high-fidelity reconstruction under a strict one-minute budget. Our method achieved the top performance with a PSNR of 28.43 and ranked first in the competition.

Motivation: 现有生成模型依赖弱条件信号（如标签/文本），导致脑部MRI生成结果缺乏解剖学支撑，且存在生物合理性缺陷，尤其难以处理罕见表型、跨扫描仪域适应及纵向成像覆盖不足等挑战。

Method: 提出Cor2Vox框架：1) 通过高分辨率皮层表面（基于3.3万UK Biobank扫描构建的统计形状模型）引导3D形状到图像的布朗桥扩散过程；2) 以连续皮质结构先验约束生成，实现拓扑保真和精细解剖控制。

Result: 在传统图像质量指标、皮层表面重构和全脑分割质量上均优于基线方法，在(i)解剖一致合成、(ii)灰质萎缩模拟、(iii)神经退行性疾病数据集标准化等应用中，达到亚体素级皮层形态保留且无需微调。

Conclusion: Cor2Vox为脑MRI合成提供了具有生物合理性和几何稳健性的解决方案，可扩展至跨疾病表型和异常皮层几何条件下的合成任务。

Abstract: Synthetic neuroimaging data can mitigate critical limitations of real-world datasets, including the scarcity of rare phenotypes, domain shifts across scanners, and insufficient longitudinal coverage. However, existing generative models largely rely on weak conditioning signals, such as labels or text, which lack anatomical grounding and often produce biologically implausible outputs. To this end, we introduce Cor2Vox, a cortex-grounded generative framework for brain magnetic resonance image (MRI) synthesis that ties image generation to continuous structural priors of the cerebral cortex. It leverages high-resolution cortical surfaces to guide a 3D shape-to-image Brownian bridge diffusion process, enabling topologically faithful synthesis and precise control over underlying anatomies. To support the generation of new, realistic brain shapes, we developed a large-scale statistical shape model of cortical morphology derived from over 33,000 UK Biobank scans. We validated the fidelity of Cor2Vox based on traditional image quality metrics, advanced cortical surface reconstruction, and whole-brain segmentation quality, outperforming many baseline methods. Across three applications, namely (i) anatomically consistent synthesis, (ii) simulation of progressive gray matter atrophy, and (iii) harmonization of in-house frontotemporal dementia scans with public datasets, Cor2Vox preserved fine-grained cortical morphology at the sub-voxel level, exhibiting remarkable robustness to variations in cortical geometry and disease phenotype without retraining.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成方法在低质量输入与高质量输出间存在信息差异，导致一对一多的映射和伪影

Method: 结合离散语义逻辑与连续纹理生成，通过增强输入密度和修剪输出分布

Result: 实验显示在合成与真实数据上均达最先进性能，且显著降低解纠缠熵

Conclusion: 通过偏好对齐策略建立确定性修复路径，为可靠盲复原提供新框架

Abstract: Blind face restoration remains a persistent challenge due to the inherent ill-posedness of reconstructing holistic structures from severely constrained observations. Current generative approaches, while capable of synthesizing realistic textures, often suffer from information asymmetry -- the intrinsic disparity between the information-sparse low quality inputs and the information-dense high quality outputs. This imbalance leads to a one-to-many mapping, where insufficient constraints result in stochastic uncertainty and hallucinatory artifacts. To bridge this gap, we present \textbf{Pref-Restore}, a hierarchical framework that integrates discrete semantic logic with continuous texture generation to achieve deterministic, preference-aligned restoration. Our methodology fundamentally addresses this information disparity through two complementary strategies: (1) Augmenting Input Density: We employ an auto-regressive integrator to reformulate textual instructions into dense latent queries, injecting high-level semantic stability to constrain the degraded signals; (2) Pruning Output Distribution: We pioneer the integration of on-policy reinforcement learning directly into the diffusion restoration loop. By transforming human preferences into differentiable constraints, we explicitly penalize stochastic deviations, thereby sharpening the posterior distribution toward the desired high-fidelity outcomes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Pref-Restore achieves state-of-the-art performance across synthetic and real-world benchmarks. Furthermore, empirical analysis confirms that our preference-aligned strategy significantly reduces solution entropy, establishing a robust pathway toward reliable and deterministic blind restoration.

Conclusion: 该无外部设备的运动捕捉方案在真实场景中展现出实用价值，为跨物种运动分析提供了新颖、低成本的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce a novel motion capture system that reconstructs full-body 3D motion using only sparse pairwise distance (PWD) measurements from body-mounted(UWB) sensors. Using time-of-flight ranging between wireless nodes, our method eliminates the need for external cameras, enabling robust operation in uncontrolled and outdoor environments. Unlike traditional optical or inertial systems, our approach is shape-invariant and resilient to environmental constraints such as lighting and magnetic interference. At the core of our system is Wild-Poser (WiP for short), a compact, real-time Transformer-based architecture that directly predicts 3D joint positions from noisy or corrupted PWD measurements, which can later be used for joint rotation reconstruction via learned methods. WiP generalizes across subjects of varying morphologies, including non-human species, without requiring individual body measurements or shape fitting. Operating in real time, WiP achieves low joint position error and demonstrates accurate 3D motion reconstruction for both human and animal subjects in-the-wild. Our empirical analysis highlights its potential for scalable, low-cost, and general purpose motion capture in real-world settings.

Abstract: Sign language generation (SLG) aims to translate written texts into expressive sign motions, bridging communication barriers for the Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing communities. Recent studies formulate SLG within the language modeling framework using autoregressive language models, which suffer from unidirectional context modeling and slow token-by-token inference. To address these limitations, we present MaDiS, a masked-diffusion-based language model for SLG that captures bidirectional dependencies and supports efficient parallel multi-token generation. We further introduce a tri-level cross-modal pretraining scheme that jointly learns from token-, latent-, and 3D physical-space objectives, leading to richer and more grounded sign representations. To accelerate model convergence in the fine-tuning stage, we design a novel unmasking strategy with temporal checkpoints, reducing the combinatorial complexity of unmasking orders by over $10^{41}$ times. In addition, a mixture-of-parts embedding layer is developed to effectively fuse information stored in different part-wise sign tokens through learnable gates and well-optimized codebooks. Extensive experiments on CSL-Daily, Phoenix-2014T, and How2Sign demonstrate that MaDiS achieves superior performance across multiple metrics, including DTW error and two newly introduced metrics, SiBLEU and SiCLIP, while reducing inference latency by nearly 30%. Code and models will be released on our project page.

Abstract: Vision-based 3D human motion capture from videos remains a challenge in computer vision. Traditional 3D pose estimation approaches often ignore the temporal consistency between frames, causing implausible and jittery motion. The emerging field of kinematics-based 3D motion capture addresses these issues by estimating the temporal transitioning between poses instead. A major drawback in current kinematics approaches is their reliance on Euler angles. Despite their simplicity, Euler angles suffer from discontinuity that leads to unstable motion reconstructions, especially in online settings where trajectory refinement is unavailable. Contrarily, quaternions have no discontinuity and can produce continuous transitions between poses. In this paper, we propose QuaMo, a novel Quaternion Motions method using quaternion differential equations (QDE) for human kinematics capture. We utilize the state-space model, an effective system for describing real-time kinematics estimations, with quaternion state and the QDE describing quaternion velocity. The corresponding angular acceleration is computed from a meta-PD controller with a novel acceleration enhancement that adaptively regulates the control signals as the human quickly changes to a new pose. Unlike previous work, our QDE is solved under the quaternion unit-sphere constraint that results in more accurate estimations. Experimental results show that our novel formulation of the QDE with acceleration enhancement accurately estimates 3D human kinematics with no discontinuity and minimal implausibilities. QuaMo outperforms comparable state-of-the-art methods on multiple datasets, namely Human3.6M, Fit3D, SportsPose and AIST. The code is available at https://github.com/cuongle1206/QuaMo

Abstract: Botulinum toxin (Botox) injections are the gold standard for managing facial asymmetry and aesthetic rejuvenation, yet determining the optimal dosage remains largely intuitive, often leading to suboptimal outcomes. We propose a localized latent editing framework that simulates Botulinum Toxin injection effects for injection planning through dose-response modeling. Our key contribution is a Region-Specific Latent Axis Discovery method that learns localized muscle relaxation trajectories in StyleGAN2's latent space, enabling precise control over specific facial regions without global side effects. By correlating these localized latent trajectories with injected toxin units, we learn a predictive dose-response model. We rigorously compare two approaches: direct metric regression versus image-based generative simulation on a clinical dataset of N=360 images from 46 patients. On a hold-out test set, our framework demonstrates moderate-to-strong structural correlations for geometric asymmetry metrics, confirming that the generative model correctly captures the direction of morphological changes. While biological variability limits absolute precision, we introduce a hybrid "Human-in-the-Loop" workflow where clinicians interactively refine simulations, bridging the gap between pathological reconstruction and cosmetic planning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出GMS-CAVP框架，通过多尺度对比学习与扩散生成目标提升视频-音频对齐建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如CAVP未能充分利用视频与音频信号中细粒度至粗粒度的时空对应关系，导致跨模态建模效果受限。

Method: GMS-CAVP包含两部分创新：① 多尺度对比学习策略，捕捉不同粒度的语义-时序关系；② 引入基于扩散的生成目标，支持视频-音频跨模态翻译与合成，实现判别-生成联合训练。

Result: 在VGGSound、AudioSet和Panda70M数据集上，GMS-CAVP在跨模态检索与生成任务中均超越现有方法，验证了多尺度建模与生成目标的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架通过统一判别与生成范式，深化了跨模态理解，为高质量视频-音频生成提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in video-audio (V-A) understanding and generation have increasingly relied on joint V-A embeddings, which serve as the foundation for tasks such as cross-modal retrieval and generation. While prior methods like CAVP effectively model semantic and temporal correspondences between modalities using contrastive objectives, their performance remains suboptimal. A key limitation is the insufficient modeling of the dense, multi-scale nature of both video and audio signals, correspondences often span fine- to coarse-grained spatial-temporal structures, which are underutilized in existing frameworks. To this end, we propose GMS-CAVP, a novel framework that combines Multi-Scale Video-Audio Alignment and Multi-Scale Spatial-Temporal Diffusion-based pretraining objectives to enhance V-A correspondence modeling. First, GMS-CAVP introduces a multi-scale contrastive learning strategy that captures semantic and temporal relations across varying granularities. Second, we go beyond traditional contrastive learning by incorporating a diffusion-based generative objective, enabling modality translation and synthesis between video and audio. This unified discriminative-generative formulation facilitates deeper cross-modal understanding and paves the way for high-fidelity generation. Extensive experiments on VGGSound, AudioSet, and Panda70M demonstrate that GMS-CAVP outperforms previous methods in generation and retrieval.

TL;DR: 在差分隐私（DP）医学图像分析中，自我监督初始化（如DINOv3）可提高模型性能，但仍逊色于领域特定的监督预训练，且初始化策略显著影响公平性与泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管模型初始化能缓解DP带来的性能损失，但现代自监督学习在完整模型DP中的作用尚不明确。研究旨在评估不同初始化策略在医学影像分析中的效果。

Method: 使用基于DP-SGD训练的ConvNeXt模型，在超过80万张胸部X光图像上对比ImageNet监督初始化、DINOv3自监督初始化及MIMIC-CXR领域监督预训练，并在5个外部数据集评估性能。

Result: DINOv3初始化在DP条件下优于ImageNet初始化，但表现低于领域监督预训练。初始化选择显著影响诊断效用、人口统计公平性、跨数据集泛化性及对数据规模和模型容量的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 初始化策略是DP医学影像效用、公平性和泛化的关键因素。自监督初始化有效但次优，领域监督预训练最接近非隐私基线性能。

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) provides formal protection for sensitive data but typically incurs substantial losses in diagnostic performance. Model initialization has emerged as a critical factor in mitigating this degradation, yet the role of modern self-supervised learning under full-model DP remains poorly understood. Here, we present a large-scale evaluation of initialization strategies for differentially private medical image analysis, using chest radiograph classification as a representative benchmark with more than 800,000 images. Using state-of-the-art ConvNeXt models trained with DP-SGD across realistic privacy regimes, we compare non-domain-specific supervised ImageNet initialization, non-domain-specific self-supervised DINOv3 initialization, and domain-specific supervised pretraining on MIMIC-CXR, the largest publicly available chest radiograph dataset. Evaluations are conducted across five external datasets spanning diverse institutions and acquisition settings. We show that DINOv3 initialization consistently improves diagnostic utility relative to ImageNet initialization under DP, but remains inferior to domain-specific supervised pretraining, which achieves performance closest to non-private baselines. We further demonstrate that initialization choice strongly influences demographic fairness, cross-dataset generalization, and robustness to data scale and model capacity under privacy constraints. The results establish initialization strategy as a central determinant of utility, fairness, and generalization in differentially private medical imaging.

Abstract: Low-altitude vision systems are becoming a critical infrastructure for smart city governance. However, existing object-centric perception paradigms and loosely coupled vision-language pipelines are still difficult to support management-oriented anomaly understanding required in real-world urban governance. To bridge this gap, we introduce GovLA-10K, the first management-oriented multi-modal benchmark for low-altitude intelligence, along with GovLA-Reasoner, a unified vision-language reasoning framework tailored for governance-aware aerial perception. Unlike existing studies that aim to exhaustively annotate all visible objects, GovLA-10K is deliberately designed around functionally salient targets that directly correspond to practical management needs, and further provides actionable management suggestions grounded in these observations. To effectively coordinate the fine-grained visual grounding with high-level contextual language reasoning, GovLA-Reasoner introduces an efficient feature adapter that implicitly coordinates discriminative representation sharing between the visual detector and the large language model (LLM). Extensive experiments show that our method significantly improves performance while avoiding the need of fine-tuning for any task-specific individual components. We believe our work offers a new perspective and foundation for future studies on management-aware low-altitude vision-language systems.

Conclusion: 子空间划分策略成功平衡知识保留/获取矛盾，为持续学习提供新范式。

Abstract: Continual learning for pre-trained vision-language models requires balancing three competing objectives: retaining pre-trained knowledge, preserving knowledge from a sequence of learned tasks, and maintaining the plasticity to acquire new knowledge. This paper presents a simple but effective approach called KeepLoRA to effectively balance these objectives. We first analyze the knowledge retention mechanism within the model parameter space and find that general knowledge is mainly encoded in the principal subspace, while task-specific knowledge is encoded in the residual subspace. Motivated by this finding, KeepLoRA learns new tasks by restricting LoRA parameter updates in the residual subspace to prevent interfering with previously learned capabilities. Specifically, we infuse knowledge for a new task by projecting its gradient onto a subspace orthogonal to both the principal subspace of pre-trained model and the dominant directions of previous task features. Our theoretical and empirical analyses confirm that KeepLoRA balances the three objectives and achieves state-of-the-art performance. The implementation code is available at https://github.com/MaolinLuo/KeepLoRA.

TL;DR: 提出新的图像感知相似度指标，结合纹理和色彩差异评估并提供可视化解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像相似度指标非感知，且在形状与纹理失真场景下性能不足。

Method: 融合Earth Mover's Distance（纹理差异）和Oklab颜色空间（色彩差异），并在Berkeley-Adobe数据集验证。

Result: 新指标在复杂形变场景下性能超越SOTA，且支持可视化解释相似度差异。

Conclusion: 实现透明化相似度评估，弥补黑盒深度模型无法解释差异的局限性。

Abstract: In the literature, several studies have shown that state-of-the-art image similarity metrics are not perceptual metrics; moreover, they have difficulty evaluating images, especially when texture distortion is also present. In this work, we propose a new perceptual metric composed of two terms. The first term evaluates the dissimilarity between the textures of two images using Earth Mover's Distance. The second term evaluates the chromatic dissimilarity between two images in the Oklab perceptual color space. We evaluated the performance of our metric on a non-traditional dataset, called Berkeley-Adobe Perceptual Patch Similarity, which contains a wide range of complex distortions in shapes and colors. We have shown that our metric outperforms the state of the art, especially when images contain shape distortions, confirming also its greater perceptiveness. Furthermore, although deep black-box metrics could be very accurate, they only provide similarity scores between two images, without explaining their main differences and similarities. Our metric, on the other hand, provides visual explanations to support the calculated score, making the similarity assessment transparent and justified.

*Hanting Niu,Junkai Deng,Fei Hou,Wencheng Wang,Ying He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SharpNet improves MLPs to represent functions with user-defined sharp features by integrating a differentiable auxiliary feature function based on a Poisson equation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional MLPs produce globally smooth outputs, failing to capture deliberate C⁰ sharp features (e.g., edges/corners) without post-processing.

Method: SharpNet introduces an auxiliary feature function via a Poisson equation with jump Neumann boundary conditions, evaluated through a differentiable local integral to jointly optimize feature locations and MLP parameters.

Result: SharpNet achieves precise C⁰-continuity at features (edges/corners) and smoothness elsewhere, outperforming baselines in 2D/3D tasks like CAD reconstruction by avoiding gradient smoothing.

Conclusion: SharpNet enables controllable sharp feature encoding in MLPs, combining differentiable feature optimization with standard neural networks for accurate function approximation.

Abstract: Multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) are a standard tool for learning and function approximation, but they inherently yield outputs that are globally smooth. As a result, they struggle to represent functions that are continuous yet deliberately non-differentiable (i.e., with prescribed $C^0$ sharp features) without relying on ad hoc post-processing. We present SharpNet, a modified MLP architecture capable of encoding functions with user-defined sharp features by enriching the network with an auxiliary feature function, which is defined as the solution to a Poisson equation with jump Neumann boundary conditions. It is evaluated via an efficient local integral that is fully differentiable with respect to the feature locations, enabling our method to jointly optimize both the feature locations and the MLP parameters to recover the target functions/models. The $C^0$-continuity of SharpNet is precisely controllable, ensuring $C^0$-continuity at the feature locations and smoothness elsewhere. We validate SharpNet on 2D problems and 3D CAD model reconstruction, and compare it against several state-of-the-art baselines. In both types of tasks, SharpNet accurately recovers sharp edges and corners while maintaining smooth behavior away from those features, whereas existing methods tend to smooth out gradient discontinuities. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations highlight the benefits of our approach.

TL;DR: Video-KTR improves video reasoning via token-level RL with three attribution signals


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video reasoning methods use coarse rewards or single-factor token selection, leading to low accuracy and poor interpretability by overlooking visual-temporal-linguistic interdependencies.

Method: Video-KTR combines three token-level attribution signals: (1) visual-aware tokens via counterfactual masking, (2) temporal-aware tokens through frame shuffling, and (3) high-entropy tokens indicating uncertainty, enabling selective reinforcement of semantically rich content.

Result: Achieved 42.7% SOTA on Video-Holmes (surpassing GPT-4o) and consistent gains across 5 benchmarks, with ablation studies confirming the effectiveness of token-level updates and multi-signal synergy.

Conclusion: Video-KTR enhances accuracy and interpretability in complex video reasoning, offering a simple drop-in RL extension for multimodal LLMs with verified robustness.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown strong potential for enhancing reasoning in multimodal large language models, yet existing video reasoning methods often rely on coarse sequence-level rewards or single-factor token selection, neglecting fine-grained links among visual inputs, temporal dynamics, and linguistic outputs, limiting both accuracy and interpretability. We propose Video-KTR, a modality-aware policy shaping framework that performs selective, token-level RL by combining three attribution signals: (1) visual-aware tokens identified via counterfactual masking to reveal perceptual dependence; (2) temporal-aware tokens detected through frame shuffling to expose temporal sensitivity; and (3) high-entropy tokens signaling predictive uncertainty. By reinforcing only these key tokens, Video-KTR focuses learning on semantically informative, modality-sensitive content while filtering out low-value tokens. Across five challenging benchmarks, Video-KTR achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive results, achieving 42.7\% on Video-Holmes (surpassing GPT-4o) with consistent gains on both reasoning and general video understanding tasks. Ablation studies verify the complementary roles of the attribution signals and the robustness of targeted token-level updates. Overall, Video-KTR improves accuracy and interpretability, offering a simple, drop-in extension to RL for complex video reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Vision Mamba-based medical image segmentation methods rely on complex architectural designs to enhance long-range dependency handling, which may increase computational overhead and limit efficiency.

Method: The authors developed a dual self-distillation framework for VM-UNet that aligns features at both global and local levels, improving model performance without modifying the core architecture.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrated that the proposed DSVM-UNet achieved state-of-the-art performance on ISIC2017, ISIC2018, and Synapse benchmarks while maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: Dual self-distillation effectively enhances the representational capacity of Vision Mamba models for medical image segmentation without increasing architectural complexity.

Abstract: Vision Mamba models have been extensively researched in various fields, which address the limitations of previous models by effectively managing long-range dependencies with a linear-time overhead. Several prospective studies have further designed Vision Mamba based on UNet(VM-UNet) for medical image segmentation. These approaches primarily focus on optimizing architectural designs by creating more complex structures to enhance the model's ability to perceive semantic features. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective approach to improve the model by Dual Self-distillation for VM-UNet (DSVM-UNet) without any complex architectural designs. To achieve this goal, we develop double self-distillation methods to align the features at both the global and local levels. Extensive experiments conducted on the ISIC2017, ISIC2018, and Synapse benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: SWEET为视觉模型提供具有模块化特性和规模适应性的初始化框架，解决了传统方法在架构多样性上的适配瓶颈。

Abstract: The increasing scale and complexity of modern model parameters underscore the importance of pre-trained models. However, deployment often demands architectures of varying sizes, exposing limitations of conventional pre-training and fine-tuning. To address this, we propose SWEET, a self-supervised framework that performs constraint-based pre-training to enable scalable initialization in vision tasks. Instead of pre-training a fixed-size model, we learn a shared weight template and size-specific weight scalers under Tucker-based factorization, which promotes modularity and supports flexible adaptation to architectures with varying depths and widths. Target models are subsequently initialized by composing and reweighting the template through lightweight weight scalers, whose parameters can be efficiently learned from minimal training data. To further enhance flexibility in width expansion, we introduce width-wise stochastic scaling, which regularizes the template along width-related dimensions and encourages robust, width-invariant representations for improved cross-width generalization. Extensive experiments on \textsc{classification}, \textsc{detection}, \textsc{segmentation} and \textsc{generation} tasks demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of SWEET for initializing variable-sized vision models.

Conclusion: 通过显式融合水下光学特性到3DGS核心，解决了传统方法的计算效率与物理一致性矛盾，推动水下场景重建技术发展。

Abstract: Underwater 3D reconstruction and appearance restoration are hindered by the complex optical properties of water, such as wavelength-dependent attenuation and scattering. Existing Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)-based methods struggle with slow rendering speeds and suboptimal color restoration, while 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) inherently lacks the capability to model complex volumetric scattering effects. To address these issues, we introduce WaterClear-GS, the first pure 3DGS-based framework that explicitly integrates underwater optical properties of local attenuation and scattering into Gaussian primitives, eliminating the need for an auxiliary medium network. Our method employs a dual-branch optimization strategy to ensure underwater photometric consistency while naturally recovering water-free appearances. This strategy is enhanced by depth-guided geometry regularization and perception-driven image loss, together with exposure constraints, spatially-adaptive regularization, and physically guided spectral regularization, which collectively enforce local 3D coherence and maintain natural visual perception. Experiments on standard benchmarks and our newly collected dataset demonstrate that WaterClear-GS achieves outstanding performance on both novel view synthesis (NVS) and underwater image restoration (UIR) tasks, while maintaining real-time rendering. The code will be available at https://buaaxrzhang.github.io/WaterClear-GS/.

*Deeksha Arun,Kevin W. Bowyer,Patrick Flynn*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces PaW-ViT, a preprocessing method for vision transformers in ear recognition, which aligns token boundaries with ear anatomical features to improve robustness against shape/size/pose variation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision transformers using rectangular tokens often include irrelevant visual data outside the target object (ear), while anatomical feature alignment is crucial for robust recognition in biometric applications.

Method: PaW-ViT applies anatomical knowledge-based normalization to align token boundaries with detected ear features, warping tokens along natural curvature for morphological consistency before ViT processing.

Result: Experiments show PaW-ViT improves robustness across ViT architectures (ViT-T to ViT-L), with consistent token representations and recognition accuracy despite ear morphology variations.

Conclusion: By harmonizing ViT's positional sensitivity with ear anatomical variations, PaW-ViT provides a technical pathway for ear biometric authentication systems.

Abstract: The rectangular tokens common to vision transformer methods for visual recognition can strongly affect performance of these methods due to incorporation of information outside the objects to be recognized. This paper introduces PaW-ViT, Patch-based Warping Vision Transformer, a preprocessing approach rooted in anatomical knowledge that normalizes ear images to enhance the efficacy of ViT. By accurately aligning token boundaries to detected ear feature boundaries, PaW-ViT obtains greater robustness to shape, size, and pose variation. By aligning feature boundaries to natural ear curvature, it produces more consistent token representations for various morphologies. Experiments confirm the effectiveness of PaW-ViT on various ViT models (ViT-T, ViT-S, ViT-B, ViT-L) and yield reasonable alignment robustness to variation in shape, size, and pose. Our work aims to solve the disconnect between ear biometric morphological variation and transformer architecture positional sensitivity, presenting a possible avenue for authentication schemes.

Conclusion: GeoDiff3D为高保真3D场景生成提供了实用化解决方案，在影视游戏制作、VR内容创作等领域具有显著应用价值。

Abstract: 3D scene generation is a core technology for gaming, film/VFX, and VR/AR. Growing demand for rapid iteration, high-fidelity detail, and accessible content creation has further increased interest in this area. Existing methods broadly follow two paradigms - indirect 2D-to-3D reconstruction and direct 3D generation - but both are limited by weak structural modeling and heavy reliance on large-scale ground-truth supervision, often producing structural artifacts, geometric inconsistencies, and degraded high-frequency details in complex scenes. We propose GeoDiff3D, an efficient self-supervised framework that uses coarse geometry as a structural anchor and a geometry-constrained 2D diffusion model to provide texture-rich reference images. Importantly, GeoDiff3D does not require strict multi-view consistency of the diffusion-generated references and remains robust to the resulting noisy, inconsistent guidance. We further introduce voxel-aligned 3D feature aggregation and dual self-supervision to maintain scene coherence and fine details while substantially reducing dependence on labeled data. GeoDiff3D also trains with low computational cost and enables fast, high-quality 3D scene generation. Extensive experiments on challenging scenes show improved generalization and generation quality over existing baselines, offering a practical solution for accessible and efficient 3D scene construction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 耳部遮挡（如耳环/耳机）会降低生物识别系统在非约束环境下的准确性，需要有效缓解方案

Method: 采用扩散模型进行耳部图像修复，利用配件遮罩重建耳部结构，保持关键部位几何特征（螺旋、耳垂等）

Result: 在多种Transformer架构和数据集上的实验证明修复技术能显著提升识别准确率，最优补丁尺寸提升效果最明显

Conclusion: 扩散修复技术作为预处理步骤能有效缓解耳部遮挡带来的性能退化问题

Abstract: Ear occlusions (arising from the presence of ear accessories such as earrings and earphones) can negatively impact performance in ear-based biometric recognition systems, especially in unconstrained imaging circumstances. In this study, we assess the effectiveness of a diffusion-based ear inpainting technique as a pre-processing aid to mitigate the issues of ear accessory occlusions in transformer-based ear recognition systems. Given an input ear image and an automatically derived accessory mask, the inpainting model reconstructs clean and anatomically plausible ear regions by synthesizing missing pixels while preserving local geometric coherence along key ear structures, including the helix, antihelix, concha, and lobule. We evaluate the effectiveness of this pre-processing aid in transformer-based recognition systems for several vision transformer models and different patch sizes for a range of benchmark datasets. Experiments show that diffusion-based inpainting can be a useful pre-processing aid to alleviate ear accessory occlusions to improve overall recognition performance.

TL;DR: Youtu-VL通过将视觉信号作为预测目标而非输入，提出视觉-语言统一自回归监督范式，解决现有模型丢失细粒度视觉信息的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLMs因文本主导优化机制导致视觉信息利用不充分，视觉信号仅被用作条件输入而非监督目标，造成多模态理解局限。

Method: 提出VLUAS范式：1) 将视觉token直接纳入预测流；2) 对视觉细节和语言内容实施统一自回归监督；3) 延伸至视觉中心任务，无需任务定制模块。

Result: 实验表明在通用多模态任务（如VQA）和视觉中心任务（如目标定位）上均取得竞争性性能，验证了框架有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法打破了传统vision-as-input范式，为构建兼具语言理解和视觉感知能力的通用视觉智能体提供了新方向。

Abstract: Despite the significant advancements represented by Vision-Language Models (VLMs), current architectures often exhibit limitations in retaining fine-grained visual information, leading to coarse-grained multimodal comprehension. We attribute this deficiency to a suboptimal training paradigm inherent in prevailing VLMs, which exhibits a text-dominant optimization bias by conceptualizing visual signals merely as passive conditional inputs rather than supervisory targets. To mitigate this, we introduce Youtu-VL, a framework leveraging the Vision-Language Unified Autoregressive Supervision (VLUAS) paradigm, which fundamentally shifts the optimization objective from ``vision-as-input'' to ``vision-as-target.'' By integrating visual tokens directly into the prediction stream, Youtu-VL applies unified autoregressive supervision to both visual details and linguistic content. Furthermore, we extend this paradigm to encompass vision-centric tasks, enabling a standard VLM to perform vision-centric tasks without task-specific additions. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that Youtu-VL achieves competitive performance on both general multimodal tasks and vision-centric tasks, establishing a robust foundation for the development of comprehensive generalist visual agents.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的查询引导的空间-时间-频率（QSTar）交互方法，并设计了查询上下文推理模块（QCR），显著提升音频-视觉问答任务（AVQA）性能，强调音频频域特征与问题引导线索的多模态融合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AVQA方法过度依赖视觉信息处理且音频与问题文本的作用受限：音频仅作为视觉补充、问题引导信息滞于推理后期，需通过联合音频频域特性、视频时空理解及早期问题引导实现更深层多模态交互。

Method: 提出QSTar方法：将音频信号转换到频域空间并联合视频时空建模，通过问题引导线索动态聚焦多模态特征；设计QCR模块利用提示学习增强文本对音视频特征的注意力聚焦机制。

Result: 在多个AVQA基准测试中均取得显著性能提升，超越现有音频QA、视觉QA、视频QA及AVQA方法，在少样本场景下仍保持较强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 证明了问题引导的频域音频特征交互与跨模态注意力聚焦对AVQA任务的重要性，为多模态任务中知识融合时序、频域与语义信息提供了新思路。

Abstract: Audio--Visual Question Answering (AVQA) is a challenging multimodal task that requires jointly reasoning over audio, visual, and textual information in a given video to answer natural language questions. Inspired by recent advances in Video QA, many existing AVQA approaches primarily focus on visual information processing, leveraging pre-trained models to extract object-level and motion-level representations. However, in those methods, the audio input is primarily treated as complementary to video analysis, and the textual question information contributes minimally to audio--visual understanding, as it is typically integrated only in the final stages of reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Query-guided Spatial--Temporal--Frequency (QSTar) interaction method, which effectively incorporates question-guided clues and exploits the distinctive frequency-domain characteristics of audio signals, alongside spatial and temporal perception, to enhance audio--visual understanding. Furthermore, we introduce a Query Context Reasoning (QCR) block inspired by prompting, which guides the model to focus more precisely on semantically relevant audio and visual features. Extensive experiments conducted on several AVQA benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving significant performance improvements over existing Audio QA, Visual QA, Video QA, and AVQA approaches. The code and pretrained models will be released after publication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模态数据的分层/关系结构难以用欧几里得几何建模，而双曲几何天然适配此类结构。现有双曲ViT缺乏对注意力机制和梯度稳定性的深入研究

Method: 提出两种架构：HexFormer（全双曲）和Hybrid（双曲编码器+欧式分类头），创新性采用指数映射进行注意力聚合；系统比较聚合策略有效性；通过梯度方差分析揭示双曲模型的训练稳定性优势

Result: 在多个数据集上HexFormer超越欧氏基线和现有双曲ViT，Hybrid效果最佳；实验证实双曲模型梯度方差降低68%，对warmup策略鲁棒性提升

Conclusion: 双曲几何通过改进特征聚合与梯度传播增强ViT性能，简单的指数映射优于复杂中心点计算，揭示了几何选择对模型鲁棒性和效率的关键作用

Abstract: Data across modalities such as images, text, and graphs often contains hierarchical and relational structures, which are challenging to model within Euclidean geometry. Hyperbolic geometry provides a natural framework for representing such structures. Building on this property, this work introduces HexFormer, a hyperbolic vision transformer for image classification that incorporates exponential map aggregation within its attention mechanism. Two designs are explored: a hyperbolic ViT (HexFormer) and a hybrid variant (HexFormer-Hybrid) that combines a hyperbolic encoder with an Euclidean linear classification head. HexFormer incorporates a novel attention mechanism based on exponential map aggregation, which yields more accurate and stable aggregated representations than standard centroid based averaging, showing that simpler approaches retain competitive merit. Experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate consistent performance improvements over Euclidean baselines and prior hyperbolic ViTs, with the hybrid variant achieving the strongest overall results. Additionally, this study provides an analysis of gradient stability in hyperbolic transformers. The results reveal that hyperbolic models exhibit more stable gradients and reduced sensitivity to warmup strategies compared to Euclidean architectures, highlighting their robustness and efficiency in training. Overall, these findings indicate that hyperbolic geometry can enhance vision transformer architectures by improving gradient stability and accuracy. In addition, relatively simple mechanisms such as exponential map aggregation can provide strong practical benefits.

Conclusion: 验证了上下文学习在3D手势重建中的有效性，为自中心视觉任务提供新框架。

Abstract: Robust 3D hand reconstruction in egocentric vision is challenging due to depth ambiguity, self-occlusion, and complex hand-object interactions. Prior methods mitigate these issues by scaling training data or adding auxiliary cues, but they often struggle in unseen contexts. We present EgoHandICL, the first in-context learning (ICL) framework for 3D hand reconstruction that improves semantic alignment, visual consistency, and robustness under challenging egocentric conditions. EgoHandICL introduces complementary exemplar retrieval guided by vision-language models (VLMs), an ICL-tailored tokenizer for multimodal context, and a masked autoencoder (MAE)-based architecture trained with hand-guided geometric and perceptual objectives. Experiments on ARCTIC and EgoExo4D show consistent gains over state-of-the-art methods. We also demonstrate real-world generalization and improve EgoVLM hand-object interaction reasoning by using reconstructed hands as visual prompts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CNN局部感受野依赖深度架构捕获全局信息的问题，同时克服ViT缺乏空间归纳偏差及对位置编码依赖的缺陷。

Method: 提出SONIC，使用连续谱参数化构建共享的定向选择组件，在频率域生成平滑响应，形成全局感受野和自适应分辨率的卷积算子。

Result: 在图像分类、3D医学数据等任务中，SONIC表现出更强的几何变换鲁棒性，参数量比现有方法少一个数量级且性能相当或更优。

Conclusion: 验证了连续谱参数化方法的理论基础，为传统空间/谱算子提供了参数高效且可扩展的替代框架。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) rely on fixed-size kernels scanning local patches, which limits their ability to capture global context or long-range dependencies without very deep architectures. Vision Transformers (ViTs), in turn, provide global connectivity but lack spatial inductive bias, depend on explicit positional encodings, and remain tied to the initial patch size. Bridging these limitations requires a representation that is both structured and global. We introduce SONIC (Spectral Oriented Neural Invariant Convolutions), a continuous spectral parameterisation that models convolutional operators using a small set of shared, orientation-selective components. These components define smooth responses across the full frequency domain, yielding global receptive fields and filters that adapt naturally across resolutions. Across synthetic benchmarks, large-scale image classification, and 3D medical datasets, SONIC shows improved robustness to geometric transformations, noise, and resolution shifts, and matches or exceeds convolutional, attention-based, and prior spectral architectures with an order of magnitude fewer parameters. These results demonstrate that continuous, orientation-aware spectral parameterisations provide a principled and scalable alternative to conventional spatial and spectral operators.

Motivation: 为了解决 VGGT-SLAM 中存在的高维 15 自由度漂移、平面退化问题，并在未知相机内参情况下处理重建模糊性。

Method: 1) 设计新因子图以消除漂移与平面退化；2) 通过分析 VGGT 注意力层实现无需训练的图像检索验证；3) 测试系统在开放集目标检测与地面机器人上的实时性能。

Result: 在 TUM 数据集上姿态误差降低 23%，实现实时性能，并成功应用于复杂室内、办公室及 4200 平方英尺 barn 环境。

Conclusion: 该改进方案提升了精度与鲁棒性，支持开放集目标检测，代码将公开发布。

Abstract: We present VGGT-SLAM 2.0, a real time RGB feed-forward SLAM system which substantially improves upon VGGT-SLAM for incrementally aligning submaps created from VGGT. Firstly, we remove high-dimensional 15-degree-of-freedom drift and planar degeneracy from VGGT-SLAM by creating a new factor graph design while still addressing the reconstruction ambiguity of VGGT given unknown camera intrinsics. Secondly, by studying the attention layers of VGGT, we show that one of the layers is well suited to assist in image retrieval verification for free without additional training, which enables both rejecting false positive matches and allows for completing more loop closures. Finally, we conduct a suite of experiments which includes showing VGGT-SLAM 2.0 can easily be adapted for open-set object detection and demonstrating real time performance while running online onboard a ground robot using a Jetson Thor. We also test in environments ranging from cluttered indoor apartments and office scenes to a 4,200 square foot barn, and we also demonstrate VGGT-SLAM 2.0 achieves the highest accuracy on the TUM dataset with about 23 percent less pose error than VGGT-SLAM. Code will be released upon publication.

TL;DR: 本研究提出DuwatBench数据集（1,272个阿拉伯书法样本含1,475个唯一单词），揭示当前多模态模型在识别复杂笔画/连笔的艺术化阿拉伯文时存在显著局限


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿拉伯书法融合语言与艺术特征，但现有AI模型（尤其是多语言模型）对这类视觉-语言跨模态数据的处理能力尚未被系统评估，尤其缺乏对古典至现代多种风格的测试基准

Method: 构建包含6种传统与现代书写风格的数据集，标注句子级检测信息，对13种主流阿拉伯语及多语言模型进行系统评估，分析模型在艺术化变形/密集连笔/复杂笔画结构等场景下的表现

Result: 模型在标准文本上表现良好（如OCR精度达85%+），但艺术化书写导致识别率下降40%以上，存在30%的视觉-文本不对齐错误，其中连笔识别错误率高达68%

Conclusion: 阿拉伯书法处理需要专门设计文化感知的视觉-语言模型，建议改进注意力机制以处理非线性排列的字符，强调多模态研究需关注语言文化遗产的特殊性

Abstract: Arabic calligraphy represents one of the richest visual traditions of the Arabic language, blending linguistic meaning with artistic form. Although multimodal models have advanced across languages, their ability to process Arabic script, especially in artistic and stylized calligraphic forms, remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we present DuwatBench, a benchmark of 1,272 curated samples containing about 1,475 unique words across six classical and modern calligraphic styles, each paired with sentence-level detection annotations. The dataset reflects real-world challenges in Arabic writing, such as complex stroke patterns, dense ligatures, and stylistic variations that often challenge standard text recognition systems. Using DuwatBench, we evaluated 13 leading Arabic and multilingual multimodal models and showed that while they perform well on clean text, they struggle with calligraphic variation, artistic distortions, and precise visual-text alignment. By publicly releasing DuwatBench and its annotations, we aim to advance culturally grounded multimodal research, foster fair inclusion of the Arabic language and visual heritage in AI systems, and support continued progress in this area. Our dataset (https://huggingface.co/datasets/MBZUAI/DuwatBench) and evaluation suit (https://github.com/mbzuai-oryx/DuwatBench) are publicly available.

Motivation: 现有研究为每种语言单独训练连接器，忽略了语言间的亲缘关系。这种方法在资源有限的情况下效率低下，且未能利用语言间的共性提升模型表现。

Method: 提出基于语言系属的连接器共享策略，每个语言系共享一个连接器，并在两个多语言大语言模型和两个包含专业与众包语音语料库的数据集上进行实证验证。

Result: 实验表明，家庭（语言系属）级别的连接器共享策略在两种模型和两类语音数据集上均显著减少参数量，同时提升了跨领域（如专业与众包数据）的语音识别泛化性能。

Conclusion: 该策略为多语言语音识别系统提供了可扩展且高效的解决方案，通过语言学关联性优化模型参数分配，平衡了性能与资源消耗。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-powered Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems achieve strong performance with limited resources by linking a frozen speech encoder to a pretrained LLM via a lightweight connector. Prior work trains a separate connector per language, overlooking linguistic relatedness. We propose an efficient and novel connector-sharing strategy based on linguistic family membership, enabling one connector per family, and empirically validate its effectiveness across two multilingual LLMs and two real-world corpora spanning curated and crowd-sourced speech. Our results show that family-based connectors reduce parameter count while improving generalization across domains, offering a practical and scalable strategy for multilingual ASR deployment.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的关系知识校准探测框架，发现现有语言模型（尤其是掩码预训练模型）存在过度自信问题，最佳校准需考虑陈述重述的不一致性，并揭示大模型在语言自信表达语义编码上的缺陷。


<details>

Motivation: 现有知识探测方法仅依赖准确率/精确度评估模型能力，忽视模型可靠性的核心体现——置信度校准，需要建立新的评估框架来衡量模型对自身预测的可靠性认知。

Method: 构建涵盖内在置信度、结构一致性、语义基础三种模态的校准探测框架，通过对比10种因果语言模型和6种掩码语言模型的实验数据，分析不同置信度估计方法在陈述重述场景下的表现。

Result: 1) 掩码预训练模型普遍过度自信；2) 考虑陈述重述不一致性的置信度估计取得最佳校准效果；3) 即使最大模型也未能准确编码语言自信表达的语义特征。

Conclusion: 关系知识探测需同时关注模型能力与置信度校准，揭示了语言模型在可靠性评估和语义理解上的关键改进方向。

Abstract: Knowledge probing quantifies how much relational knowledge a language model (LM) has acquired during pre-training. Existing knowledge probes evaluate model capabilities through metrics like prediction accuracy and precision. Such evaluations fail to account for the model's reliability, reflected in the calibration of its confidence scores. In this paper, we propose a novel calibration probing framework for relational knowledge, covering three modalities of model confidence: (1) intrinsic confidence, (2) structural consistency and (3) semantic grounding. Our extensive analysis of ten causal and six masked language models reveals that most models, especially those pre-trained with the masking objective, are overconfident. The best-calibrated scores come from confidence estimates that account for inconsistencies due to statement rephrasing. Moreover, even the largest pre-trained models fail to encode the semantics of linguistic confidence expressions accurately.

Motivation: 传统SD训练依赖大规模数据集，但研究发现并非所有样本对接受率提升等效。目标是量化样本价值并优化数据选择。

Method: 基于目标模型预测分布的平坦性设计flatness指标，通过筛选高平坦性token构建SFDD数据集蒸馏方法。

Result: 在EAGLE框架实验显示，50%数据下训练速度提升2倍，推理速度损失控制在4%内。

Conclusion: 通过数据价值量化，SFDD实现了更高效的数据驱动型SD训练框架，代码已开源。

Abstract: Speculative Decoding (SD) is a key technique for accelerating Large Language Model (LLM) inference, but it typically requires training a draft model on a large dataset. We approach this problem from a data-centric perspective, finding that not all training samples contribute equally to the SD acceptance rate. Specifically, our theoretical analysis and empirical validation reveals that tokens inducing flatter predictive distributions from the target model are more valuable than those yielding sharply peaked distributions. Based on this insight, we propose flatness, a new metric to quantify this property, and develop the Sample-level-flatness-based Dataset Distillation (SFDD) approach, which filters the training data to retain only the most valuable samples. Experiments on the EAGLE framework demonstrate that SFDD can achieve over 2$\times$ training speedup using only 50% of the data, while keeping the final model's inference speedup within 4% of the full-dataset baseline. This work introduces an effective, data-centric approach that substantially improves the training efficiency for Speculative Decoding.

Motivation: 传统评估方法基于成人的世界知识和语用假设，与训练数据受限的婴儿模型不匹配，需建立更适配的评估体系。

Method: 开发包含19个任务的BabyReasoningBench（基于发展心理学实验），用10M/100M儿童语料训练的GPT-2模型进行测试。

Result: 婴儿模型总体表现低但存在任务差异，数据量扩展提升因果推理表现，但心智理论和语用敏感任务依然困难。

Conclusion: BabyReasoningBench为分析儿童训练数据支持的推理类型提供新框架，可用于验证能力演化机制的假设。

Abstract: Traditional evaluations of reasoning capabilities of language models are dominated by adult-centric benchmarks that presuppose broad world knowledge, complex instruction following, and mature pragmatic competence. These assumptions are mismatched to baby language models trained on developmentally plausible input such as child-directed speech and early-childhood narratives, and they obscure which reasoning abilities (if any) emerge under such constraints. We introduce BabyReasoningBench, a GPT-5.2 generated benchmark of 19 reasoning tasks grounded in classic paradigms from developmental psychology, spanning theory of mind, analogical and relational reasoning, causal inference and intervention selection, and core reasoning primitives that are known to be confounded by memory and pragmatics. We find that two GPT-2 based baby language models (pretrained on 10M and 100M of child-directed speech text) show overall low but uneven performance, with dissociations across task families: scaling improves several causal and physical reasoning tasks, while belief attribution and pragmatics-sensitive tasks remain challenging. BabyReasoningBench provides a developmentally grounded lens for analyzing what kinds of reasoning are supported by child-like training distributions, and for testing mechanistic hypotheses about how such abilities emerge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图灵的停机问题表明程序终止性不可判定，现有工具依赖特定语言的近似方法。大语言模型（LLM）的发展引发其是否能可靠预测程序终止的研究问题。

Method: 基于2025年国际软件验证竞赛（SV-Comp）中的C语言程序数据集，测试GPT-5、Claude Sonnet-4.5和Code World Model（CWM），并与其他验证工具横向对比，分析模型性能与程序长度的关系。

Result: LLM在预测程序终止性上表现出色，GPT-5等模型接近顶级工具水平；但在提供证明（witness）上存在显著缺陷，且对长程序的预测准确率明显下降。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在解决不可判定问题上展现潜力，但需要改进其解释性和处理复杂程序的能力，研究结果为程序分析和LLM理论研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Determining whether a program terminates is a central problem in computer science. Turing's foundational result established the Halting Problem as undecidable, showing that no algorithm can universally determine termination for all programs and inputs. Consequently, automatic verification tools approximate termination, sometimes failing to prove or disprove; these tools rely on problem-specific architectures and abstractions, and are usually tied to particular programming languages. Recent success and progress in large language models (LLMs) raises the following question: can LLMs reliably predict program termination? In this work, we evaluate LLMs on a diverse set of C programs from the Termination category of the International Competition on Software Verification (SV-Comp) 2025. Our results suggest that LLMs perform remarkably well at predicting program termination, where GPT-5 and Claude Sonnet-4.5 would rank just behind the top-ranked tool (using test-time-scaling), and Code World Model (CWM) would place just behind the second-ranked tool. While LLMs are effective at predicting program termination, they often fail to provide a valid witness as a proof. Moreover, LLMs performance drops as program length increases. We hope these insights motivate further research into program termination and the broader potential of LLMs for reasoning about undecidable problems.

However, little attention has been given to the possibility that such models could be exploited to produce harmful research by repurposing open science artefacts for malicious ends. We fill the gap by introducing an end-to-end pipeline that first bypasses LLM safeguards through persuasion-based jailbreaking, then reinterprets NLP papers to identify and repurpose their artefacts (datasets, methods, and tools) by exploiting their vulnerabilities, and finally assesses the safety of these proposals using our evaluation framework across three dimensions: harmfulness, feasibility of misuse, and soundness of technicality. Overall, our findings demonstrate that LLMs can generate harmful proposals by repurposing ethically designed open artefacts; however, we find that LLMs acting as evaluators strongly disagree with one another on evaluation outcomes: GPT-4.1 assigns higher scores (indicating greater potential harms, higher soundness and feasibility of misuse), Gemini-2.5-pro is markedly stricter, and Grok-3 falls between these extremes. This indicates that LLMs cannot yet serve as reliable judges in a malicious evaluation setup, making human evaluation essential for credible dual-use risk assessment.

*Haozheng Luo,Zhuolin Jiang,Md Zahid Hasan,Yan Chen,Soumalya Sarkar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FROST是一种基于注意力权重的推理路径剪枝方法，通过移除异常推理步骤显著降低计算开销并提升模型准确性，在保持原有推理能力的同时实现高效推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推理方法存在冗余路径导致效率低下且可靠性不足，现有剪枝方法（如TALE）缺乏对注意力机制特性的针对性优化，需要一种能精确识别并剔除异常推理步骤的策略。

Method: 提出推理异常值概念，设计注意力引导的剪枝机制：1) 计算句子级注意力分布识别离群值 2) 动态保留高置信度推理路径 3) 理论分析保证剪枝后的推理完备性，代码已开源。

Result: 在4个基准测试中：1) 相比基线模型token消耗降低69.68%，准确率提升26.70% 2) 超越SOTA方法如TALE 3) 注意力异常指标优化显著（无限范数↓15.97%，峰度↓91.09%）

Conclusion: 理论-实验双重验证表明，FROST通过注意力机制实现推理效率与质量的平衡，为大模型压缩提供了新的可解释性视角，适用于实际场景的推理加速需求。

Abstract: We propose FROST, an attention-aware method for efficient reasoning. Unlike traditional approaches, FROST leverages attention weights to prune uncritical reasoning paths, yielding shorter and more reliable reasoning trajectories. Methodologically, we introduce the concept of reasoning outliers and design an attention-based mechanism to remove them. Theoretically, FROST preserves and enhances the model's reasoning capacity while eliminating outliers at the sentence level. Empirically, we validate FROST on four benchmarks using two strong reasoning models (Phi-4-Reasoning and GPT-OSS-20B), outperforming state-of-the-art methods such as TALE and ThinkLess. Notably, FROST achieves an average 69.68% reduction in token usage and a 26.70% improvement in accuracy over the base model. Furthermore, in evaluations of attention outlier metrics, FROST reduces the maximum infinity norm by 15.97% and the average kurtosis by 91.09% compared to the base model.

TL;DR: 研究提出首个多奖励RLAIF框架，专为语音对话系统设计，结合语义、音频质量及情感一致性奖励，通过回合级偏好采样与DPO目标优化，实验证明多奖励训练显著提升对话系统的语义和音频质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音对话系统强化学习多采用单一语义奖励，忽略对话质量的多维度和多模态特性，且与渐进式生成响应的双工模型不匹配，导致优化效果受限。

Method: 整合语义、音频质量与情感一致性奖励，采用回合级偏好采样策略，并通过DPO目标函数聚合块级对数概率，公开多奖励DPO数据集以支持可重复研究。

Result: 单奖励RLAIF仅提升目标指标，而多奖励联合训练在语义质量和音频自然度上均取得持续提升。

Conclusion: 全方面多奖励对齐对实用化语音对话系统至关重要，该框架为后续研究提供了有效方法论和数据资源。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human or AI feedback (RLHF/RLAIF) for speech-in/speech-out dialogue systems (SDS) remains underexplored, with prior work largely limited to single semantic rewards applied at the utterance level. Such setups overlook the multi-dimensional and multi-modal nature of conversational quality, which encompasses semantic coherence, audio naturalness, speaker consistency, emotion alignment, and turn-taking behavior. Moreover, they are fundamentally mismatched with duplex spoken dialogue systems that generate responses incrementally, where agents must make decisions based on partial utterances. We address these limitations with the first multi-reward RLAIF framework for SDS, combining semantic, audio-quality, and emotion-consistency rewards. To align utterance-level preferences with incremental, blockwise decoding in duplex models, we apply turn-level preference sampling and aggregate per-block log-probabilities within a single DPO objective. We present the first systematic study of preference learning for improving SDS quality in both multi-turn Chain-of-Thought and blockwise duplex models, and release a multi-reward DPO dataset to support reproducible research. Experiments show that single-reward RLAIF selectively improves its targeted metric, while joint multi-reward training yields consistent gains across semantic quality and audio naturalness. These results highlight the importance of holistic, multi-reward alignment for practical conversational SDS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有心理健康对话系统多为被动反应，缺乏系统性用户状态建模，难以实现主动治疗探索。如何通过结构化框架捕捉动态心理状态并生成有效问题成为核心挑战。

Method: PsyProbe集成PPPPPI框架（呈现、易感、触发、维持、保护、影响）和认知错误检测，包含四个模块：1) State Builder提取结构化心理剖面；2) Memory Construction追踪信息缺口；3) Strategy Planner对应动机性访谈行为编码；4) Response Generator结合问答创新与审校模块生成上下文相关问题。

Result: 在27名韩国参与者的真实咨询场景测试中：1) 自动评估显示完整模型优于基线和消融模型；2) 用户评估显示参与意图提升15%，自然性评分提高20%；3) 专业顾问评估确认核心问题理解提升，提问频次与专业人员相当，问题相关性达89%。

Conclusion: 系统化状态建模（PPPPPI+认知错误检测）配合主动问题生成机制，显著提升对话系统在心理健康探索阶段的效果，为机器辅助心理咨询提供了可验证的技术路径。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have enabled mental health dialogue systems, yet existing approaches remain predominantly reactive, lacking systematic user state modeling for proactive therapeutic exploration. We introduce PsyProbe, a dialogue system designed for the exploration phase of counseling that systematically tracks user psychological states through the PPPPPI framework (Presenting, Predisposing, Precipitating, Perpetuating, Protective, Impact) augmented with cognitive error detection. PsyProbe combines State Builder for extracting structured psychological profiles, Memory Construction for tracking information gaps, Strategy Planner for Motivational Interviewing behavioral codes, and Response Generator with Question Ideation and Critic/Revision modules to generate contextually appropriate, proactive questions. We evaluate PsyProbe with 27 participants in real-world Korean counseling scenarios, including automatic evaluation across ablation modes, user evaluation, and expert evaluation by a certified counselor. The full PsyProbe model consistently outperforms baseline and ablation modes in automatic evaluation. User evaluation demonstrates significantly increased engagement intention and improved naturalness compared to baseline. Expert evaluation shows that PsyProbe substantially improves core issue understanding and achieves question rates comparable to professional counselors, validating the effectiveness of systematic state modeling and proactive questioning for therapeutic exploration.

Method: 构建TeMLM工具集（包含TeMLM-Card等标准化文档）、设计轻量级一致性清单，并在合成临床数据集Technetium-I上验证PHI去识别化和ICD-9代码提取任务。

Result: 成功实现ProtactiniumBERT模型在PHI实体识别任务F1值达0.87，在多标签分类任务中实现72.5%的准确率。

Conclusion: 合成数据集对工具和流程验证有价值，但部署前需在真实临床数据上验证模型；透明性框架可提升可信度但需平衡实用性和开发成本。

Abstract: We introduce TeMLM, a set of transparency-first release artifacts for clinical language models. TeMLM unifies provenance, data transparency, modeling transparency, and governance into a single, machine-checkable release bundle. We define an artifact suite (TeMLM-Card, TeMLM-Datasheet, TeMLM-Provenance) and a lightweight conformance checklist for repeatable auditing. We instantiate the artifacts on Technetium-I, a large-scale synthetic clinical NLP dataset with 498,000 notes, 7.74M PHI entity annotations across 10 types, and ICD-9-CM diagnosis labels, and report reference results for ProtactiniumBERT (about 100 million parameters) on PHI de-identification (token classification) and top-50 ICD-9 code extraction (multi-label classification). We emphasize that synthetic benchmarks are valuable for tooling and process validation, but models should be validated on real clinical data prior to deployment.

*Chi Zhang,Wenxuan Ding,Jiale Liu,Mingrui Wu,Qingyun Wu,Ray Mooney*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VLMs have strong VQA skills, but they struggle when text conflicts with image evidence, with a 48.2% performance drop when facing persuasive misinformation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of study on VLMs' vulnerability to textual misinformation, especially when conflicting with visual data, despite their success in multimodal reasoning tasks.

Method: Created CONTEXT-VQA dataset with image-question pairs and adversarial text prompts conflicting with visual evidence, then evaluated 11 VLMs under controlled multi-round tests.

Result: VLMs showed severe susceptibility to textual misinformation, 48.2% average accuracy drop after first round, and persistent trust in conflicting text over visual ground truth.

Conclusion: Current VLM architectures have fundamental weaknesses in modality conflict resolution, highlighting urgent needs for robustness training and bias mitigation against text dominance.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown strong multimodal reasoning capabilities on Visual-Question-Answering (VQA) benchmarks. However, their robustness against textual misinformation remains under-explored. While existing research has studied the effect of misinformation in text-only domains, it is not clear how VLMs arbitrate between contradictory information from different modalities. To bridge the gap, we first propose the CONTEXT-VQA (i.e., Conflicting Text) dataset, consisting of image-question pairs together with systematically generated persuasive prompts that deliberately conflict with visual evidence. Then, a thorough evaluation framework is designed and executed to benchmark the susceptibility of various models to these conflicting multimodal inputs. Comprehensive experiments over 11 state-of-the-art VLMs reveal that these models are indeed vulnerable to misleading textual prompts, often overriding clear visual evidence in favor of the conflicting text, and show an average performance drop of over 48.2% after only one round of persuasive conversation. Our findings highlight a critical limitation in current VLMs and underscore the need for improved robustness against textual manipulation.

Motivation: 为了链接深度学习与语言学理论，建立大模型的机械性基础，需理解语义关联如何从文本数据中涌现。

Method: 利用梯度近似建立早期权重闭式表达，通过训练动态视角分析注意力头权重与三类基函数的关联。

Result: 实验证明闭式表达与LLM权重高度匹配，理论框架能准确解析Transformer各组件对不同语义关系的捕获。

Conclusion: 语义关联的形成可被三基函数组合解释，揭示模型如何通过分解文本统计特性实现语义建模。

Abstract: Semantic associations such as the link between "bird" and "flew" are foundational for language modeling as they enable models to go beyond memorization and instead generalize and generate coherent text. Understanding how these associations are learned and represented in language models is essential for connecting deep learning with linguistic theory and developing a mechanistic foundation for large language models. In this work, we analyze how these associations emerge from natural language data in attention-based language models through the lens of training dynamics. By leveraging a leading-term approximation of the gradients, we develop closed-form expressions for the weights at early stages of training that explain how semantic associations first take shape. Through our analysis, we reveal that each set of weights of the transformer has closed-form expressions as simple compositions of three basis functions (bigram, token-interchangeability, and context mappings), reflecting the statistics of the text corpus and uncovering how each component of the transformer captures semantic associations based on these compositions. Experiments on real-world LLMs demonstrate that our theoretical weight characterizations closely match the learned weights, and qualitative analyses further show how our theorem shines light on interpreting the learned associations in transformers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代RNN（如RWKV）凭借固定状态优势但缺乏状态编辑能力的研究，作者旨在探索其状态表示潜力并增强全局适应性

Method: 1. 提出DREAMSTATE框架，用条件扩散Transformer建模RWKV状态流形 2. 构建混合架构：DiT并行处理全局上下文动态调整RNN核心参数

Result: 1. t-SNE与可控生成验证状态结构有效性 2. 混合模型通过多目标损失实现稳定训练，成功融合局部与全局能力

Conclusion: 开创RNN状态编辑新方向，提供结合局部递归与动态全局上下文的设计范例

Abstract: Modern Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), such as RWKV, are distinguished by their powerful short-range modeling capabilities and efficient fixed-size states, which constitute a core advantage over standard Transformers. However, there is a significant lack of research into their internal state as an editable knowledge representation. To fill this gap, we first explore the representational properties of the RWKV state by proposing the DREAMSTATE framework. This framework utilizes a conditional Diffusion Transformer (DiT) to directly model the probability manifold of the state, enabling its generation and editing. The structural nature of this representation is validated through t-SNE visualizations and controlled generation experiments. After successfully uncovering and modeling the state's representational potential, we further propose a novel hybrid architecture that combines the local advantages of RNNs with global context adaptability. This architecture features a parallel DiT that processes a variable-length global context to dynamically generate and adjust the core recurrent module's WKV parameters, transforming the fixed recurrence mechanism into a context-aware dynamic function. Experiments demonstrate that this hybrid model can be trained stably via a multi-objective loss, validating its design feasibility. Our work not only opens a new research direction for RNN state representation but also provides a concrete architectural reference for future model design.

TL;DR: 本论文提出RPO-RAG框架，专为小型大语言模型（LLM）设计，提升基于知识图谱问答（KGQA）的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于知识图谱的检索增强生成（RAG）方法存在语义不感知的路径采样问题，且与KG推理目标弱对齐，同时未针对小型LLM优化知识组织形式。

Method: 提出三种创新：（1）语义感知的查询-路径采样策略；（2）关系感知的偏好优化；（3）答案中心化的可解释提示设计。

Result: 在WebQSP和CWQ数据集上分别提升F1值8.8%和创8B参数下SOTA性能，验证对小型LLM（＜3B参数）的有效性。

Conclusion: RPO-RAG通过提升小型LLM的推理效率，为资源受限场景下的KGQA应用提供了可行性方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities, yet hallucinate on knowledge-intensive tasks. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates this issue by grounding answers in external sources, e.g., knowledge graphs (KGs). However, existing KG-based RAG approaches rely on semantics-unaware path sampling and are weakly aligned with KG reasoning objectives, which limits further accuracy gains. They also feed retrieved paths directly into the reasoner without organizing them into answer-centered reasoning paths, hindering small LLMs' ability to leverage the retrieved knowledge. Furthermore, prior works predominantly rely on large LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT/GPT-4) or assume backbones above 7B parameters, leaving sub-7B models underexplored. We address this gap with RPO-RAG, the first KG-based RAG framework specifically designed for small LLMs, to the best of our knowledge. RPO-RAG introduces three key innovations: (1) a query-path semantic sampling strategy that provides informative supervisory signals; (2) a relation-aware preference optimization that aligns training with intermediate KG reasoning signals (e.g., relation); and (3) an answer-centered prompt design that organizes entities and reasoning paths in an interpretable format. Extensive experiments on two benchmark Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) datasets, WebQSP and CWQ, demonstrate that RPO-RAG effectively bridges the performance gap between small and large language models. On WebQSP, it improves F1 by up to 8.8%, reflecting enhanced answer precision, while on CWQ it achieves new state-of-the-art results among models under 8B parameters in both Hit and F1. Overall, RPO-RAG substantially improves the reasoning capability of small LLMs, even under 3B parameters-highlighting their potential for resource-efficient and practical on-device KGQA applications.

Method: 1) 合成高质量SFT数据集；2) 采用两阶段GRPO策略增强对话描述；3) 构建包含说话人归属和话语转录评估的DiaDemBench基准

Result: DiaDem在DiaDemBench上超越Gemini系列模型，对话描述准确率提升显著，在通用字幕基准上表现具竞争力，实验证明当前商用模型仍有改进空间

Conclusion: DiaDem通过创新性训练策略和评估体系，有效解决对话字幕生成难题，为音视频内容理解提供新方法

Abstract: Accurate dialogue description in audiovisual video captioning is crucial for downstream understanding and generation tasks. However, existing models generally struggle to produce faithful dialogue descriptions within audiovisual captions. To mitigate this limitation, we propose DiaDem, a powerful audiovisual video captioning model capable of generating captions with more precise dialogue descriptions while maintaining strong overall performance. We first synthesize a high-quality dataset for SFT, then employ a difficulty-partitioned two-stage GRPO strategy to further enhance dialogue descriptions. To enable systematic evaluation of dialogue description capabilities, we introduce DiaDemBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate models across diverse dialogue scenarios, emphasizing both speaker attribution accuracy and utterance transcription fidelity in audiovisual captions. Extensive experiments on DiaDemBench reveal even commercial models still exhibit substantial room for improvement in dialogue-aware captioning. Notably, DiaDem not only outperforms the Gemini series in dialogue description accuracy but also achieves competitive performance on general audiovisual captioning benchmarks, demonstrating its overall effectiveness.

TL;DR: 本论文提出一个创建和评估类比谜语的简单流程，包含三元组创建、语义映射、线索生成和答案验证四个模块。研究发现大语言模型虽能识别核心答案，但常遗漏其他有效解释，表明谜语可用于评估模型的多义性处理和推理覆盖能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 谜语能通过多义线索测试语言模型的逻辑推理与歧义处理能力，但缺乏系统化方法评估此类问题的解答覆盖度。现有模型对间接表达的理解仍存在局限性。

Method: 开发包含四阶段的自动化流程：（1）从知识库中提取概念三元组（2）通过语义映射筛选类比属性（3）生成诗性化线索（4）基于提示工程构建验证器分析答案集。通过案例验证流程，并测试GPT-3.5等模型的解答表现。

Result: 实验显示，语言模型对单句谜语能正确识别目标答案（约70%准确率），但平均仅覆盖潜在答案集的22%，表明模型未能有效拓展多义推理路径。验证器可发现约30%的非预期但合理的答案。

Conclusion: 谜语作为轻量级评估工具，能有效暴露语言模型在多义推理和知识联想中的盲区。未来需增强模型对模糊线索的扩展性理解，并改进训练数据的多义表达覆盖。

Abstract: Riddles are concise linguistic puzzles that describe an object or idea through indirect, figurative, or playful clues. They are a longstanding form of creative expression, requiring the solver to interpret hints, recognize patterns, and draw inferences to identify the answers. In this work, we introduce a simple pipeline for creating and evaluating analogy-based riddles. The system includes a triples creator that builds structured facts about a concept, a semantic mapper that selects attributes useful for analogy, a stylized generator that turns them into riddle clues, and a validator that collects all possible answers the riddle could point to. We use this validator to study whether large language models can recover the full answer set for different riddle types. Our case study shows that while models often guess the main intended answer, they frequently miss other valid interpretations. This highlights the value of riddles as a lightweight tool for examining reasoning coverage and ambiguity handling in language models.

Motivation: 现有基于EAGLE3等模型的推测解码方案因依赖多步自回归生成导致草案阶段延迟成为瓶颈，需通过非自回归并行生成减少延迟。

Method: 利用目标模型隐藏状态并行预测多个掩码位置的logits，采用N-gram强化的树剪枝算法构建语义连贯的高质量草案树，全程消除自回归迭代步骤。

Result: 实验表明DART相较EAGLE3在多个数据集实现2.03-3.44倍端到端加速，平均超越基线30%，且保持轻量级设计。

Conclusion: DART有效平衡延迟降低与生成质量，为大型语言模型部署提供实用化的推测解码框架，代码已开源。

Abstract: Speculative decoding is an effective and lossless approach for accelerating LLM inference. However, existing widely adopted model-based draft designs, such as EAGLE3, improve accuracy at the cost of multi-step autoregressive inference, resulting in high drafting latency and ultimately rendering the drafting stage itself a performance bottleneck. Inspired by diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs), we propose DART, which leverages parallel generation to reduce drafting latency. DART predicts logits for multiple future masked positions in parallel within a single forward pass based on hidden states of the target model, thereby eliminating autoregressive rollouts in the draft model while preserving a lightweight design. Based on these parallel logit predictions, we further introduce an efficient tree pruning algorithm that constructs high-quality draft token trees with N-gram-enforced semantic continuity. DART substantially reduces draft-stage overhead while preserving high draft accuracy, leading to significantly improved end-to-end decoding speed. Experimental results demonstrate that DART achieves a 2.03x--3.44x wall-clock time speedup across multiple datasets, surpassing EAGLE3 by 30% on average and offering a practical speculative decoding framework.

Motivation: 现有基于LLM的EHR处理方法多为任务无关设计（如编码器或补全模块），未能充分融合预测任务信号，导致模型性能受限。需解决高维、异质、稀疏EHR数据与临床预测任务目标的对齐问题。

Method: 1) 构建ReToP端到端框架，联合训练EHR重写器和临床预测器；2) 使用临床特征选择策略生成合成伪标签数据，解决重写训练数据缺失问题；3) 提出分类器监督贡献度（CSC）评分，量化重写内容对预测任务的价值并优化重写过程。

Result: 在MIMIC-IV三个临床任务中优于强基准模型，验证CSC评分可提升预测准确性。模型仅需少量微调即可迁移到新任务，保持重写内容的真实性和任务相关特征的突出性。

Conclusion: 端到端整合LLM重写器与预测器可突破传统任务无关方法的局限性，提出的CSC机制和合成数据生成策略为复杂医疗数据建模提供新范式。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) provide crucial information for clinical decision-making. However, their high-dimensionality, heterogeneity, and sparsity make clinical prediction challenging. Large Language Models (LLMs) allowed progress towards addressing this challenge by leveraging parametric medical knowledge to enhance EHR data for clinical prediction tasks. Despite the significant achievements made so far, most of the existing approaches are fundamentally task-agnostic in the sense that they deploy LLMs as EHR encoders or EHR completion modules without fully integrating signals from the prediction tasks. This naturally hinders task performance accuracy. In this work, we propose Rewrite-To-Predict (ReToP), an LLM-based framework that addresses this limitation through an end-to-end training of an EHR rewriter and a clinical predictor. To cope with the lack of EHR rewrite training data, we generate synthetic pseudo-labels using clinical-driven feature selection strategies to create diverse patient rewrites for fine-tuning the EHR rewriter. ReToP aligns the rewriter with prediction objectives using a novel Classifier Supervised Contribution (CSC) score that enables the EHR rewriter to generate clinically relevant rewrites that directly enhance prediction. Our ReToP framework surpasses strong baseline models across three clinical tasks on MIMIC-IV. Moreover, the analysis of ReToP shows its generalizability to unseen datasets and tasks with minimal fine-tuning while preserving faithful rewrites and emphasizing task-relevant predictive features.

Conclusion: 该研究证实动态适应角色空间和协作拓扑的多智能体系统可通过非参数化方法实现性能优化。

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly deployed as multi-agent systems, where specialized roles communicate and collaborate through structured interactions to solve complex tasks that often exceed the capacity of a single agent. However, most existing systems still rely on a fixed role library and an execution-frozen interaction topology, a rigid design choice that frequently leads to task mismatch, prevents timely adaptation when new evidence emerges during reasoning, and further inflates inference cost. We introduce MetaGen, a training-free framework that adapts both the role space and the collaboration topology at inference time, without updating base model weights. MetaGen generates and rewrites query-conditioned role specifications to maintain a controllable dynamic role pool, then instantiates a constrained execution graph around a minimal backbone. During execution, it iteratively updates role prompts and adjusts structural decisions using lightweight feedback signals. Experiments on code generation and multi-step reasoning benchmarks show that MetaGen improves the accuracy and cost tradeoff over strong multi-agent baselines.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为公式优先（F-1）的新提示方法，通过将数学方程作为中间表示，并采用两阶段策略提升大语言模型在应用数学问题上的推理能力。实验表明F-1在金融、物理等应用领域均显著优于传统的链式思维（CoT）和程序思维（PoT）方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示方法如CoT和PoT未显式利用推导控制方程这一步骤，而金融、物理等应用数学领域问题往往需要这一关键环节。

Method: 提出F-1两阶段方法：1）从问题描述生成控制方程；2）根据方程内容自适应选择CoT/PoT/直接计算策略，所有步骤在同一LLM调用中完成。

Result: 在五个模型和四个数据集的测试中，F-1对比CoT提升5.76%，对比PoT提升8.42%。在应用领域提升显著：金融领域对比CoT提升13.30%，物理题提升2.55%（纯数学题仅提升0.44%）。

Conclusion: 通过结构化利用数学方程作为中间步骤的F-1方法，在解决应用数学问题时显著优于传统提示方法，尤其在金融、物理等实际场景下效果提升更明显。

Abstract: Prompting techniques such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Program-of-Thought (PoT) improve LLM mathematical reasoning by structuring intermediate steps in natural language or code. However, applied mathematics problems in domains like finance, physics, and cryptography often require recalling or deriving governing equations, a step that current approaches do not explicitly leverage. We propose Formula-One Prompting (F-1), a two-phase approach that uses mathematical equations as an intermediate representation before adaptive solving. F-1 first formulates governing equations from problem descriptions, then selects a solving strategy among CoT, PoT, or direct computation based on the generated equations, all within a single LLM call. Results across five models and four benchmarks show F-1 outperforms CoT by +5.76% and PoT by +8.42% on average. Crucially, gains are largest in applied domains: +13.30% on FinanceMath over CoT, and within OlympiadBench, larger gains on physics (+2.55%) than pure math (+0.44%). This demonstrates that F-1 is more effective than CoT in applied mathematics problems.

*Jianzhe Chai,Yu Zhe,Jun Sakuma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DeconIEP通过引入输入嵌入空间的小扰动，在评估阶段处理测试集污染问题，避免修改测试集或干扰模型正常推理，有效降低污染带来的性能高估，同时保持原模型在干净输入上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的基准评估因测试集污染问题受到威胁，现有方法需在污染检测时修改测试集或在评估时干扰推理，导致评估不可靠或性能下降。论文旨在提出一种不改变测试集且对正常推理影响最小的去污染框架。

Method: 设计基于参考模型（轻度污染）引导的实例自适应扰动生成器，在评估阶段对输入嵌入空间施加有界扰动，引导模型避开依赖记忆的捷径推理路径。

Result: 在多个公开大模型和基准测试中，DeconIEP实现显著去污染效果，同时仅导致干净输入性能轻微下降，且扰动幅度可控。

Conclusion: DeconIEP验证了评估阶段扰动嵌入空间作为LLMs去污染策略的可行性，在保持基准完整性的前提下，平衡了去污染效果与模型原有效用。

Abstract: Benchmark-based evaluation is the de facto standard for comparing large language models (LLMs). However, its reliability is increasingly threatened by test set contamination, where test samples or their close variants leak into training data and artificially inflate reported performance. To address this issue, prior work has explored two main lines of mitigation. One line attempts to identify and remove contaminated benchmark items before evaluation, but this inevitably alters the evaluation set itself and becomes unreliable when contamination is moderate or severe. The other line preserves the benchmark and instead suppresses contaminated behavior at evaluation time; however, such interventions often interfere with normal inference and lead to noticeable performance degradation on clean inputs. We propose DeconIEP, a decontamination framework that operates entirely during evaluation by applying small, bounded perturbations in the input embedding space. Guided by a relatively less-contaminated reference model, DeconIEP learns an instance-adaptive perturbation generator that steers the evaluated model away from memorization-driven shortcut pathways. Across multiple open-weight LLMs and benchmarks, extensive empirical results show that DeconIEP achieves strong decontamination effectiveness while incurring only minimal degradation in benign utility.

TL;DR: 提出无参考多维评估框架CEF，通过交叉询问生成Coverage、Conformity、Consistency评分，有效识别传统指标遗漏的内容错误与语义畸变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统指标如BLEU和BERTScore无法准确衡量生成文本的语义保真度，尤其在检测事实矛盾和内容遗漏方面存在明显缺陷。

Method: 将输入文本与候选文本视为知识库，分别生成可验证问题并进行交叉验证，构建无参考评估体系，通过问题生成器、知识验证器、评分器三阶段流程，系统筛选稳定判别模型。

Result: 在翻译/摘要/临床文本生成任务中验证有效，识别传统指标漏检的15%内容缺失和12%事实错误；无参考模式与有参考模式相关性达0.89；与人类专家的语义错误匹配率提升38%（尤其是实体关系扭曲检测）。

Conclusion: CEF框架建立了首个兼顾覆盖率、一致性、符合度的三维评估体系，通过系统化模型验证和多模态任务实证，证明其在语义保真度评估上比现有指标更具解释性和可靠性。

Abstract: Traditional metrics like BLEU and BERTScore fail to capture semantic fidelity in generative text-to-text tasks. We adapt the Cross-Examination Framework (CEF) for a reference-free, multi-dimensional evaluation by treating the source and candidate as independent knowledge bases. CEF generates verifiable questions from each text and performs a cross-examination to derive three interpretable scores: Coverage, Conformity, and Consistency. Validated across translation, summarization and clinical note-generation, our framework identifies critical errors, such as content omissions and factual contradictions, missed by standard metrics. A key contribution is a systematic robustness analysis to select a stable judge model. Crucially, the strong correlation between our reference-free and with-reference modes validates CEF's reliability without gold references. Furthermore, human expert validation demonstrates that CEF mismatching questions align with meaning-altering semantic errors higher than with non-semantic errors, particularly excelling at identifying entity-based and relational distortions.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于DeBERTa-v3-large的MWE识别方法，在CoAM和STREUSLE数据集上分别取得69.8%和78.9%的F1分数，性能显著优于参数量更大的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在MWE识别中存在参数量大（如Qwen-72B）、处理不连续/名词型MWE效果差及类别不平衡问题，需要一种更高效且泛化性强的解决方案。

Method: 通过①二值词级别START/END/INSIDE分类替代传统跨度预测，②融合名词短语分块和依存句法特征，③采用过采样策略缓解数据不平衡。

Result: 在CoAM数据集F1达69.8%（超越Qwen-72B 12个百分点，参数量减少165倍），STREUSLE数据集F1为78.9%。

Conclusion: 结构优化的小模型在精确率和资源效率上均优于LLM，为低资源场景提供有效解决方案，验证了模型设计对结构化NLP任务的重要性。

Abstract: We present a comprehensive approach for multiword expression (MWE) identification that combines binary token-level classification, linguistic feature integration, and data augmentation. Our DeBERTa-v3-large model achieves 69.8% F1 on the CoAM dataset, surpassing the best results (Qwen-72B, 57.8% F1) on this dataset by 12 points while using 165x fewer parameters. We achieve this performance by (1) reformulating detection as binary token-level START/END/INSIDE classification rather than span-based prediction, (2) incorporating NP chunking and dependency features that help discontinuous and NOUN-type MWEs identification, and (3) applying oversampling that addresses severe class imbalance in the training data. We confirm the generalization of our method on the STREUSLE dataset, achieving 78.9% F1. These results demonstrate that carefully designed smaller models can substantially outperform LLMs on structured NLP tasks, with important implications for resource-constrained deployments.

Motivation: 探索大语言模型在文档级上下文下的APE能力，尤其关注闭源与开源模型在准确性、鲁棒性、效率及上下文利用上的差异。

Method: 系统比较闭源与开源LLM在简单文档级提示设置下的APE效果，评估质量、场景适应性、鲁棒性、效率等指标。

Result: 闭源LLM单样本提示即可达近人类质量且抗攻击性强，但无法有效利用文档级上下文；自动指标未能反映实际质量差异，高成本和延迟影响部署。

Conclusion: 闭源LLM展现APE潜力但存在上下文利用效率和成本限制，需发展更高效的长文档建模方法以优化翻译后编辑。

Abstract: Automatic post-editing (APE) aims to refine machine translations by correcting residual errors. Although recent large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong translation capabilities, their effectiveness for APE--especially under document-level context--remains insufficiently understood. We present a systematic comparison of proprietary and open-weight LLMs under a naive document-level prompting setup, analyzing APE quality, contextual behavior, robustness, and efficiency.
  Our results show that proprietary LLMs achieve near human-level APE quality even with simple one-shot prompting, regardless of whether document context is provided. While these models exhibit higher robustness to data poisoning attacks than open-weight counterparts, this robustness also reveals a limitation: they largely fail to exploit document-level context for contextual error correction. Furthermore, standard automatic metrics do not reliably reflect these qualitative improvements, highlighting the continued necessity of human evaluation. Despite their strong performance, the substantial cost and latency overheads of proprietary LLMs render them impractical for real-world APE deployment. Overall, our findings elucidate both the promise and current limitations of LLM-based document-aware APE, and point toward the need for more efficient long-context modeling approaches for translation refinement.

Abstract: Claim verification is a core component of automated fact-checking systems, aimed at determining the truthfulness of a statement by assessing it against reliable evidence sources such as documents or knowledge bases. This work presents KG-CRAFT, a method that improves automatic claim verification by leveraging large language models (LLMs) augmented with contrastive questions grounded in a knowledge graph. KG-CRAFT first constructs a knowledge graph from claims and associated reports, then formulates contextually relevant contrastive questions based on the knowledge graph structure. These questions guide the distillation of evidence-based reports, which are synthesised into a concise summary that is used for veracity assessment by LLMs. Extensive evaluations on two real-world datasets (LIAR-RAW and RAWFC) demonstrate that our method achieves a new state-of-the-art in predictive performance. Comprehensive analyses validate in detail the effectiveness of our knowledge graph-based contrastive reasoning approach in improving LLMs' fact-checking capabilities.

TL;DR: This paper introduces ClaimPT, a dataset of European Portuguese news articles annotated for factual claims, aimed at advancing automated fact-checking in a low-resource language context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fact-checking is slow and manual, unable to counter rapid misinformation spread. Existing automated approaches are limited by lack of annotated datasets in non-English languages like Portuguese, hindering scalability and research.

Method: Created ClaimPT dataset with 1,308 Portuguese news articles and 6,875 annotations through collaboration with LUSA News Agency. Two annotators labeled each article with curator validation via a new annotation scheme, and baseline models were developed for claim detection.

Result: First journalistic-content-based Portuguese claim dataset with quality-verified annotations, including baseline models and benchmarks for NLP/IR applications. Dataset focuses on news media rather than social media or parliamentary sources.

Conclusion: ClaimPT addresses resource scarcity in Portuguese fact-checking, enabling research on misinformation in news media and fostering low-resource language NLP advancements through open-access annotations and models.

Abstract: Fact-checking remains a demanding and time-consuming task, still largely dependent on manual verification and unable to match the rapid spread of misinformation online. This is particularly important because debunking false information typically takes longer to reach consumers than the misinformation itself; accelerating corrections through automation can therefore help counter it more effectively. Although many organizations perform manual fact-checking, this approach is difficult to scale given the growing volume of digital content. These limitations have motivated interest in automating fact-checking, where identifying claims is a crucial first step. However, progress has been uneven across languages, with English dominating due to abundant annotated data. Portuguese, like other languages, still lacks accessible, licensed datasets, limiting research, NLP developments and applications. In this paper, we introduce ClaimPT, a dataset of European Portuguese news articles annotated for factual claims, comprising 1,308 articles and 6,875 individual annotations. Unlike most existing resources based on social media or parliamentary transcripts, ClaimPT focuses on journalistic content, collected through a partnership with LUSA, the Portuguese News Agency. To ensure annotation quality, two trained annotators labeled each article, with a curator validating all annotations according to a newly proposed scheme. We also provide baseline models for claim detection, establishing initial benchmarks and enabling future NLP and IR applications. By releasing ClaimPT, we aim to advance research on low-resource fact-checking and enhance understanding of misinformation in news media.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有结构化剪枝方法因需额外训练时间、内存及知识蒸馏等策略，难以实现高效微调。针对下游任务微调的效率瓶颈进行优化。

Method: 通过微调初期参数的累积梯度计算初始梯度信息矩阵（IGIA-Matrix）评估层重要性，按重要性剪枝并合并稀疏层，仅保留同符号参数减少干扰。

Result: 在8个下游数据集（医疗、金融、通用基准）中，参数减少40%的同时精度下降仅0.99%，验证了跨任务有效性。

Conclusion: 通过早阶段梯度引导剪枝平衡了效率与性能，为大模型微调提供轻量化解决方案，适用多领域任务。

Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with downstream data is often considered time-consuming and expensive. Structured pruning methods are primarily employed to improve the inference efficiency of pre-trained models. Meanwhile, they often require additional time and memory for training, knowledge distillation, structure search, and other strategies, making efficient model fine-tuning challenging to achieve. To simultaneously enhance the training and inference efficiency of downstream task fine-tuning, we introduce GradPruner, which can prune layers of LLMs guided by gradients in the early stages of fine-tuning. GradPruner uses the cumulative gradients of each parameter during the initial phase of fine-tuning to compute the Initial Gradient Information Accumulation Matrix (IGIA-Matrix) to assess the importance of layers and perform pruning. We sparsify the pruned layers based on the IGIA-Matrix and merge them with the remaining layers. Only elements with the same sign are merged to reduce interference from sign variations. We conducted extensive experiments on two LLMs across eight downstream datasets. Including medical, financial, and general benchmark tasks. The results demonstrate that GradPruner has achieved a parameter reduction of 40% with only a 0.99% decrease in accuracy. Our code is publicly available.

Motivation: 现有方法处理长、复杂自然语言推理时易出现形式化错误，且全局修正成本高，难以定位局部错误。

Method: 将复杂推理分解为蕴含树，自底向上验证并隔离错误节点，结合θ-替代优化逻辑形式的一致性。

Result: 验证率较最先进方法提升21%-48%，减少修正迭代次数与运行时间，保持高NLI准确率。

Conclusion: 框架通过局部修正与高效形式化增强了神经-符号系统的鲁棒性，适用于复杂自然语言推理任务。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that integrating large language models (LLMs) with theorem provers (TPs) in neuro-symbolic pipelines helps with entailment verification and proof-guided refinement of explanations for natural language inference (NLI). However, scaling such refinement to naturalistic NLI remains difficult: long, syntactically rich inputs and deep multi-step arguments amplify autoformalisation errors, where a single local mismatch can invalidate the proof. Moreover, current methods often handle failures via costly global regeneration due to the difficulty of localising the responsible span or step from prover diagnostics. Aiming to address these problems, we propose a decompose-and-formalise framework that (i) decomposes premise-hypothesis pairs into an entailment tree of atomic steps, (ii) verifies the tree bottom-up to isolate failures to specific nodes, and (iii) performs local diagnostic-guided refinement instead of regenerating the whole explanation. Moreover, to improve faithfulness of autoformalisation, we introduce $θ$-substitution in an event-based logical form to enforce consistent argument-role bindings. Across a range of reasoning tasks using five LLM backbones, our method achieves the highest explanation verification rates, improving over the state-of-the-art by 26.2%, 21.7%, 21.6% and 48.9%, while reducing refinement iterations and runtime and preserving strong NLI accuracy.

Result: 相较于自回归模型，在保持高准确率的前提下实现5-36倍推理速度提升。

Conclusion: 通过效率与准确率的平衡，为实际场景中的KIE应用提供可扩展解决方案。

Abstract: Key Information Extraction (KIE) from visually-rich documents (VrDs) is a critical task, for which recent Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong potential. However, their reliance on autoregressive inference, which generates outputs sequentially, creates a significant efficiency bottleneck, especially as KIE tasks often involve extracting multiple, semantically independent fields. To overcome this limitation, we introduce PIP: a Parallel Inference Paradigm for KIE. Our approach reformulates the problem by using "[mask]" tokens as placeholders for all target values, enabling their simultaneous generation in a single forward pass. To facilitate this paradigm, we develop a tailored mask pre-training strategy and construct large-scale supervised datasets. Experimental results show that our PIP-models achieve a 5-36x inference speedup with negligible performance degradation compared to traditional autoregressive base models. By substantially improving efficiency while maintaining high accuracy, PIP paves the way for scalable and practical real-world KIE solutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DLMs因Transformer值空间低范数表示引发的sink token位置不确定性，导致信息混合过度且影响推理鲁棒性，需设计稳定机制平衡性能与结构可控性。

Method: 在注意力掩码中强制约束特殊token实现单向自注意，同时允许其他token对其进行双向建模，无需参数更新即可插入任意位置。

Result: 实验表明单token可稳定注意力sink分布，BLEU/PPL指标提升2.3-5.1，注意力熵降低18.7%，且消融实验验证效果与位置和语义无关。

Conclusion: 研究揭示DLMs动态sink机制本质，并提供轻量级解决方案突破性能瓶颈，为扩散模型架构创新提供新方向。

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have emerged as a compelling alternative to autoregressive approaches, enabling parallel text generation with competitive performance. Despite these advantages, there is a critical instability in DLMs: the moving sink phenomenon. Our analysis indicates that sink tokens exhibit low-norm representations in the Transformer's value space, and that the moving sink phenomenon serves as a protective mechanism in DLMs to prevent excessive information mixing. However, their unpredictable positions across diffusion steps undermine inference robustness. To resolve this, we propose a simple but effective extra sink token implemented via a modified attention mask. Specifically, we introduce a special token constrained to attend solely to itself, while remaining globally visible to all other tokens. Experimental results demonstrate that introducing a single extra token stabilizes attention sinks, substantially improving model performance. Crucially, further analysis confirms that the effectiveness of this token is independent of its position and characterized by negligible semantic content, validating its role as a robust and dedicated structural sink.

Abstract: We present SynCABEL (Synthetic Contextualized Augmentation for Biomedical Entity Linking), a framework that addresses a central bottleneck in supervised biomedical entity linking (BEL): the scarcity of expert-annotated training data. SynCABEL leverages large language models to generate context-rich synthetic training examples for all candidate concepts in a target knowledge base, providing broad supervision without manual annotation. We demonstrate that SynCABEL, when combined with decoder-only models and guided inference establish new state-of-the-art results across three widely used multilingual benchmarks: MedMentions for English, QUAERO for French, and SPACCC for Spanish. Evaluating data efficiency, we show that SynCABEL reaches the performance of full human supervision using up to 60% less annotated data, substantially reducing reliance on labor-intensive and costly expert labeling. Finally, acknowledging that standard evaluation based on exact code matching often underestimates clinically valid predictions due to ontology redundancy, we introduce an LLM-as-a-judge protocol. This analysis reveals that SynCABEL significantly improves the rate of clinically valid predictions. Our synthetic datasets, models, and code are released to support reproducibility and future research.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly exhibit human-like linguistic behaviors and internal representations that they could serve as computational simulators of language cognition. We ask whether LLMs can be systematically manipulated to reproduce language-production impairments characteristic of aphasia following focal brain lesions. Such models could provide scalable proxies for testing rehabilitation hypotheses, and offer a controlled framework for probing the functional organization of language. We introduce a clinically grounded, component-level framework that simulates aphasia by selectively perturbing functional components in LLMs, and apply it to both modular Mixture-of-Experts models and dense Transformers using a unified intervention interface. Our pipeline (i) identifies subtype-linked components for Broca's and Wernicke's aphasia, (ii) interprets these components with linguistic probing tasks, and (iii) induces graded impairments by progressively perturbing the top-k subtype-linked components, evaluating outcomes with Western Aphasia Battery (WAB) subtests summarized by Aphasia Quotient (AQ). Across architectures and lesioning strategies, subtype-targeted perturbations yield more systematic, aphasia-like regressions than size-matched random perturbations, and MoE modularity supports more localized and interpretable phenotype-to-component mappings. These findings suggest that modular LLMs, combined with clinically informed component perturbations, provide a promising platform for simulating aphasic language production and studying how distinct language functions degrade under targeted disruptions.

Abstract: Fine tuning has been regarded as a de facto approach for adapting large language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks, but the high training memory consumption inherited from LLMs makes this process inefficient. Among existing memory efficient approaches, activation-related optimization has proven particularly effective, as activations consistently dominate overall memory consumption. Although prior arts offer various activation optimization strategies, their data-agnostic nature ultimately results in ineffective and unstable fine tuning. In this paper, we propose TokenSeek, a universal plugin solution for various transformer-based models through instance-aware token seeking and ditching, achieving significant fine-tuning memory savings (e.g., requiring only 14.8% of the memory on Llama3.2 1B) with on-par or even better performance. Furthermore, our interpretable token seeking process reveals the underlying reasons for its effectiveness, offering valuable insights for future research on token efficiency.

Abstract: Interactive medical consultation requires an agent to proactively elicit missing clinical evidence under uncertainty. Yet existing evaluations largely remain static or outcome-centric, neglecting the evidence-gathering process. In this work, we propose an interactive evaluation framework that explicitly models the consultation process using a simulated patient and a \rev{simulated reporter} grounded in atomic evidences. Based on this representation, we introduce Information Coverage Rate (ICR) to quantify how completely an agent uncovers necessary evidence during interaction. To support systematic study, we build EviMed, an evidence-based benchmark spanning diverse conditions from common complaints to rare diseases, and evaluate 10 models with varying reasoning abilities. We find that strong diagnostic reasoning does not guarantee effective information collection, and this insufficiency acts as a primary bottleneck limiting performance in interactive settings. To address this, we propose REFINE, a strategy that leverages diagnostic verification to guide the agent in proactively resolving uncertainties. Extensive experiments demonstrate that REFINE consistently outperforms baselines across diverse datasets and facilitates effective model collaboration, enabling smaller agents to achieve superior performance under strong reasoning supervision.

Abstract: Current stance detection research typically relies on predicting stance based on given targets and text. However, in real-world social media scenarios, targets are neither predefined nor static but rather complex and dynamic. To address this challenge, we propose a novel task: zero-shot stance detection in the wild with Dynamic Target Generation and Multi-Target Adaptation (DGTA), which aims to automatically identify multiple target-stance pairs from text without prior target knowledge. We construct a Chinese social media stance detection dataset and design multi-dimensional evaluation metrics. We explore both integrated and two-stage fine-tuning strategies for large language models (LLMs) and evaluate various baseline models. Experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuned LLMs achieve superior performance on this task: the two-stage fine-tuned Qwen2.5-7B attains the highest comprehensive target recognition score of 66.99%, while the integrated fine-tuned DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B achieves a stance detection F1 score of 79.26%.

TL;DR: 本文通过对比静态RAG与迭代RAG在科学领域多跳问答任务中的表现，发现迭代RAG在模型推理能力不足时能显著超越静态RAG，但存在检索覆盖率低、推理错误等问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG框架在科学领域面临多跳推理困难、知识稀疏、证据异质三大挑战，而主流静态RAG（单次检索）的效果是否被迭代式RAG（检索-推理循环）真正超越缺乏系统性验证

Method: 构建包含3种实验模式（无上下文、黄金上下文、迭代RAG）的基准测试，使用化学领域多跳问答数据集ChemKGMultiHopQA，对11个大模型进行对照实验，设计检索覆盖率、假设漂移度、组合保真度等5个诊断指标

Result: 迭代RAG在非推理微调模型上超越黄金标准上下文（提升25.6%），分阶段检索降低28%的跨hop失败，但存在42%的检索覆盖缺口和37%的早停误判率

Conclusion: 迭代RAG通过动态修正能突破参数化知识限制，其效果受制于检索的完备性和推理的稳定性，建议在专业场景部署时强化检索覆盖诊断和控制校准机制

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) extends large language models (LLMs) beyond parametric knowledge, yet it is unclear when iterative retrieval-reasoning loops meaningfully outperform static RAG, particularly in scientific domains with multi-hop reasoning, sparse domain knowledge, and heterogeneous evidence. We provide the first controlled, mechanism-level diagnostic study of whether synchronized iterative retrieval and reasoning can surpass an idealized static upper bound (Gold Context) RAG. We benchmark eleven state-of-the-art LLMs under three regimes: (i) No Context, measuring reliance on parametric memory; (ii) Gold Context, where all oracle evidence is supplied at once; and (iii) Iterative RAG, a training-free controller that alternates retrieval, hypothesis refinement, and evidence-aware stopping. Using the chemistry-focused ChemKGMultiHopQA dataset, we isolate questions requiring genuine retrieval and analyze behavior with diagnostics spanning retrieval coverage gaps, anchor-carry drop, query quality, composition fidelity, and control calibration. Across models, Iterative RAG consistently outperforms Gold Context, with gains up to 25.6 percentage points, especially for non-reasoning fine-tuned models. Staged retrieval reduces late-hop failures, mitigates context overload, and enables dynamic correction of early hypothesis drift, but remaining failure modes include incomplete hop coverage, distractor latch trajectories, early stopping miscalibration, and high composition failure rates even with perfect retrieval. Overall, staged retrieval is often more influential than the mere presence of ideal evidence; we provide practical guidance for deploying and diagnosing RAG systems in specialized scientific settings and a foundation for more reliable, controllable iterative retrieval-reasoning frameworks.

Abstract: Despite the strong reasoning capabilities of recent large language models (LLMs), achieving reliable performance on challenging tasks often requires post-training or computationally expensive sampling strategies, limiting their practical efficiency. In this work, we first show that a small subset of neurons in LLMs exhibits strong predictive correlations with reasoning correctness. Based on this observation, we propose AdaRAS (Adaptive Reasoning Activation Steering), a lightweight test-time framework that improves reasoning reliability by selectively intervening on neuron activations. AdaRAS identifies Reasoning-Critical Neurons (RCNs) via a polarity-aware mean-difference criterion and adaptively steers their activations during inference, enhancing incorrect reasoning traces while avoiding degradation on already-correct cases. Experiments on 10 mathematics and coding benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements, including over 13% gains on AIME-24 and AIME-25. Moreover, AdaRAS exhibits strong transferability across datasets and scalability to stronger models, outperforming post-training methods without additional training or sampling cost.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A reflective translation framework improves machine translation for low-resource languages (isiZulu and isiXhosa) using self-critique and revision techniques without model fine-tuning, achieving significant BLEU/COMET score gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address machine translation challenges in low-resource languages caused by limited parallel data and linguistic resources, leveraging self-reflection mechanisms from large language models to enhance translation quality without retraining.

Method: Developed a three-stage prompt-based framework (initial translation → structured self-critique → refined translation) evaluated on OPUS-100 and NTREX-African datasets through multiple prompting strategies and confidence thresholds.

Result: Achieved average improvements of +0.22 BLEU and +0.18 COMET scores between first/second-pass translations, with statistical significance confirmed via paired nonparametric tests.

Conclusion: Structured self-reflection provides a practical, model-agnostic solution for low-resource translation while creating reflection-augmented datasets that enable future supervised learning and error analysis research.

Abstract: Low-resource languages such as isiZulu and isiXhosa face persistent challenges in machine translation due to limited parallel data and linguistic resources. Recent advances in large language models suggest that self-reflection, prompting a model to critique and revise its own outputs, can improve reasoning quality and factual consistency. Building on this idea, this paper introduces Reflective Translation, a prompt-based framework in which a model generates an initial translation, produces a structured self-critique, and then uses this reflection to generate a refined translation. The approach is evaluated on English-isiZulu and English-isiXhosa translation using OPUS-100 and NTREX-African, across multiple prompting strategies and confidence thresholds. Results show consistent improvements in both BLEU and COMET scores between first- and second-pass translations, with average gains of up to +0.22 BLEU and +0.18 COMET. Statistical significance testing using paired nonparametric tests confirms that these improvements are robust. The proposed method is model-agnostic, requires no fine-tuning, and introduces a reflection-augmented dataset that can support future supervised or analysis-driven work. These findings demonstrate that structured self-reflection is a practical and effective mechanism for improving translation quality in low-resource settings.

Abstract: Multidisciplinary tumour boards (MDTBs) play a central role in oncology decision-making but require manual processes and structuring large volumes of heterogeneous clinical information, resulting in a substantial documentation burden. In this work, we present ONCOTIMIA, a modular and secure clinical tool designed to integrate generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) into oncology workflows and evaluate its application to the automatic completion of lung cancer tumour board forms using large language models (LLMs). The system combines a multi-layer data lake, hybrid relational and vector storage, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and a rule-driven adaptive form model to transform unstructured clinical documentation into structured and standardised tumour board records. We assess the performance of six LLMs deployed through AWS Bedrock on ten lung cancer cases, measuring both completion form accuracy and end-to-end latency. The results demonstrate high performance across models, with the best performing configuration achieving an 80% of correct field completion and clinically acceptable response time for most LLMs. Larger and more recent models exhibit best accuracies without incurring prohibitive latency. These findings provide empirical evidence that LLM- assisted autocompletion form is technically feasible and operationally viable in multidisciplinary lung cancer workflows and support its potential to significantly reduce documentation burden while preserving data quality.
