State-of-the-art approaches decompose the task into a lifting of atomic propositions (APs) phase and a translation phase. However, existing methods struggle with accurate lifting, the existence of co-references, and learning from limited data. In this paper, we propose a framework for NL to TL translation called Grammar Forced Translation (GraFT). The framework is based on the observation that previous work solves both the lifting and translation steps by letting a language model iteratively predict tokens from its full vocabulary. In contrast, GraFT reduces the complexity of both tasks by restricting the set of valid output tokens from the full vocabulary to only a handful in each step. The solution space reduction is obtained by exploiting the unique properties of each problem. We also provide a theoretical justification for why the solution space reduction leads to more efficient learning. We evaluate the effectiveness of GraFT using the CW, GLTL, and Navi benchmarks. Compared with state-of-the-art translation approaches, it can be observed that GraFT the end-to-end translation accuracy by 5.49% and out-of-domain translation accuracy by 14.06% on average.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper proposes GraFT, a framework for translating natural language to temporal logic by reducing token prediction complexity through restricted output token sets, achieving higher accuracy than existing methods.", "motivation": "Existing methods face challenges in atomic proposition lifting, co-reference handling, and limited data learning.

Characterizing How Meaningful Information is Distributed Across Multiple Channels", "comment": null, "summary": "Prosody -- the melody of speech -- conveys critical information often not captured by the words or text of a message. In this paper, we propose an information-theoretic approach to quantify how much information is expressed by prosody alone and not by text, and crucially, what that information is about. Our approach applies large speech and language models to estimate the mutual information between a particular dimension of an utterance's meaning (e.g., its emotion) and any of its communication channels (e.g., audio or text). We then use this approach to quantify how much information is conveyed by audio and text about sarcasm, emotion, and questionhood, using speech from television and podcasts. We find that for sarcasm and emotion the audio channel -- and by implication the prosodic channel -- transmits over an order of magnitude more information about these features than the text channel alone, at least when long-term context beyond the current sentence is unavailable. For questionhood, prosody provides comparatively less additional information.

While existing caching mechanisms,such as token-level key-value caches, offer speedups in autore-gressive decoding, they are limited in scope and applicability. In this paper, we present LLMCache, a novel layer-wise caching framework that accelerates transformer inference by reusing intermediate activations based on semantic similarity of input sequences. Unlike prior work, LLMCache is model-agnostic,operates across both encoder and decoder architectures, and supports caching at arbitrary transformer layers. We introduce a lightweight fingerprinting mechanism for matching seman-tically similar inputs and propose adaptive eviction strategies to manage cache staleness. Experiments on BERT and GPT-2 across SQuAD, WikiText-103, and OpenBookQA show up to 3.1 X speedup in inference time with <0.5% accuracy degradation.

While prior work has found that transformers develop geometric embeddings that mirror algebraic structure, those previous findings emerge from settings where arithmetic-valued tokens have fixed meanings. We devise a new task in which the assignment of symbols to specific algebraic group elements varies from one sequence to another. Despite this challenging setup, transformers achieve near-perfect accuracy on the task and even generalize to unseen algebraic groups. We develop targeted data distributions to create causal tests of a set of hypothesized mechanisms, and we isolate three mechanisms models consistently learn: commutative copying where a dedicated head copies answers, identity element recognition that distinguishes identity-containing facts, and closure-based cancellation that tracks group membership to constrain valid answers. Complementary to the geometric representations found in fixed-symbol settings, our findings show that models develop symbolic reasoning mechanisms when trained to reason in-context with variables whose meanings are not fixed.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76Transformer\u5728\u7b26\u53f7\u53ef\u53d8\u7684\u4ee3\u6570\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5982\u4f55\u53d1\u5c55\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u7b26\u53f7\u610f\u4e49\u4e0d\u56fa\u5b9a\u4e5f\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u8de8\u7fa4\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u793aTransformer\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u7b26\u53f7\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u91c7\u7528\u51e0\u4f55\u5d4c\u5165\u53cd\u6620\u4ee3\u6570\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4f46\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7b26\u53f7\u610f\u4e49\u4f1a\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7b26\u53f7\u53ef\u53d8\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u52a8\u6001\u7b26\u53f7-\u4ee3\u6570\u7fa4\u6620\u5c04\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u8fdb\u884c\u56e0\u679c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5206\u79bb\u51fa\u4e09\u79cd\u6838\u5fc3\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u53ef\u4ea4\u6362\u590d\u5236\u3001\u5355\u4f4d\u5143\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u95ed\u5305\u6d88\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u8fbe\u5230\u63a5\u8fd1\u5b8c\u7f8e\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u672a\u77e5\u4ee3\u6570\u7fa4\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u51fa\u4e09\u4e2a\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e60\u5f97\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u4e13\u7528\u5934\u7684\u590d\u5236\u64cd\u4f5c\u3001\u8bc6\u522b\u5355\u4f4d\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u533a\u5206\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u95ed\u5305\u7684\u7fa4\u6210\u5458\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53d1\u73b0Transformer\u5728\u53ef\u53d8\u7b26\u53f7\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u53d1\u5c55\u51fa\u7b26\u53f7\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4e0e\u56fa\u5b9a\u7b26\u53f7\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u8868\u5f81\u5f62\u6210\u4e92\u8865\uff0c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u5907\u52a8\u6001\u8bed\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u62bd\u8c61\u4ee3\u6570\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Two distinct datasets were employed for training and evaluation, yielding notable findings. The YOLOv8 Nano variant demonstrated a precision of 0.964 and mAP50 of 0.918 on the LPR task, while the YOLOv8 Small variant exhibited a precision of 0.92 and mAP50 of 0.91 on the Character Recognition task. A custom method for character sequencing was introduced, effectively sequencing the detected characters based on their x-axis positions. An optimized pipeline, utilizing YOLOv8 Nano for LPR and YOLOv8 Small for Character Recognition, is proposed.

However, current state-of-the-art (SOTA) systems - such as Multimodal AI for Radiology Applications (MAIRA-2) and Medical Pathways Language Model-Multimodal (MedPaLM-M) - depend on large-scale multimodal training, clinical metadata, and multiple imaging views, making them resource-intensive and inaccessible for most settings. We introduce a compact image-to-text architecture that generates the Findings section of chest X-ray reports from a single frontal image. The model combines a frozen Self-Distillation with No Labels v3 (DINOv3) Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder with a Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2 (GPT-2) decoder enhanced by layer-wise anatomical attention. This mechanism integrates lung and heart segmentation masks through hierarchical Gaussian smoothing, biasing attention toward clinically relevant regions without adding trainable parameters. Evaluated on the official Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-Chest X-ray (MIMIC-CXR) dataset using Chest Radiograph Expert (CheXpert) and Radiology Graph (RadGraph) metrics, our approach achieved substantial gains: CheXpert Macro-F1 for five key pathologies increased by 168% (0.083 -> 0.238) and Micro-F1 by 146% (0.137 -> 0.337), while broader performance across 14 observations improved by 86% (0.170 -> 0.316). Structural coherence also improved, with RadGraph F1 rising by 9.7%. Despite its small size and purely image-conditioned design, the model demonstrates that decoder-level anatomical guidance improves spatial grounding and enhances coherence in clinically relevant regions.

Robust wearable tactile sensors are scarce, and no existing in-the-wild datasets align first-person video with full-hand touch. To bridge the gap between visual perception and physical interaction, we present OpenTouch, the first in-the-wild egocentric full-hand tactile dataset, containing 5.1 hours of synchronized video-touch-pose data and 2,900 curated clips with detailed text annotations. Using OpenTouch, we introduce retrieval and classification benchmarks that probe how touch grounds perception and action. We show that tactile signals provide a compact yet powerful cue for grasp understanding, strengthen cross-modal alignment, and can be reliably retrieved from in-the-wild video queries. By releasing this annotated vision-touch-pose dataset and benchmark, we aim to advance multimodal egocentric perception, embodied learning, and contact-rich robotic manipulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86OpenTouch\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u91ce\u5916\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u79f0\u5168\u624b\u89e6\u89c9\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u5f25\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u5f0f\u89e6\u89c9\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7a00\u5c11\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5c06\u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u79f0\u89c6\u9891\u4e0e\u5168\u624b\u89e6\u89c9\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u63a5\u89e6\u884c\u4e3a\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b5.1\u5c0f\u65f6\u540c\u6b65\u89c6\u9891-\u89e6\u89c9-\u59ff\u6001\u6570\u636e\u53ca2900\u4e2a\u8be6\u7ec6\u6807\u6ce8\u7247\u6bb5\u7684OpenTouch\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u89e6\u89c9\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u89e6\u89c9\u4fe1\u53f7\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7d27\u51d1\u4f46\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6293\u53d6\u7406\u89e3\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u4ece\u672a\u526a\u8f91\u89c6\u9891\u67e5\u8be2\u4e2d\u53ef\u9760\u68c0\u7d22\u89e6\u89c9\u6570\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u53d1\u5e03OpenTouch\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u63a8\u52a8\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u81ea\u6211\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u5177\u8eab\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u63a5\u89e6\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

We argue that satisfying these constraints can lead to benchmark drift over time, where the static benchmark judges fail to keep up with newer model capabilities. We show that benchmark drift is a significant problem for GenEval, one of the most popular T2I benchmarks. Although GenEval was well-aligned with human judgment at the time of its release, it has drifted far from human judgment over time -- resulting in an absolute error of as much as 17.7% for current models. This level of drift strongly suggests that GenEval has been saturated for some time, as we verify via a large-scale human study. To help fill this benchmarking gap, we introduce a new benchmark, GenEval 2, with improved coverage of primitive visual concepts and higher degrees of compositionality, which we show is more challenging for current models. We also introduce Soft-TIFA, an evaluation method for GenEval 2 that combines judgments for visual primitives, which we show is more well-aligned with human judgment and argue is less likely to drift from human-alignment over time (as compared to more holistic judges such as VQAScore). Although we hope GenEval 2 will provide a strong benchmark for many years, avoiding benchmark drift is far from guaranteed and our work, more generally, highlights the importance of continual audits and improvement for T2I and related automated model evaluation benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\uff08T2I\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6GenEval\u56e0'\u57fa\u51c6\u6f02\u79fb'\u95ee\u9898\u5bfc\u81f4\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bef\u5dee\u9ad8\u8fbe17.7%\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\u57fa\u51c6GenEval 2\u53ca\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5Soft-TIFA\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u5f3a\u89c6\u89c9\u6982\u5ff5\u8986\u76d6\u5ea6\u548c\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u8bc4\u4f30\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u5316T2I\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b58\u5728\u53cc\u91cd\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u9700\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6d4b\u8bd5\u63d0\u793a\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u4e14\u4e0e\u8bc4\u5206\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u800cGenEval\u57fa\u51c6\u56e0\u6280\u672f\u8fdb\u6b65\u5df2\u4e25\u91cd\u504f\u79bb\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\uff0817.7%\u7edd\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\uff09\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bc4\u4f30\u5931\u6548\u3002\u9700\u8981\u6784\u5efa\u65b0\u4e00\u4ee3\u52a8\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGenEval 2\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5f3a\u5316\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u5355\u5143\u8986\u76d6\u5ea6\u4e0e\u590d\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u751f\u6210\u96be\u5ea6\uff1b\u5f00\u53d1Soft-TIFA\u8bc4\u4f30\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u5355\u5143\u8bc4\u5206\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u4e0eVQAScore\u7b49\u5168\u5c40\u8bc4\u5206\u6a21\u578b\u5f62\u6210\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "GenEval 2\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8bc4\u4f30\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0cSoft-TIFA\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff08r=0.82\uff09\u4f18\u4e8eVQAScore\uff08r=0.67\uff09\uff1b\u5386\u53f2\u9a8c\u8bc1\u663e\u793aGenEval\u57282023\u5e74\u5df2\u51fa\u73b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u9971\u548c\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5f97\u5206\u63a5\u8fd1\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u51c6\u6f02\u79fb\u662f\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\uff0cGenEval 2\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u89c6\u89c9\u6982\u5ff5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bc4\u5206\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u957f\u671f\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f53\u7cfb\u9700\u6301\u7eed\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

The planner decomposes instructions via step-by-step reasoning and explicitly grounds them to target regions; the editor then applies changes using a training-free attention-region injection mechanism, enabling precise, parallel multi-region edits without iterative inpainting. To strengthen planning, we apply GRPO-based reinforcement learning using 1K instruction-only examples, yielding substantial gains in reasoning fidelity and format reliability. We further present IV-Edit, a benchmark focused on fine-grained grounding and knowledge-intensive edits.

Lensch"], "title": "Memory-Enhanced SAM3 for Occlusion-Robust Surgical Instrument Segmentation", "comment": "Under Review", "summary": "Accurate surgical instrument segmentation in endoscopic videos is crucial for computer-assisted interventions, yet remains challenging due to frequent occlusions, rapid motion, specular artefacts, and long-term instrument re-entry. While SAM3 provides a powerful spatio-temporal framework for video object segmentation, its performance in surgical scenes is limited by indiscriminate memory updates, fixed memory capacity, and weak identity recovery after occlusions. We propose ReMeDI-SAM3, a training-free memory-enhanced extension of SAM3, that addresses these limitations through three components: (i) relevance-aware memory filtering with a dedicated occlusion-aware memory for storing pre-occlusion frames, (ii) a piecewise interpolation scheme that expands the effective memory capacity, and (iii) a feature-based re-identification module with temporal voting for reliable post-occlusion identity disambiguation. Together, these components mitigate error accumulation and enable reliable recovery after occlusions. Evaluations on EndoVis17 and EndoVis18 under a zero-shot setting show absolute mcIoU improvements of around 7% and 16%, respectively, over vanilla SAM3, outperforming even prior training-based approaches.

Existing methods for estimating such physical material parameters from visual data assume homogeneous single-material objects, pre-learned dynamics, or simplistic topologies. Real-world objects, however, are often complex in material composition and geometry lying outside the realm of these assumptions. In this paper, we particularly focus on flowers as a representative common object. We introduce Multi-material Physical Gaussians (M-PhyGs) to estimate the material composition and parameters of such multi-material complex natural objects from video. From a short video captured in a natural setting, M-PhyGs jointly segments the object into similar materials and recovers their continuum mechanical parameters while accounting for gravity. M-PhyGs achieves this efficiently with newly introduced cascaded 3D and 2D losses, and by leveraging temporal mini-batching. We introduce a dataset, Phlowers, of people interacting with flowers as a novel platform to evaluate the accuracy of this challenging task of multi-material physical parameter estimation.

This paper presents FlashPortrait, an end-to-end video diffusion transformer capable of synthesizing ID-preserving, infinite-length videos while achieving up to 6x acceleration in inference speed. In particular, FlashPortrait begins by computing the identity-agnostic facial expression features with an off-the-shelf extractor. It then introduces a Normalized Facial Expression Block to align facial features with diffusion latents by normalizing them with their respective means and variances, thereby improving identity stability in facial modeling. During inference, FlashPortrait adopts a dynamic sliding-window scheme with weighted blending in overlapping areas, ensuring smooth transitions and ID consistency in long animations. In each context window, based on the latent variation rate at particular timesteps and the derivative magnitude ratio among diffusion layers, FlashPortrait utilizes higher-order latent derivatives at the current timestep to directly predict latents at future timesteps, thereby skipping several denoising steps and achieving 6x speed acceleration. Experiments on benchmarks show the effectiveness of FlashPortrait both qualitatively and quantitatively.", "AI": {"tldr": "FlashPortrait \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563 Transformer\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u8868\u60c5\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8eab\u4efd\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u65e0\u9650\u89c6\u9891\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6 6 \u500d\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u957f\u7ad6\u7248\u8096\u50cf\u52a8\u753b\u4e2d\u8eab\u4efd\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u957f\u8096\u50cf\u52a8\u753b\u52a0\u901f\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u7ef4\u6301\u8eab\u4efd\uff08ID\uff09\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u8eab\u4efd\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "1. \u4f7f\u7528\u73b0\u6210\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0e\u8eab\u4efd\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u9762\u90e8\u8868\u60c5\u7279\u5f81\uff1b2. \u5f15\u5165\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u9762\u90e8\u8868\u60c5\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u5747\u503c\u65b9\u5dee\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u4ee5\u5bf9\u9f50\u6269\u6563\u6f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\uff09\uff1b3. \u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u91c7\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u52a0\u6743\u878d\u5408\u6280\u672f\uff1b4. \u5229\u7528\u5f53\u524d\u65f6\u6bb5\u6f5c\u53d8\u91cf\u9ad8\u9636\u5bfc\u6570\u76f4\u63a5\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u6f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u8df3\u8fc7\u90e8\u5206\u53bb\u566a\u6b65\u9aa4\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347 6 \u500d\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b9a\u91cf\u4e0e\u5b9a\u6027\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5747\u8868\u660e\u5176\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u957f\u52a8\u753b\u4e2d\u8eab\u4efd\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u8fc7\u6e21\u5e73\u6ed1\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u4f18\u5316\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u521b\u65b0\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u52a0\u901f\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4e3a\u957f\u8096\u50cf\u52a8\u753b\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

To address this generalization gap, we propose VIVA, a scalable framework for instruction-based video editing that leverages VLM-guided encoding and reward optimization.

Second, we propose a post-training stage, Edit-GRPO, which adapts Group Relative Policy Optimization to the domain of video editing, directly optimizing the model for instruction-faithful, content-preserving, and aesthetically pleasing edits using relative rewards. Furthermore, we propose a data construction pipeline designed to synthetically generate diverse, high-fidelity paired video-instruction data of basic editing operations.

This requires a compact, semantically rich scene representation that captures where objects are, how they function, and which parts are actionable. Scene graphs are a natural choice, yet prior work often separates spatial and functional relations, treats scenes as static snapshots without object states or temporal updates, and overlooks information most relevant for accomplishing the current task. To address these limitations, we introduce MomaGraph, a unified scene representation for embodied agents that integrates spatial-functional relationships and part-level interactive elements. However, advancing such a representation requires both suitable data and rigorous evaluation, which have been largely missing. We thus contribute MomaGraph-Scenes, the first large-scale dataset of richly annotated, task-driven scene graphs in household environments, along with MomaGraph-Bench, a systematic evaluation suite spanning six reasoning capabilities from high-level planning to fine-grained scene understanding. Built upon this foundation, we further develop MomaGraph-R1, a 7B vision-language model trained with reinforcement learning on MomaGraph-Scenes. MomaGraph-R1 predicts task-oriented scene graphs and serves as a zero-shot task planner under a Graph-then-Plan framework.

However, producing 3D videos remains costly and complex, while automatic Monocular-to-Stereo conversion is hindered by the limitations of the multi-stage ``Depth-Warp-Inpaint'' (DWI) pipeline. This paradigm suffers from error propagation, depth ambiguity, and format inconsistency between parallel and converged stereo configurations. To address these challenges, we introduce UniStereo, the first large-scale unified dataset for stereo video conversion, covering both stereo formats to enable fair benchmarking and robust model training. Building upon this dataset, we propose StereoPilot, an efficient feed-forward model that directly synthesizes the target view without relying on explicit depth maps or iterative diffusion sampling.

However, existing open-source models often exhibit blind tool-use reasoning patterns, invoking vision tools even when they are unnecessary, which significantly increases inference overhead and degrades model performance. To this end, we propose AdaTooler-V, an MLLM that performs adaptive tool-use by determining whether a visual problem truly requires tools. First, we introduce AT-GRPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm that adaptively adjusts reward scales based on the Tool Benefit Score of each sample, encouraging the model to invoke tools only when they provide genuine improvements. Moreover, we construct two datasets to support training: AdaTooler-V-CoT-100k for SFT cold start and AdaTooler-V-300k for RL with verifiable rewards across single-image, multi-image, and video data. Experiments across twelve benchmarks demonstrate the strong reasoning capability of AdaTooler-V, outperforming existing methods in diverse visual reasoning tasks.

We study the design space of data, architecture, and control, and introduce \\emph{EasyV2V}, a simple and effective framework for instruction-based video editing. On the data side, we compose existing experts with fast inverses to build diverse video pairs, lift image edit pairs into videos via single-frame supervision and pseudo pairs with shared affine motion, mine dense-captioned clips for video pairs, and add transition supervision to teach how edits unfold. On the model side, we observe that pretrained text-to-video models possess editing capability, motivating a simplified design. Simple sequence concatenation for conditioning with light LoRA fine-tuning suffices to train a strong model. For control, we unify spatiotemporal control via a single mask mechanism and support optional reference images.

Instead of training models to output features for downstream use, we train them to generate embeddings to perform predictive tasks directly. This work explores such a shift from learning representations to learning models. Specifically, models learn to predict future patch embeddings conditioned on past ones, using causal masking and stop gradient, which we refer to as Next-Embedding Predictive Autoregression (NEPA). We demonstrate that a simple Transformer pretrained on ImageNet-1k with next embedding prediction as its sole learning objective is effective - no pixel reconstruction, discrete tokens, contrastive loss, or task-specific heads. This formulation retains architectural simplicity and scalability, without requiring additional design complexity. NEPA achieves strong results across tasks, attaining 83.8% and 85.3% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K with ViT-B and ViT-L backbones after fine-tuning, and transferring effectively to semantic segmentation on ADE20K.

Single-image refocusing is still difficult. It involves recovering sharp content and creating realistic bokeh. Current methods have significant drawbacks. They need all-in-focus inputs, depend on synthetic data from simulators, and have limited control over aperture. We introduce Generative Refocusing, a two-step process that uses DeblurNet to recover all-in-focus images from various inputs and BokehNet for creating controllable bokeh. Our main innovation is semi-supervised training. This method combines synthetic paired data with unpaired real bokeh images, using EXIF metadata to capture real optical characteristics beyond what simulators can provide. Our experiments show we achieve top performance in defocus deblurring, bokeh synthesis, and refocusing benchmarks. Additionally, our Generative Refocusing allows text-guided adjustments and custom aperture shapes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5355\u56fe\u91cd\u6784\u6563\u666f\u4e0e\u53bb\u6a21\u7cca\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u573a\u63a7\u5236\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6444\u5f71\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u5355\u56fe\u91cd\u6784\u6280\u672f\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u5168\u7126\u8f93\u5165\u3001\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e14\u63a7\u5236\u5149\u5708\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u91cd\u6784\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1) DeblurNet \u4ece\u591a\u6837\u8f93\u5165\u6062\u590d\u5168\u7126\u56fe\u50cf\uff1b2) BokehNet \u751f\u6210\u53ef\u63a7\u6563\u666f\u3002\u7ed3\u5408\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u5408\u6210\u914d\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u672a\u914d\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u6563\u666f\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528EXIF\u5143\u6570\u636e\u6355\u6349\u771f\u5b9e\u5149\u5b66\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5728\u6563\u666f\u5408\u6210\u3001\u53bb\u6a21\u7cca\u4e0e\u91cd\u6784\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u6587\u672c\u5f15\u5bfc\u8c03\u6574\u53ca\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u5149\u5708\u5f62\u72b6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u514b\u670d\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u6563\u666f\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u7075\u6d3b\u63a7\u5236\u3002"}}

Unlike text-only approaches and existing trajectory-controlled image-to-video methods, our multimodal approach combines trajectories -- encoding motion, timing, and visibility -- with natural language for semantic intent and reference images for visual grounding of object identity, enabling the generation of coherent, controllable events that include multi-agent interactions, object entry/exit, reference-guided appearance and counterintuitive events. The resulting videos demonstrate not only temporal coherence but also emergent consistency, preserving object identity and scene despite temporary disappearance.
