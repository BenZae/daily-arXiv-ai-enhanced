### [1] [Bi-Orthogonal Factor Decomposition for Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05328)
*Fenil R. Doshi,Thomas Fel,Talia Konkle,George Alvarez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出Bi-orthogonal Factor Decomposition（BFD）框架，揭示视觉Transformer中注意力机制的信息交互模式，发现内容交互主导注意力能量，DINOv2模型具有更强的位置-内容协同能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管自注意力机制是视觉Transformer的核心，但缺乏对查询/键交互信息类型（位置/内容）的系统解析方法，现有注意力图仅反映权重分布，无法区分信息维度。

Method: BFD框架分两阶段：1) 基于ANOVA的正交分解将token激活值解耦为位置与内容因素；2) 对QK^T矩阵进行奇异值分解（SVD），提取双正交模态以揭示信息传递路径。

Result: 1) 内容-内容交互占主导，DINOv2比监督模型分配更多能量至内容-位置交互；2) 注意力头呈现功能分化：内容-内容/内容-位置/位置-位置交互类型；3) DINOv2中间层兼具位置结构保持与语义内容增强能力。

Conclusion: BFD为分析视觉Transformer提供了可解释框架，揭示注意力机制中位置与内容信息的协作模式，为模型优化提供理论依据。

Abstract: Self-attention is the central computational primitive of Vision Transformers, yet we lack a principled understanding of what information attention mechanisms exchange between tokens. Attention maps describe where weight mass concentrates; they do not reveal whether queries and keys trade position, content, or both. We introduce Bi-orthogonal Factor Decomposition (BFD), a two-stage analytical framework: first, an ANOVA-based decomposition statistically disentangles token activations into orthogonal positional and content factors; second, SVD of the query-key interaction matrix QK^T exposes bi-orthogonal modes that reveal how these factors mediate communication. After validating proper isolation of position and content, we apply BFD to state-of-the-art vision models and uncover three phenomena.(i) Attention operates primarily through content. Content-content interactions dominate attention energy, followed by content-position coupling. DINOv2 allocates more energy to content-position than supervised models and distributes computation across a richer mode spectrum. (ii) Attention mechanisms exhibit specialization: heads differentiate into content-content, content-position, and position-position operators, while singular modes within heads show analogous specialization. (iii) DINOv2's superior holistic shape processing emerges from intermediate layers that simultaneously preserve positional structure while contextually enriching semantic content.
  Overall, BFD exposes how tokens interact through attention and which informational factors - positional or semantic - mediate their communication, yielding practical insights into vision transformer mechanisms.

### [2] [Coding the Visual World: From Image to Simulation Using Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05344)
*Sagi Eppel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper uses the Im2Sim methodology to evaluate Vision Language Models (VLMs) in constructing simulation code from images of real-world systems (e.g., cities, clouds, vegetation) and compares synthetic outputs to originals, revealing VLMs' strengths in high-level system understanding but weaknesses in low-level detail replication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to assess whether VLMs can form structured mental models of visual systems by translating images into executable simulations, addressing a gap in evaluating deeper visual understanding beyond surface-level pattern recognition.

Method: Images of complex systems (e.g., waves, cities) were input to VLMs (GPT, Gemini) to generate system descriptions and simulation code. The code was executed to create synthetic images, which were quantitatively and qualitatively compared to original images to evaluate model performance.

Result: Top VLMs demonstrated strong capabilities in simulating high-level structures (e.g., urban layouts, cloud formations) across diverse domains but showed limitations in capturing fine-grained details (e.g., textural patterns, local object arrangements).

Conclusion: VLMs possess asymmetric visual understanding: robust high-level system modeling combined with superficial perception of low-level visual specifics, suggesting architectural tradeoffs between abstraction and detail encoding.

Abstract: The ability to construct mental models of the world is a central aspect of understanding. Similarly, visual understanding can be viewed as the ability to construct a representative model of the system depicted in an image. This work explores the capacity of Vision Language Models (VLMs) to recognize and simulate the systems and mechanisms depicted in images using the Im2Sim methodology. The VLM is given a natural image of a real-world system (e.g., cities, clouds, vegetation) and is tasked with describing the system and writing code that simulates and generates it. This generative code is then executed to produce a synthetic image, which is compared against the original. This approach is tested on various complex emergent systems, ranging from physical systems (waves, lights, clouds) to vegetation, cities, materials, and geological formations. Through analysis of the models and images generated by the VLMs, we examine their understanding of the systems in images. The results show that leading VLMs (GPT, Gemini) demonstrate the capacity to understand and model complex, multi-component systems across multiple layers of abstraction and a wide range of domains. At the same time, the VLMs exhibit limited ability to replicate fine details and low-level arrangements of patterns in the image. These findings reveal an interesting asymmetry: VLMs combine high-level, deep visual understanding of images with limited perception of fine details.

### [3] [MOSAIC-GS: Monocular Scene Reconstruction via Advanced Initialization for Complex Dynamic Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05368)
*Svitlana Morkva,Maximum Wilder-Smith,Michael Oechsle,Alessio Tonioni,Marco Hutter,Vaishakh Patil*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MOSAIC-GS通过单目视频实现高效的动态场景重建，结合多种几何线索与时间依赖曲线优化运动编码，平衡了速度与精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单目视频动态重建因缺乏多视角约束导致几何与时间一致性难恢复，现有方法运动推断易模糊且计算成本高。

Method: 1) 利用深度、光流、分割和点跟踪等几何线索结合刚性约束，在初始化阶段估计场景动态；2) 场景分解为动静成分，动态部分钟氏高斯轨迹由时变的傅里叶曲线编码；3) 减少对视觉外观的依赖以提升鲁棒性。

Result: 在标准基准中，优化速度与渲染效率超越现有方法，重建质量与SOTA方法相当。

Conclusion: MOSAIC-GS通过联合几何线索与参数高效运动建模，解决了单目动态重建中的模糊性问题，兼顾实时性与高质量。

Abstract: We present MOSAIC-GS, a novel, fully explicit, and computationally efficient approach for high-fidelity dynamic scene reconstruction from monocular videos using Gaussian Splatting. Monocular reconstruction is inherently ill-posed due to the lack of sufficient multiview constraints, making accurate recovery of object geometry and temporal coherence particularly challenging. To address this, we leverage multiple geometric cues, such as depth, optical flow, dynamic object segmentation, and point tracking. Combined with rigidity-based motion constraints, these cues allow us to estimate preliminary 3D scene dynamics during an initialization stage. Recovering scene dynamics prior to the photometric optimization reduces reliance on motion inference from visual appearance alone, which is often ambiguous in monocular settings. To enable compact representations, fast training, and real-time rendering while supporting non-rigid deformations, the scene is decomposed into static and dynamic components. Each Gaussian in the dynamic part of the scene is assigned a trajectory represented as time-dependent Poly-Fourier curve for parameter-efficient motion encoding. We demonstrate that MOSAIC-GS achieves substantially faster optimization and rendering compared to existing methods, while maintaining reconstruction quality on par with state-of-the-art approaches across standard monocular dynamic scene benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 集成深度学习和放射组学预测的模型在乳腺癌筛查中表现最佳，AUC达0.87，优于单独使用的深度学习（0.83）和放射组学（0.80）模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳腺癌的早期诊断对提高生存率至关重要，放射组学和深度学习虽具潜力，但整合方法的效能尚未明确。本文旨在系统评估单一方法及集成方法在筛查性乳腺X线摄影中的诊断性能差异。

Method: 基于RSNA 2023数据集（11,913例）训练ConvNeXtV1-small深度学习模型，并在TecSalud独立数据集（19,400例）验证；放射组学模型采用TecSalud数据开发并进行逐年留出验证；集成方法统一组合并校准两者的预测结果。

Result: 深度学习模型AUC为0.83，放射组学AUC为0.80，集成方法通过联合预测将AUC提升至0.87，且一致性校准效果更优。

Conclusion: 整合深度学习与放射组学的集成方法能显著提升筛查性乳腺X线摄影的乳腺癌诊断效能，其决策可靠性优于单一模型。

Abstract: Early diagnosis of breast cancer is crucial for improving survival rates. Radiomics and deep learning (DL) have shown significant potential in assisting radiologists with early cancer detection. This paper aims to critically assess the performance of radiomics, DL, and ensemble techniques in detecting cancer from screening mammograms. Two independent datasets were used: the RSNA 2023 Breast Cancer Detection Challenge (11,913 patients) and a Mexican cohort from the TecSalud dataset (19,400 patients). The ConvNeXtV1-small DL model was trained on the RSNA dataset and validated on the TecSalud dataset, while radiomics models were developed using the TecSalud dataset and validated with a leave-one-year-out approach. The ensemble method consistently combined and calibrated predictions using the same methodology. Results showed that the ensemble approach achieved the highest area under the curve (AUC) of 0.87, compared to 0.83 for ConvNeXtV1-small and 0.80 for radiomics. In conclusion, ensemble methods combining DL and radiomics predictions significantly enhance breast cancer diagnosis from mammograms.

### [5] [Sketch&Patch++: Efficient Structure-Aware 3D Gaussian Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05394)
*Yuang Shi,Simone Gasparini,Géraldine Morin,Wei Tsang Ooi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种结合Sketch和Patch高斯分布的混合表示方法，通过结构感知的分层分类框架实现高效3D场景存储与流传输。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受传统艺术技法启发，观察到高斯在特征层次上的区别，需解决模型压缩时高频细节丢失和依赖外部3D线特征的问题。

Method: 基于多标准密度聚类与自适应质量优化算法，将高斯分为边界感知型(Sketch)和平滑区域型(Patch)，建立层次化结构实现渐进式渲染。

Result: 较均匀剪枝基线方法，在相同比特率下PSNR提升1.74dB，SSIM提升6.7%，LPIPS降低41.4%，室内场景仅需0.5%模型体积即可维持视觉质量。

Conclusion: 该结构感知的混合表示突破传统点云压缩范式，显著优化3D资产在移动端和AR/VR场景中的传输效率与视觉保真度。

Abstract: We observe that Gaussians exhibit distinct roles and characteristics analogous to traditional artistic techniques -- like how artists first sketch outlines before filling in broader areas with color, some Gaussians capture high-frequency features such as edges and contours, while others represent broader, smoother regions analogous to brush strokes that add volume and depth. Based on this observation, we propose a hybrid representation that categorizes Gaussians into (i) Sketch Gaussians, which represent high-frequency, boundary-defining features, and (ii) Patch Gaussians, which cover low-frequency, smooth regions. This semantic separation naturally enables layered progressive streaming, where the compact Sketch Gaussians establish the structural skeleton before Patch Gaussians incrementally refine volumetric detail.
  In this work, we extend our previous method to arbitrary 3D scenes by proposing a novel hierarchical adaptive categorization framework that operates directly on the 3DGS representation. Our approach employs multi-criteria density-based clustering, combined with adaptive quality-driven refinement. This method eliminates dependency on external 3D line primitives while ensuring optimal parametric encoding effectiveness. Our comprehensive evaluation across diverse scenes, including both man-made and natural environments, demonstrates that our method achieves up to 1.74 dB improvement in PSNR, 6.7% in SSIM, and 41.4% in LPIPS at equivalent model sizes compared to uniform pruning baselines. For indoor scenes, our method can maintain visual quality with only 0.5\% of the original model size. This structure-aware representation enables efficient storage, adaptive streaming, and rendering of high-fidelity 3D content across bandwidth-constrained networks and resource-limited devices.

### [6] [Multi-task Cross-modal Learning for Chest X-ray Image Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05399)
*Zhaohui Liang,Sivaramakrishnan Rajaraman,Niccolo Marini,Zhiyun Xue,Sameer Antani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种多任务学习框架对BiomedCLIP进行微调，通过引入包含二元分类、对比学习与CLIP损失的复合目标，在胸部X光图像与文本的互检任务中实现了更均衡的临床有效检索性能，并通过t-SNE可视化验证了模型对正常/异常病例的语义区分能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP和BiomedCLIP作为跨模态基础模型，在通用视觉-语言嵌入方面表现出色，但未针对医学领域的细粒度检索任务（如基于胸部X光图像查询放射学报告）进行优化。这限制了其在医疗场景中的临床适用性，因此需要针对性的领域适配方法。

Method: 以BiomedCLIP为骨干模型，增加轻量级MLP投影头，并设计多任务复合损失函数：1) 二元交叉熵损失区分正常/异常X光影像；2) 监督对比损失增强同类样本一致性；3) 保留原始CLIP的跨模态对齐损失。通过端到端训练实现领域知识迁移。

Result: 微调模型在图像→文本和文本→图像双任务检索中均显著优于预训练BiomedCLIP与通用CLIP模型，达到临床级指标平衡性。t-SNE分析显示正常/异常病例的特征向量在嵌入空间呈现紧凑且可区分的聚类结构，验证模型对病理特征的敏感性提升。

Conclusion: 本研究证明通过领域自适应微调与多任务学习策略，可有效增强视觉-语言基础模型在医学跨模态检索场景中的表现力，为生物医学工程中的特定下游任务提供了改进框架的技术范式。

Abstract: CLIP and BiomedCLIP are examples of vision-language foundation models and offer strong cross-modal embeddings; however, they are not optimized for fine-grained medical retrieval tasks, such as retrieving clinically relevant radiology reports using chest X-ray (CXR) image queries. To address this shortcoming, we propose a multi-task learning framework to fine-tune BiomedCLIP and evaluate improvements to CXR image-text retrieval. Using BiomedCLIP as the backbone, we incorporate a lightweight MLP projector head trained with a multi-task composite loss function that includes: (1) a binary cross-entropy loss to distinguish normal from abnormal CXR studies, (2) a supervised contrastive loss to reinforce intra-class consistency, and (3) a CLIP loss to maintain cross-modal alignment. Experimental results demonstrate that the fine-tuned model achieves more balanced and clinically meaningful performance across both image-to-text and text-to-image retrieval tasks compared to the pretrained BiomedCLIP and general-purpose CLIP models. Furthermore, t-SNE visualizations reveal clearer semantic clustering of normal and abnormal cases, demonstrating the model's enhanced diagnostic sensitivity. These findings highlight the value of domain-adaptive, multi-task learning for advancing cross-modal retrieval in biomedical applications.

### [7] [TAPM-Net: Trajectory-Aware Perturbation Modeling for Infrared Small Target Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05446)
*Hongyang Xie,Hongyang He,Victor Sanchez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TAPM-Net通过建模特征扰动轨迹提升红外小目标检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于CNN和ViT的红外小目标检测方法缺乏追踪小目标引起特征空间方向性扰动的机制，导致难以区分信号与结构化噪声。

Method: 提出包含PGM和TASB的双模块架构：PGM通过多级特征构建扰动能量场并提取梯度路径，TASB利用Mamba建模轨迹传播并结合速度约束扩散与语义对齐特征融合。

Result: 在NUAA-SIRST和IRSTD-1K数据集上均达到最先进检测性能。

Conclusion: 相比注意力机制,TAPM-Net实现各向异性、上下文敏感的传播路径，在保持全局一致性的同时降低计算成本。

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (ISTD) remains a long-standing challenge due to weak signal contrast, limited spatial extent, and cluttered backgrounds. Despite performance improvements from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs), current models lack a mechanism to trace how small targets trigger directional, layer-wise perturbations in the feature space, which is an essential cue for distinguishing signal from structured noise in infrared scenes. To address this limitation, we propose the Trajectory-Aware Mamba Propagation Network (TAPM-Net), which explicitly models the spatial diffusion behavior of target-induced feature disturbances. TAPM-Net is built upon two novel components: a Perturbation-guided Path Module (PGM) and a Trajectory-Aware State Block (TASB). The PGM constructs perturbation energy fields from multi-level features and extracts gradient-following feature trajectories that reflect the directionality of local responses. The resulting feature trajectories are fed into the TASB, a Mamba-based state-space unit that models dynamic propagation along each trajectory while incorporating velocity-constrained diffusion and semantically aligned feature fusion from word-level and sentence-level embeddings. Unlike existing attention-based methods, TAPM-Net enables anisotropic, context-sensitive state transitions along spatial trajectories while maintaining global coherence at low computational cost. Experiments on NUAA-SIRST and IRSTD-1K demonstrate that TAPM-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance in ISTD.

### [8] [ROAP: A Reading-Order and Attention-Prior Pipeline for Optimizing Layout Transformers in Key Information Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05470)
*Tingwei Xie,Jinxin He,Yonghong Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了ROAP，一种轻量级且架构无关的流水线方法，用于优化布局Transformer中的注意力分布，无需修改预训练模型结构，通过建模逻辑阅读顺序和抑制视觉干扰提升文档理解效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有多模态Transformer在文档理解中因缺乏对逻辑阅读顺序的显式建模及视觉标记干扰导致的文本语义注意力稀释问题。

Method: 1. 使用Adaptive-XY-Gap树（AXG-Tree）从复杂布局中提取层级阅读序列；2. 通过阅读顺序感知的相对位置偏差（RO-RPB）整合序列到注意力机制；3. 提出文本标记子块注意力先验（TT-Prior）动态抑制视觉噪声并强化文本间细粒度交互。

Result: 在FUNSD和CORD数据集上实验表明，ROAP显著提升LayoutLMv3和GeoLayoutLM等基准模型性能，验证了方案有效性。

Conclusion: 显式建模阅读逻辑与模态干扰调节对文档理解至关重要，ROAP为复杂版式分析提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: The efficacy of Multimodal Transformers in visually-rich document understanding (VrDU) is critically constrained by two inherent limitations: the lack of explicit modeling for logical reading order and the interference of visual tokens that dilutes attention on textual semantics.
  To address these challenges, this paper presents ROAP, a lightweight and architecture-agnostic pipeline designed to optimize attention distributions in Layout Transformers without altering their pre-trained backbones.
  The proposed pipeline first employs an Adaptive-XY-Gap (AXG-Tree) to robustly extract hierarchical reading sequences from complex layouts. These sequences are then integrated into the attention mechanism via a Reading-Order-Aware Relative Position Bias (RO-RPB). Furthermore, a Textual-Token Sub-block Attention Prior (TT-Prior) is introduced to adaptively suppress visual noise and enhance fine-grained text-text interactions.
  Extensive experiments on the FUNSD and CORD benchmarks demonstrate that ROAP consistently improves the performance of representative backbones, including LayoutLMv3 and GeoLayoutLM.
  These findings confirm that explicitly modeling reading logic and regulating modality interference are critical for robust document understanding, offering a scalable solution for complex layout analysis. The implementation code will be released at https://github.com/KevinYuLei/ROAP.

### [9] [Multi-Image Super Resolution Framework for Detection and Analysis of Plant Roots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05482)

Result: 在BRISQUE指标上降低2.3%，保持CLIP-IQA评分的同时提升图像质量，有效实现根毛数量与密度的精确量化分析。

Conclusion: 该框架为地下根系自动成像与表型分析提供了可靠技术路径，对农业和生态保护研究具有应用价值。

Abstract: Understanding plant root systems is critical for advancing research in soil-plant interactions, nutrient uptake, and overall plant health. However, accurate imaging of roots in subterranean environments remains a persistent challenge due to adverse conditions such as occlusion, varying soil moisture, and inherently low contrast, which limit the effectiveness of conventional vision-based approaches. In this work, we propose a novel underground imaging system that captures multiple overlapping views of plant roots and integrates a deep learning-based Multi-Image Super Resolution (MISR) framework designed to enhance root visibility and detail. To train and evaluate our approach, we construct a synthetic dataset that simulates realistic underground imaging scenarios, incorporating key environmental factors that affect image quality. Our proposed MISR algorithm leverages spatial redundancy across views to reconstruct high-resolution images with improved structural fidelity and visual clarity. Quantitative evaluations show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art super resolution baselines, achieving a 2.3 percent reduction in BRISQUE, indicating improved image quality with the same CLIP-IQA score, thereby enabling enhanced phenotypic analysis of root systems. This, in turn, facilitates accurate estimation of critical root traits, including root hair count and root hair density. The proposed framework presents a promising direction for robust automatic underground plant root imaging and trait quantification for agricultural and ecological research.

### [10] [Hippocampal Atrophy Patterns Across the Alzheimer's Disease Spectrum: A Voxel-Based Morphometry Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05494)
*Trishna Niraula*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study used MRI scans from 249 participants to show significant hippocampal atrophy in Alzheimer's disease (AD) compared to cognitively normal (CN) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) groups, with hippocampal volume moderately predicting MCI progression to AD. APOE4 genetic status did not affect hippocampal volume.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate gray matter loss patterns in AD and MCI, evaluate hippocampal volume as a biomarker for early detection, and assess genetic influences (APOE4) on brain structure.

Method: Voxel-based morphometry (CAT12/SPM12) applied to baseline T1-weighted MRIs of 249 ADNI participants (CN=90, MCI=129, AD=30). Gray matter volume analyzed via general linear models with diagnostic group as predictor, adjusted for age and intracranial volume. Statistical thresholds: p<0.001 (voxelwise) + FWE cluster correction (p<0.05).

Result: AD showed greater hippocampal atrophy vs. CN (Cohen's d=2.03) and MCI (d=1.61). Hippocampal volume predicted MCI-to-AD conversion (AUC=0.66). No significant APOE4 effects on cross-sectional hippocampal volume observed.

Conclusion: Medial temporal degeneration is a key AD progression feature. Hippocampal volume serves as a moderate predictive biomarker for MCI conversion, but APOE4 status does not significantly impact detectable hippocampal volume differences in this cross-sectional analysis.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are associated with progressive gray matter loss, particularly in medial temporal structures. In this study, CAT12/SPM12 voxel-based morphometry was applied to baseline T1-weighted MRI scans from 249 ADNI participants (CN = 90, MCI = 129, AD = 30). Gray matter volume was analyzed using a general linear model, with the diagnostic group as primary predictor and age and total intracranial volume as covariates. Statistical maps were thresholded at p < 0.001 (voxelwise) and corrected for multiple comparisons at the cluster level using family-wise error (FWE) correction (p < 0.05). Significant hippocampal atrophy was observed in AD relative to CN and MCI (Cohen's d = 2.03 and 1.61, respectively). Hippocampal volume demonstrated moderate predictive value for conversion from MCI to AD (AUC = 0.66). Stratification by APOE4 status did not reveal significant genetic effects on cross-sectional hippocampal volume. These results support medial temporal degeneration as a key feature of AD progression and provide insights into predictive biomarkers and genetic influences.

### [11] [MMViR: A Multi-Modal and Multi-Granularity Representation for Long-range Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05495)
*Zizhong Li,Haopeng Zhang,Jiawei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes MMViR, a multi-modal, multi-grained structured representation for long video understanding by identifying key turning points and constructing hierarchical descriptions, improving efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long videos pose challenges due to computational costs and loss of details in conventional methods (direct encoding or simplistic text conversion), requiring an efficient, comprehensive solution.

Method: MMViR segments videos via key turning points and builds a three-level structure merging global narratives with visual details, enabling query-based retrieval and cross-scenario generalization.

Result: MMViR achieved 19.67% improved accuracy in hour-long video understanding and reduced processing latency to 45.4% compared to prior methods across QA, summarization, and retrieval tasks.

Conclusion: Structured multi-granular representations like MMViR outperform traditional approaches in balancing efficiency and detail retention for long video analysis.

Abstract: Long videos, ranging from minutes to hours, present significant challenges for current Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) due to their complex events, diverse scenes, and long-range dependencies. Direct encoding of such videos is computationally too expensive, while simple video-to-text conversion often results in redundant or fragmented content. To address these limitations, we introduce MMViR, a novel multi-modal, multi-grained structured representation for long video understanding. MMViR identifies key turning points to segment the video and constructs a three-level description that couples global narratives with fine-grained visual details. This design supports efficient query-based retrieval and generalizes well across various scenarios. Extensive evaluations across three tasks, including QA, summarization, and retrieval, show that MMViR outperforms the prior strongest method, achieving a 19.67% improvement in hour-long video understanding while reducing processing latency to 45.4% of the original.

*Samuel E. Johnny,Bernes L. Atabonfack,Israel Alagbe,Assane Gueye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于Segment Anything Model（SAM）的多任务深度学习框架，通过像素级分割与诊断分类联合优化，在乳腺超声图像中实现了肿瘤分割与分类的高精度（Dice系数0.887，分类准确率92.3%）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对乳腺超声图像中肿瘤对比度低、斑点噪声干扰和病灶形态多样化导致的分割与分类难题，传统方法依赖手动提示或存在性能瓶颈，需要全监督的端到端解决方案。

Conclusion: 该框架通过解耦SAM特征的层次化利用策略，在医学影像领域证明了基础模型适配与任务驱动学习协同优化的技术潜力。

Abstract: Accurate tumor segmentation and classification in breast ultrasound (BUS) imaging remain challenging due to low contrast, speckle noise, and diverse lesion morphology. This study presents a multi-task deep learning framework that jointly performs lesion segmentation and diagnostic classification using embeddings from the Segment Anything Model (SAM) vision encoder. Unlike prompt-based SAM variants, our approach employs a prompt-free, fully supervised adaptation where high-dimensional SAM features are decoded through either a lightweight convolutional head or a UNet-inspired decoder for pixel-wise segmentation. The classification branch is enhanced via mask-guided attention, allowing the model to focus on lesion-relevant features while suppressing background artifacts. Experiments on the PRECISE 2025 breast ultrasound dataset, split per class into 80 percent training and 20 percent testing, show that the proposed method achieves a Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 0.887 and an accuracy of 92.3 percent, ranking among the top entries on the PRECISE challenge leaderboard. These results demonstrate that SAM-based representations, when coupled with segmentation-guided learning, significantly improve both lesion delineation and diagnostic prediction in breast ultrasound imaging.

### [13] [Enabling Stroke-Level Structural Analysis of Hieroglyphic Scripts without Language-Specific Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05508)
*Fuwen Luo,Zihao Wan,Ziyue Wang,Yaluo Liu,Pau Tong Lin Xu,Xuanjia Qiao,Xiaolong Wang,Peng Li,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes HieroSA, a framework enabling Multimodal LLMs to extract stroke-level structures from hieroglyphs and logographic characters using character bitmaps without manual data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs and MLLMs fail to model the internal stroke logic of hieroglyphs/logographic characters, while existing structural analysis methods are script-specific and labor-intensive.

Method: HieroSA converts character images into interpretable line-segment representations via normalized coordinate space transformation, enabling cross-lingual generalization without language-specific priors.

Result: Experiments show HieroSA effectively captures character-internal structures and semantics across modern/ancient scripts (e.g., Chinese characters and Egyptian hieroglyphs) without handcrafted data.

Conclusion: HieroSA provides a generalizable graphematics analysis tool for understanding hieroglyphic scripts, reducing dependency on language-specific heuristics.

Abstract: Hieroglyphs, as logographic writing systems, encode rich semantic and cultural information within their internal structural composition. Yet, current advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) usually remain structurally blind to this information. LLMs process characters as textual tokens, while MLLMs additionally view them as raw pixel grids. Both fall short to model the underlying logic of character strokes. Furthermore, existing structural analysis methods are often script-specific and labor-intensive. In this paper, we propose Hieroglyphic Stroke Analyzer (HieroSA), a novel and generalizable framework that enables MLLMs to automatically derive stroke-level structures from character bitmaps without handcrafted data. It transforms modern logographic and ancient hieroglyphs character images into explicit, interpretable line-segment representations in a normalized coordinate space, allowing for cross-lingual generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HieroSA effectively captures character-internal structures and semantics, bypassing the need for language-specific priors.

Result: 方法显著提高了身份保留效果与视觉质量，同时保持时间一致性，支持新的交互应用场景。

Conclusion: GaussianSwap实现了从像素化向结构化动态换脸的范式转移，为高清与可交互的换脸技术提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce GaussianSwap, a novel video face swapping framework that constructs a 3D Gaussian Splatting based face avatar from a target video while transferring identity from a source image to the avatar. Conventional video swapping frameworks are limited to generating facial representations in pixel-based formats. The resulting swapped faces exist merely as a set of unstructured pixels without any capacity for animation or interactive manipulation. Our work introduces a paradigm shift from conventional pixel-based video generation to the creation of high-fidelity avatar with swapped faces. The framework first preprocesses target video to extract FLAME parameters, camera poses and segmentation masks, and then rigs 3D Gaussian splats to the FLAME model across frames, enabling dynamic facial control. To ensure identity preserving, we propose an compound identity embedding constructed from three state-of-the-art face recognition models for avatar finetuning. Finally, we render the face-swapped avatar on the background frames to obtain the face-swapped video. Experimental results demonstrate that GaussianSwap achieves superior identity preservation, visual clarity and temporal consistency, while enabling previously unattainable interactive applications.

Conclusion: 通过线性复杂度捕获全局依赖，实现了红外-可见光图像多模态特征互补性保留，解决了传统方法的模态偏倚问题

Abstract: Multi-modal image fusion aims to integrate complementary information from multiple source images to produce high-quality fused images with enriched content. Although existing approaches based on state space model have achieved satisfied performance with high computational efficiency, they tend to either over-prioritize infrared intensity at the cost of visible details, or conversely, preserve visible structure while diminishing thermal target salience. To overcome these challenges, we propose DIFF-MF, a novel difference-driven channel-spatial state space model for multi-modal image fusion. Our approach leverages feature discrepancy maps between modalities to guide feature extraction, followed by a fusion process across both channel and spatial dimensions. In the channel dimension, a channel-exchange module enhances channel-wise interaction through cross-attention dual state space modeling, enabling adaptive feature reweighting. In the spatial dimension, a spatial-exchange module employs cross-modal state space scanning to achieve comprehensive spatial fusion. By efficiently capturing global dependencies while maintaining linear computational complexity, DIFF-MF effectively integrates complementary multi-modal features. Experimental results on the driving scenarios and low-altitude UAV datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in both visual quality and quantitative evaluation.

Abstract: Existing multi-object image generation methods face difficulties in achieving precise alignment between localized image generation regions and their corresponding semantics based on language descriptions, frequently resulting in inconsistent object quantities and attribute aliasing. To mitigate this limitation, mainstream approaches typically rely on external control signals to explicitly constrain the spatial layout, local semantic and visual attributes of images. However, this strong dependency makes the input format rigid, rendering it incompatible with the heterogeneous resource conditions of users and diverse constraint requirements. To address these challenges, we propose MoGen, a user-friendly multi-object image generation method. First, we design a Regional Semantic Anchor (RSA) module that precisely anchors phrase units in language descriptions to their corresponding image regions during the generation process, enabling text-to-image generation that follows quantity specifications for multiple objects. Building upon this foundation, we further introduce an Adaptive Multi-modal Guidance (AMG) module, which adaptively parses and integrates various combinations of multi-source control signals to formulate corresponding structured intent. This intent subsequently guides selective constraints on scene layouts and object attributes, achieving dynamic fine-grained control. Experimental results demonstrate that MoGen significantly outperforms existing methods in generation quality, quantity consistency, and fine-grained control, while exhibiting superior accessibility and control flexibility.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in multimodal tasks, but remain susceptible to hallucinations, where generated text deviates from the underlying visual content. Existing hallucination detection methods primarily rely on output logits or external verification tools, often overlooking their internal mechanisms. In this work, we investigate the outputs of internal attention heads, postulating that specific heads carry the primary signals for truthful generation.However, directly probing these high-dimensional states is challenging due to the entanglement of visual-linguistic syntax and noise. To address this, we propose VIB-Probe, a novel hallucination detection and mitigation framework leveraging the Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) theory. Our method extracts discriminative patterns across layers and heads while filtering out semantic nuisances through the information bottleneck principle. Furthermore, by leveraging the gradients of our VIB probe, we identify attention heads with strong causal influence on hallucinations and introduce an inference-time intervention strategy for hallucination mitigation. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that VIB-Probe significantly outperforms existing baselines in both settings. Our code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Universal visual anomaly detection (AD) aims to identify anomaly images and segment anomaly regions towards open and dynamic scenarios, following zero- and few-shot paradigms without any dataset-specific fine-tuning. We have witnessed significant progress in widely use of visual-language foundational models in recent approaches. However, current methods often struggle with complex prompt engineering, elaborate adaptation modules, and challenging training strategies, ultimately limiting their flexibility and generality. To address these issues, this paper rethinks the fundamental mechanism behind visual-language models for AD and presents an embarrassingly simple, general, and effective framework for Universal vision Anomaly Detection (UniADet). Specifically, we first find language encoder is used to derive decision weights for anomaly classification and segmentation, and then demonstrate that it is unnecessary for universal AD. Second, we propose an embarrassingly simple method to completely decouple classification and segmentation, and decouple cross-level features, i.e., learning independent weights for different tasks and hierarchical features. UniADet is highly simple (learning only decoupled weights), parameter-efficient (only 0.002M learnable parameters), general (adapting a variety of foundation models), and effective (surpassing state-of-the-art zero-/few-shot by a large margin and even full-shot AD methods for the first time) on 14 real-world AD benchmarks covering both industrial and medical domains. We will make the code and model of UniADet available at https://github.com/gaobb/UniADet.

Abstract: Facial expression recognition is a key task in human-computer interaction and affective computing. However, acquiring a large amount of labeled facial expression data is often costly. Therefore, it is particularly important to design a semi-supervised facial expression recognition algorithm that makes full use of both labeled and unlabeled data. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised facial expression recognition algorithm based on Dynamic Threshold Adjustment (DTA) and Selective Negative Learning (SNL). Initially, we designed strategies for local attention enhancement and random dropout of feature maps during feature extraction, which strengthen the representation of local features while ensuring the model does not overfit to any specific local area. Furthermore, this study introduces a dynamic thresholding method to adapt to the requirements of the semi-supervised learning framework for facial expression recognition tasks, and through a selective negative learning strategy, it fully utilizes unlabeled samples with low confidence by mining useful expression information from complementary labels, achieving impressive results. We have achieved state-of-the-art performance on the RAF-DB and AffectNet datasets. Our method surpasses fully supervised methods even without using the entire dataset, which proves the effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种解决社交媒体新闻快照（图文组合）引发解读偏差的问题。现有模型难以准确识别因信息缺失导致的隐性误导（与显性虚假信息不同），作者构建了MM-Misleading基准和OMGuard框架，通过多模态微调和基于因果推理的内容修正，成功提升小型模型的检测与纠正能力，并揭示误导多源自局部叙事缺失而非全局框架转变，强调视觉干预的必要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管信息正确的社交媒体新闻快照可能因选择性省略关键背景，引发与全文内容相悖的解读（解释漂移），但此隐性危害较显性虚假信息更难识别且研究不足。现有大型视觉-语言模型（LVLM）对此类省略型误导存在检测盲点，亟需系统性评估方法与纠正框架。

Method: 1. 构建MM-Misleading基准：基于多阶段流水线分离快照与背景的理解差异；2. 对开源LVLM进行系统评估，发现其对省略误导的检测弱点；3. 提出OMGuard框架：
   (1) 意图感知微调（增强多模态误导检测）；
   (2) 因果推理引导的修正（利用显式因果链重写标题以减少误解）；
4. 通过对比图像驱动与纯文本场景，分析误导根源（局部叙事缺失vs全局框架变化）。

Result: 1. OMGuard使8B模型的检测准确率达到235B模型水平，并显著提升端到端纠错能力；2. 分析表明80%误导源于局部叙事缺失（如背景信息缺失），而非全局叙事框架改变；3. 揭示纯文本修正对图像驱动场景无效，证明视觉干预的必要性。

Conclusion: 本文首次实现对省略型隐蔽误导的自动化检测与修正，提出MM-Misleading基准与OMGuard框架。研究表明：（1）意图感知微调可弥补小型模型的能力差距；（2）图像与文本需协同分析；（3）局部叙事修复比全局框架分析更具实操价值。该成果为治理隐蔽信息操控提供可扩展的技术路径。

Abstract: Even when factually correct, social-media news previews (image-headline pairs) can induce interpretation drift: by selectively omitting crucial context, they lead readers to form judgments that diverge from what the full article conveys. This covert harm is harder to detect than explicit misinformation yet remains underexplored. To address this gap, we develop a multi-stage pipeline that disentangles and simulates preview-based versus context-based understanding, enabling construction of the MM-Misleading benchmark. Using this benchmark, we systematically evaluate open-source LVLMs and uncover pronounced blind spots to omission-based misleadingness detection. We further propose OMGuard, which integrates (1) Interpretation-Aware Fine-Tuning, which used to improve multimodal misleadingness detection and (2) Rationale-Guided Misleading Content Correction, which uses explicit rationales to guide headline rewriting and reduce misleading impressions. Experiments show that OMGuard lifts an 8B model's detection accuracy to match a 235B LVLM and delivers markedly stronger end-to-end correction. Further analysis reveals that misleadingness typically stems from local narrative shifts (e.g., missing background) rather than global frame changes, and identifies image-driven scenarios where text-only correction fails, highlighting the necessity of visual interventions.

Abstract: Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) integrate multimodal understanding and generation, yet they are limited to maintaining visual consistency and disambiguating visual cues when referencing details across multiple input images. In this work, we propose a scalable multi-image editing framework for UMMs that explicitly distinguishes image identities and generalizes to variable input counts. Algorithmically, we introduce two innovations: 1) The learnable latent separators explicitly differentiate each reference image in the latent space, enabling accurate and disentangled conditioning. 2) The sinusoidal index encoding assigns visual tokens from the same image a continuous sinusoidal index embedding, which provides explicit image identity while allowing generalization and extrapolation on a variable number of inputs. To facilitate training and evaluation, we establish a high-fidelity benchmark using an inverse dataset construction methodology to guarantee artifact-free, achievable outputs. Experiments show clear improvements in semantic consistency, visual fidelity, and cross-image integration over prior baselines on diverse multi-image editing tasks, validating our advantages on consistency and generalization ability.

Abstract: This work presents Orient Anything V2, an enhanced foundation model for unified understanding of object 3D orientation and rotation from single or paired images. Building upon Orient Anything V1, which defines orientation via a single unique front face, V2 extends this capability to handle objects with diverse rotational symmetries and directly estimate relative rotations. These improvements are enabled by four key innovations: 1) Scalable 3D assets synthesized by generative models, ensuring broad category coverage and balanced data distribution; 2) An efficient, model-in-the-loop annotation system that robustly identifies 0 to N valid front faces for each object; 3) A symmetry-aware, periodic distribution fitting objective that captures all plausible front-facing orientations, effectively modeling object rotational symmetry; 4) A multi-frame architecture that directly predicts relative object rotations. Extensive experiments show that Orient Anything V2 achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on orientation estimation, 6DoF pose estimation, and object symmetry recognition across 11 widely used benchmarks. The model demonstrates strong generalization, significantly broadening the applicability of orientation estimation in diverse downstream tasks.

Conclusion: 该框架通过持续适应动态生成模型，解决了检测方法的长期有效性难题，为对抗AI生成内容滥用提供了实用技术路径。

Abstract: The malicious misuse and widespread dissemination of AI-generated images pose a significant threat to the authenticity of online information. Current detection methods often struggle to generalize to unseen generative models, and the rapid evolution of generative techniques continuously exacerbates this challenge. Without adaptability, detection models risk becoming ineffective in real-world applications. To address this critical issue, we propose a novel three-stage domain continual learning framework designed for continuous adaptation to evolving generative models. In the first stage, we employ a strategic parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach to develop a transferable offline detection model with strong generalization capabilities. Building upon this foundation, the second stage integrates unseen data streams into a continual learning process. To efficiently learn from limited samples of novel generated models and mitigate overfitting, we design a data augmentation chain with progressively increasing complexity. Furthermore, we leverage the Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (K-FAC) method to approximate the Hessian and alleviate catastrophic forgetting. Finally, the third stage utilizes a linear interpolation strategy based on Linear Mode Connectivity, effectively capturing commonalities across diverse generative models and further enhancing overall performance. We establish a comprehensive benchmark of 27 generative models, including GANs, deepfakes, and diffusion models, chronologically structured up to August 2024 to simulate real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our initial offline detectors surpass the leading baseline by +5.51% in terms of mean average precision. Our continual learning strategy achieves an average accuracy of 92.20%, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: In the field of 3D dynamic scene reconstruction, how to balance model convergence rate and rendering quality has long been a critical challenge that urgently needs to be addressed, particularly in high-precision modeling of scenes with complex dynamic motions. To tackle this issue, this study proposes the GS-DMSR method. By quantitatively analyzing the dynamic evolution process of Gaussian attributes, this mechanism achieves adaptive gradient focusing, enabling it to dynamically identify significant differences in the motion states of Gaussian models. It then applies differentiated optimization strategies to Gaussian models with varying degrees of significance, thereby significantly improving the model convergence rate. Additionally, this research integrates a multi-scale manifold enhancement module, which leverages the collaborative optimization of an implicit nonlinear decoder and an explicit deformation field to enhance the modeling efficiency for complex deformation scenes. Experimental results demonstrate that this method achieves a frame rate of up to 96 FPS on synthetic datasets, while effectively reducing both storage overhead and training time.Our code and data are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/GS-DMSR-2212.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models often struggle with faithful reasoning in complex visual scenes, where intricate entities and relations require precise visual grounding at each step. This reasoning unfaithfulness frequently manifests as hallucinated entities, mis-grounded relations, skipped steps, and over-specified reasoning. Existing preference-based approaches, typically relying on textual perturbations or answer-conditioned rationales, fail to address this challenge as they allow models to exploit language priors to bypass visual grounding. To address this, we propose SceneAlign, a framework that leverages scene graphs as structured visual information to perform controllable structural interventions. By identifying reasoning-critical nodes and perturbing them through four targeted strategies that mimic typical grounding failures, SceneAlign constructs hard negative rationales that remain linguistically plausible but are grounded in inaccurate visual facts. These contrastive pairs are used in Direct Preference Optimization to steer models toward fine-grained, structure-faithful reasoning. Across seven visual reasoning benchmarks, SceneAlign consistently improves answer accuracy and reasoning faithfulness, highlighting the effectiveness of grounding-aware alignment for multimodal reasoning.

TL;DR: Proposes geometric transformations to enhance gait recognition under varying conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods implicitly learn common features from different gait conditions, but there's a lack of explicit exploration of inherent relations between these conditions. This work aims to identify and utilize these relationships to improve recognition.

Method: Proposed RRS-Gait framework that models gait variations as combinations of geometric transformations (Reflect, Rotate, Scale) by adapting convolution kernels for each transformation, followed by global pooling to achieve invariance.

Result: RRS-Gait achieved superior performance across four gait datasets (Gait3D, GREW, CCPG, SUSTech1K) in both cross-view and cross-clothing scenarios.

Conclusion: Modeling gait variations as combinations of geometric transformations enables better identity-invariant features, offering a novel perspective for gait recognition under diverse conditions.

Abstract: The goal of gait recognition is to extract identity-invariant features of an individual under various gait conditions, e.g., cross-view and cross-clothing. Most gait models strive to implicitly learn the common traits across different gait conditions in a data-driven manner to pull different gait conditions closer for recognition. However, relatively few studies have explicitly explored the inherent relations between different gait conditions. For this purpose, we attempt to establish connections among different gait conditions and propose a new perspective to achieve gait recognition: variations in different gait conditions can be approximately viewed as a combination of geometric transformations. In this case, all we need is to determine the types of geometric transformations and achieve geometric invariance, then identity invariance naturally follows. As an initial attempt, we explore three common geometric transformations (i.e., Reflect, Rotate, and Scale) and design a $\mathcal{R}$eflect-$\mathcal{R}$otate-$\mathcal{S}$cale invariance learning framework, named ${\mathcal{RRS}}$-Gait. Specifically, it first flexibly adjusts the convolution kernel based on the specific geometric transformations to achieve approximate feature equivariance. Then these three equivariant-aware features are respectively fed into a global pooling operation for final invariance-aware learning. Extensive experiments on four popular gait datasets (Gait3D, GREW, CCPG, SUSTech1K) show superior performance across various gait conditions.

Although these models achieve high-quality reconstructions, they are typically complex, heavyweight, and require substantial training data and computational resources. We propose a methodology to partially compress these networks by reducing the size of their encoders. Our approach uses a simplified knowledge distillation strategy to approximate the latent space of the original models with less data and shorter training, yielding lightweight encoders from heavyweight ones. We evaluate the resulting lightweight encoders across two different architectures on the image compression task. Experiments show that our method preserves reconstruction quality and statistical fidelity better than training lightweight encoders with the original loss, making it practical for resource-limited environments.

Abstract: Recent end-to-end autonomous driving approaches have leveraged Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to enhance planning capabilities in complex driving scenarios. However, VLMs are inherently trained as generalist models, lacking specialized understanding of driving-specific reasoning in 3D space and time. When applied to autonomous driving, these models struggle to establish structured spatial-temporal representations that capture geometric relationships, scene context, and motion patterns critical for safe trajectory planning. To address these limitations, we propose SGDrive, a novel framework that explicitly structures the VLM's representation learning around driving-specific knowledge hierarchies. Built upon a pre-trained VLM backbone, SGDrive decomposes driving understanding into a scene-agent-goal hierarchy that mirrors human driving cognition: drivers first perceive the overall environment (scene context), then attend to safety-critical agents and their behaviors, and finally formulate short-term goals before executing actions. This hierarchical decomposition provides the structured spatial-temporal representation that generalist VLMs lack, integrating multi-level information into a compact yet comprehensive format for trajectory planning. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM benchmark demonstrate that SGDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance among camera-only methods on both PDMS and EPDMS, validating the effectiveness of hierarchical knowledge structuring for adapting generalist VLMs to autonomous driving.

Conclusion: SketchVL证明细粒度信用分配机制能显著增强多模态模型推理能力，为类人分步决策系统提供新方向。

Abstract: Charts are high-density visual carriers of complex data and medium for information extraction and analysis. Due to the need for precise and complex visual reasoning, automated chart understanding poses a significant challenge to existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Many MLLMs trained with reinforcement learning (RL) face the challenge of credit assignment. Their advantage estimation, typically performed at the trajectory level, cannot distinguish between correct and incorrect reasoning steps within a single generated response. To address this limitation, we introduce SketchVL, a novel MLLM that optimized with FinePO, a new RL algorithm designed for fine-grained credit assignment within each trajectory. SketchVL's methodology involves drawing its intermediate reasoning steps as markers on the image and feeding the annotated image back to itself, creating a robust, multi-step reasoning process. During training, the FinePO algorithm leverages a Fine-grained Process Reward Model (FinePRM) to score each drawing action within a trajectory, thereby precisely assigning credit for each step. This mechanism allows FinePO to more strongly reward correct tokens when a trajectory is globally successful, and more heavily penalize incorrect tokens when the trajectory is globally suboptimal, thus achieving fine-grained reinforcement signals. Experiments show that SketchVL learns to align its step-level behavior with the FinePRM, achieving an average performance gain of 7.23\% over its base model across chart datasets, natural image datasets, and mathematics, providing a promising new direction for training powerful reasoning models.

Result: 在舞蹈视频生成任务中显著优于DanceGRPO基线方法，且降低计算开销。

Conclusion: 简单有效的TAGRPO框架证明了对比学习与记忆机制对图像到视频生成的重要性。

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated the efficacy of integrating Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) into flow matching models, particularly for text-to-image and text-to-video generation. However, we find that directly applying these techniques to image-to-video (I2V) models often fails to yield consistent reward improvements. To address this limitation, we present TAGRPO, a robust post-training framework for I2V models inspired by contrastive learning. Our approach is grounded in the observation that rollout videos generated from identical initial noise provide superior guidance for optimization. Leveraging this insight, we propose a novel GRPO loss applied to intermediate latents, encouraging direct alignment with high-reward trajectories while maximizing distance from low-reward counterparts. Furthermore, we introduce a memory bank for rollout videos to enhance diversity and reduce computational overhead. Despite its simplicity, TAGRPO achieves significant improvements over DanceGRPO in I2V generation.

Abstract: We present a real-time tracking SLAM system that unifies efficient camera tracking with photorealistic feature-enriched mapping using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Our main contribution is integrating dense feature rasterization into the novel-view synthesis, aligned with a visual foundation model. This yields strong semantics, going beyond basic RGB-D input, aiding both tracking and mapping accuracy. Unlike previous semantic SLAM approaches (which embed pre-defined class labels) FeatureSLAM enables entirely new downstream tasks via free-viewpoint, open-set segmentation. Across standard benchmarks, our method achieves real-time tracking, on par with state-of-the-art systems while improving tracking stability and map fidelity without prohibitive compute. Quantitatively, we obtain 9\% lower pose error and 8\% higher mapping accuracy compared to recent fixed-set SLAM baselines. Our results confirm that real-time feature-embedded SLAM, is not only valuable for enabling new downstream applications. It also improves the performance of the underlying tracking and mapping subsystems, providing semantic and language masking results that are on-par with offline 3DGS models, alongside state-of-the-art tracking, depth and RGB rendering.

Conclusion: ViTNT-FIQA 提供了即插即用的 ViT 基础模型质量评估方案，兼具精度与效率优势，为后续研究提供了轻量化新思路。

Abstract: Face Image Quality Assessment (FIQA) is essential for reliable face recognition systems. Current approaches primarily exploit only final-layer representations, while training-free methods require multiple forward passes or backpropagation. We propose ViTNT-FIQA, a training-free approach that measures the stability of patch embedding evolution across intermediate Vision Transformer (ViT) blocks. We demonstrate that high-quality face images exhibit stable feature refinement trajectories across blocks, while degraded images show erratic transformations. Our method computes Euclidean distances between L2-normalized patch embeddings from consecutive transformer blocks and aggregates them into image-level quality scores. We empirically validate this correlation on a quality-labeled synthetic dataset with controlled degradation levels. Unlike existing training-free approaches, ViTNT-FIQA requires only a single forward pass without backpropagation or architectural modifications. Through extensive evaluation on eight benchmarks (LFW, AgeDB-30, CFP-FP, CALFW, Adience, CPLFW, XQLFW, IJB-C), we show that ViTNT-FIQA achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods while maintaining computational efficiency and immediate applicability to any pre-trained ViT-based face recognition model.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly deployed in close proximity to humans for applications such as parcel delivery, traffic monitoring, disaster response and infrastructure inspections. Ensuring safe and reliable operation in these human-populated environments demands accurate perception of human poses and actions from an aerial viewpoint. This perspective challenges existing methods with low resolution, steep viewing angles and (self-)occlusion, especially if the application demands realtime feasibile models. We train and deploy FlyPose, a lightweight top-down human pose estimation pipeline for aerial imagery. Through multi-dataset training, we achieve an average improvement of 6.8 mAP in person detection across the test-sets of Manipal-UAV, VisDrone, HIT-UAV as well as our custom dataset. For 2D human pose estimation we report an improvement of 16.3 mAP on the challenging UAV-Human dataset. FlyPose runs with an inference latency of ~20 milliseconds including preprocessing on a Jetson Orin AGX Developer Kit and is deployed onboard a quadrotor UAV during flight experiments. We also publish FlyPose-104, a small but challenging aerial human pose estimation dataset, that includes manual annotations from difficult aerial perspectives: https://github.com/farooqhassaan/FlyPose.

Abstract: Multi-view multi-label learning frequently suffers from simultaneous feature absence and incomplete annotations, due to challenges in data acquisition and cost-intensive supervision. To tackle the complex yet highly practical problem while overcoming the existing limitations of feature recovery, representation disentanglement, and label semantics modeling, we propose an Adaptive Disentangled Representation Learning method (ADRL). ADRL achieves robust view completion by propagating feature-level affinity across modalities with neighborhood awareness, and reinforces reconstruction effectiveness by leveraging a stochastic masking strategy. Through disseminating category-level association across label distributions, ADRL refines distribution parameters for capturing interdependent label prototypes. Besides, we formulate a mutual-information-based objective to promote consistency among shared representations and suppress information overlap between view-specific representation and other modalities. Theoretically, we derive the tractable bounds to train the dual-channel network. Moreover, ADRL performs prototype-specific feature selection by enabling independent interactions between label embeddings and view representations, accompanied by the generation of pseudo-labels for each category. The structural characteristics of the pseudo-label space are then exploited to guide a discriminative trade-off during view fusion. Finally, extensive experiments on public datasets and real-world applications demonstrate the superior performance of ADRL.

Abstract: The ability to automatically generate large-scale, interactive, and physically realistic 3D environments is crucial for advancing robotic learning and embodied intelligence. However, existing generative approaches often fail to capture the functional complexity of real-world interiors, particularly those containing articulated objects with movable parts essential for manipulation and navigation. This paper presents SceneFoundry, a language-guided diffusion framework that generates apartment-scale 3D worlds with functionally articulated furniture and semantically diverse layouts for robotic training. From natural language prompts, an LLM module controls floor layout generation, while diffusion-based posterior sampling efficiently populates the scene with articulated assets from large-scale 3D repositories. To ensure physical usability, SceneFoundry employs differentiable guidance functions to regulate object quantity, prevent articulation collisions, and maintain sufficient walkable space for robotic navigation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework generates structurally valid, semantically coherent, and functionally interactive environments across diverse scene types and conditions, enabling scalable embodied AI research.

Abstract: Accurate surround-view depth estimation provides a competitive alternative to laser-based sensors and is essential for 3D scene understanding in autonomous driving. While prior studies have proposed various approaches that primarily focus on enforcing cross-view constraints at the photometric level, few explicitly exploit the rich geometric structure inherent in both monocular and surround-view setting. In this work, we propose GeoSurDepth, a framework that leverages geometry consistency as the primary cue for surround-view depth estimation. Concretely, we utilize foundation models as a pseudo geometry prior and feature representation enhancement tool to guide the network to maintain surface normal consistency in spatial 3D space and regularize object- and texture-consistent depth estimation in 2D. In addition, we introduce a novel view synthesis pipeline where 2D-3D lifting is achieved with dense depth reconstructed via spatial warping, encouraging additional photometric supervision across temporal, spatial, and spatial-temporal contexts, and compensating for the limitations of single-view image reconstruction. Finally, a newly-proposed adaptive joint motion learning strategy enables the network to adaptively emphasize informative spatial geometry cues for improved motion reasoning. Extensive experiments on DDAD and nuScenes demonstrate that GeoSurDepth achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of our approach. Our framework highlights the importance of exploiting geometry coherence and consistency for robust self-supervised multi-view depth estimation.

Abstract: Recent advancements in video generation have enabled the development of ``world models'' capable of simulating potential futures for robotics and planning. However, specifying precise goals for these models remains a challenge; text instructions are often too abstract to capture physical nuances, while target images are frequently infeasible to specify for dynamic tasks. To address this, we introduce Goal Force, a novel framework that allows users to define goals via explicit force vectors and intermediate dynamics, mirroring how humans conceptualize physical tasks. We train a video generation model on a curated dataset of synthetic causal primitives-such as elastic collisions and falling dominos-teaching it to propagate forces through time and space. Despite being trained on simple physics data, our model exhibits remarkable zero-shot generalization to complex, real-world scenarios, including tool manipulation and multi-object causal chains. Our results suggest that by grounding video generation in fundamental physical interactions, models can emerge as implicit neural physics simulators, enabling precise, physics-aware planning without reliance on external engines. We release all datasets, code, model weights, and interactive video demos at our project page.

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for decomposing arbitrarily posed humans into animatable multi-layered 3D human avatars, separating the body and garments. Conventional single-layer reconstruction methods lock clothing to one identity, while prior multi-layer approaches struggle with occluded regions. We overcome both limitations by encoding each layer as a set of 2D Gaussians for accurate geometry and photorealistic rendering, and inpainting hidden regions with a pretrained 2D diffusion model via score-distillation sampling (SDS). Our three-stage training strategy first reconstructs the coarse canonical garment via single-layer reconstruction, followed by multi-layer training to jointly recover the inner-layer body and outer-layer garment details. Experiments on two 3D human benchmark datasets (4D-Dress, Thuman2.0) show that our approach achieves better rendering quality and layer decomposition and recomposition than the previous state-of-the-art, enabling realistic virtual try-on under novel viewpoints and poses, and advancing practical creation of high-fidelity 3D human assets for immersive applications.

Abstract: Semi-supervised medical image segmentation is an effective method for addressing scenarios with limited labeled data. Existing methods mainly rely on frameworks such as mean teacher and dual-stream consistency learning. These approaches often face issues like error accumulation and model structural complexity, while also neglecting the interaction between labeled and unlabeled data streams. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Bidirectional Channel-selective Semantic Interaction~(BCSI) framework for semi-supervised medical image segmentation. First, we propose a Semantic-Spatial Perturbation~(SSP) mechanism, which disturbs the data using two strong augmentation operations and leverages unsupervised learning with pseudo-labels from weak augmentations. Additionally, we employ consistency on the predictions from the two strong augmentations to further improve model stability and robustness. Second, to reduce noise during the interaction between labeled and unlabeled data, we propose a Channel-selective Router~(CR) component, which dynamically selects the most relevant channels for information exchange. This mechanism ensures that only highly relevant features are activated, minimizing unnecessary interference. Finally, the Bidirectional Channel-wise Interaction~(BCI) strategy is employed to supplement additional semantic information and enhance the representation of important channels. Experimental results on multiple benchmarking 3D medical datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing semi-supervised approaches.

Abstract: Recent deepfake detection methods have increasingly explored frequency domain representations to reveal manipulation artifacts that are difficult to detect in the spatial domain. However, most existing approaches rely primarily on spectral magnitude, implicitly under exploring the role of phase information. In this work, we propose Phase4DFD, a phase aware frequency domain deepfake detection framework that explicitly models phase magnitude interactions via a learnable attention mechanism. Our approach augments standard RGB input with Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) magnitude and local binary pattern (LBP) representations to expose subtle synthesis artifacts that remain indistinguishable under spatial analysis alone. Crucially, we introduce an input level phase aware attention module that uses phase discontinuities commonly introduced by synthetic generation to guide the model toward frequency patterns that are most indicative of manipulation before backbone feature extraction. The attended multi domain representation is processed by an efficient BNext M backbone, with optional channel spatial attention applied for semantic feature refinement. Extensive experiments on the CIFAKE and DFFD datasets demonstrate that our proposed model Phase4DFD outperforms state of the art spatial and frequency-based detectors while maintaining low computational overhead. Comprehensive ablation studies further confirm that explicit phase modeling provides complementary and non-redundant information beyond magnitude-only frequency representations.

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一种基于Vision Transformer的深度学习模型，用于胰腺肿瘤的内窥镜超声（EUS）分割，显著提升了诊断准确性，但仍需解决数据集异质性和外部验证不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胰腺癌因高侵袭性且EUS诊断受制于操作者主观性，需通过自动化模型减少误判风险。

Method: 基于USFM框架构建Vision Transformer分割模型，使用17,367张EUS图像进行五折交叉验证，并以独立数据集的350张人工标注图像作外部验证，预处理包括灰度转换、裁剪及标准化为512x512像素，评估指标含DSC、IoU、敏感度等。

Result: 五折验证显示DSC 0.651（±0.738）、IoU 0.579（±0.658）、敏感度69.8%、特异性98.8%；外部验证DSC 0.657（95%CI 0.634-0.769）、IoU 0.614（95%CI 0.590-0.689），但9.7%样本出现多预测错误。

Conclusion: 模型在EUS肿瘤分割中表现稳健，但数据异质性及验证规模有限，需后续优化模型并开展前瞻性研究。

Abstract: Background: Pancreatic cancer is one of the most aggressive cancers, with poor survival rates. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is a key diagnostic modality, but its effectiveness is constrained by operator subjectivity. This study evaluates a Vision Transformer-based deep learning segmentation model for pancreatic tumors. Methods: A segmentation model using the USFM framework with a Vision Transformer backbone was trained and validated with 17,367 EUS images (from two public datasets) in 5-fold cross-validation. The model was tested on an independent dataset of 350 EUS images from another public dataset, manually segmented by radiologists. Preprocessing included grayscale conversion, cropping, and resizing to 512x512 pixels. Metrics included Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), intersection over union (IoU), sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. Results: In 5-fold cross-validation, the model achieved a mean DSC of 0.651 +/- 0.738, IoU of 0.579 +/- 0.658, sensitivity of 69.8%, specificity of 98.8%, and accuracy of 97.5%. For the external validation set, the model achieved a DSC of 0.657 (95% CI: 0.634-0.769), IoU of 0.614 (95% CI: 0.590-0.689), sensitivity of 71.8%, and specificity of 97.7%. Results were consistent, but 9.7% of cases exhibited erroneous multiple predictions. Conclusions: The Vision Transformer-based model demonstrated strong performance for pancreatic tumor segmentation in EUS images. However, dataset heterogeneity and limited external validation highlight the need for further refinement, standardization, and prospective studies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉-语言模型在开放任务中生成与输入图像不一致的回答（幻觉）是当前主要缺陷，影响模型可信度。研究其生成动态并开发有效缓解策略成为关键需求。

Method: 使用Logit Lens探测模型各解码层生成机制，发现真实词汇比幻觉词汇更早形成明确概率分布（承诺深度差距），据此提出CEI方法，通过注入最后一输入词的上下文嵌入维持视觉一致性。

Result: CEI在CHAIR、AMBER和MMHal-Bench三大基准测试中性能超越现有最佳模型，动态版本幻觉率最低，且支持最长512令牌生成。

Conclusion: 该工作通过揭示模型机制并提出可扩展干预方案，显著推进了大视觉-语言模型幻觉问题的解决。

Abstract: Hallucinations, generating responses inconsistent with the visual input, remain a critical limitation of large vision-language models (LVLMs), especially in open-ended tasks such as image captioning and visual reasoning. In this work, we probe the layer-wise generation dynamics that drive hallucinations and propose a training-free mitigation strategy. Employing the Logit Lens, we examine how LVLMs construct next-token distributions across decoder layers, uncovering a pronounced commitment-depth gap: truthful tokens accumulate probability mass on their final candidates earlier than hallucinatory ones. Drawing on this discovery, we introduce Context Embedding Injection (CEI), a lightweight method that harnesses the hidden state of the last input token-the context embedding-as a grounding signal to maintain visual fidelity throughout decoding and curb hallucinations. Evaluated on the CHAIR, AMBER, and MMHal-Bench benchmarks (with a maximum token length of 512), CEI outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across three LVLMs, with its dynamic variant yielding the lowest overall hallucination rates. By integrating novel mechanistic insights with a scalable intervention, this work advances the mitigation of hallucinations in LVLMs.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了基于小波频域学习的视网膜血管分割框架WaveRNet，通过频域分离、跨域融合和渐进式优化，在光照与对比度变化下实现鲁棒的分布式域泛化血管分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于Segment Anything Model(SAM)的方法仅通过微调适配器处理域迁移问题，忽视了频域信息对光照不变特征的编码能力，导致在非均匀照明和对比度变化场景下性能退化，且SAM直接上采样会丢失血管细边界。

Method: 提出三阶段架构：1)通过小波分解与可学习域tokens分离低频照明鲁棒结构(HMPR)；2)基于小波频域相似性进行软加权跨域融合(FADF)；3)采用长距离依赖建模的从粗到精掩码优化模块(HMPR)。

Conclusion: WaveRNet通过频域解耦和动态域融合机制，有效解决了跨设备、跨成像条件的血管分割泛化难题，在医学影像诊断中展现出显著优势。代码已开源。

Abstract: Domain-generalized retinal vessel segmentation is critical for automated ophthalmic diagnosis, yet faces significant challenges from domain shift induced by non-uniform illumination and varying contrast, compounded by the difficulty of preserving fine vessel structures. While the Segment Anything Model (SAM) exhibits remarkable zero-shot capabilities, existing SAM-based methods rely on simple adapter fine-tuning while overlooking frequency-domain information that encodes domain-invariant features, resulting in degraded generalization under illumination and contrast variations. Furthermore, SAM's direct upsampling inevitably loses fine vessel details. To address these limitations, we propose WaveRNet, a wavelet-guided frequency learning framework for robust multi-source domain-generalized retinal vessel segmentation. Specifically, we devise a Spectral-guided Domain Modulator (SDM) that integrates wavelet decomposition with learnable domain tokens, enabling the separation of illumination-robust low-frequency structures from high-frequency vessel boundaries while facilitating domain-specific feature generation. Furthermore, we introduce a Frequency-Adaptive Domain Fusion (FADF) module that performs intelligent test-time domain selection through wavelet-based frequency similarity and soft-weighted fusion. Finally, we present a Hierarchical Mask-Prompt Refiner (HMPR) that overcomes SAM's upsampling limitation through coarse-to-fine refinement with long-range dependency modeling. Extensive experiments under the Leave-One-Domain-Out protocol on four public retinal datasets demonstrate that WaveRNet achieves state-of-the-art generalization performance.

TL;DR: VideoAR is a scalable Visual Autoregressive framework combining multi-scale next-frame prediction and 3D tokenization, achieving state-of-the-art results with improved efficiency over diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion/flow-matching models for video generation are high-quality yet computationally heavy; VideoAR aims to enable efficient, scalable autoregressive video generation.

Method: Integrates intra-frame VAR modeling with causal next-frame prediction via a 3D multi-scale tokenizer, plus Multi-scale Temporal RoPE, Cross-Frame Error Correction, and Random Frame Mask to stabilize temporal consistency.

Result: Reduces FVD on UCF-101 from 99.5 to 88.6, cuts inference steps by 10x, and achieves VBench score 81.74 - competitive with much larger diffusion models.

Conclusion: VideoAR bridges autoregressive and diffusion models' performance gap, offering a scalable, efficient foundation for video generation.

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have been dominated by diffusion and flow-matching models, which produce high-quality results but remain computationally intensive and difficult to scale. In this work, we introduce VideoAR, the first large-scale Visual Autoregressive (VAR) framework for video generation that combines multi-scale next-frame prediction with autoregressive modeling. VideoAR disentangles spatial and temporal dependencies by integrating intra-frame VAR modeling with causal next-frame prediction, supported by a 3D multi-scale tokenizer that efficiently encodes spatio-temporal dynamics. To improve long-term consistency, we propose Multi-scale Temporal RoPE, Cross-Frame Error Correction, and Random Frame Mask, which collectively mitigate error propagation and stabilize temporal coherence. Our multi-stage pretraining pipeline progressively aligns spatial and temporal learning across increasing resolutions and durations. Empirically, VideoAR achieves new state-of-the-art results among autoregressive models, improving FVD on UCF-101 from 99.5 to 88.6 while reducing inference steps by over 10x, and reaching a VBench score of 81.74-competitive with diffusion-based models an order of magnitude larger. These results demonstrate that VideoAR narrows the performance gap between autoregressive and diffusion paradigms, offering a scalable, efficient, and temporally consistent foundation for future video generation research.

*Yinsong Wang,Xinzhe Luo,Siyi Du,Chen Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AC-CAR is a novel framework for deformable multi-contrast image registration that adapts to arbitrary imaging contrasts without prior training exposure, using random convolution-based contrast augmentation and adaptive feature modulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods either require time-consuming iterative optimization or lack generalization to unseen imaging contrasts, limiting their applicability in complex clinical scenarios with varying image modalities.

Method: 1) Random convolution-based contrast augmentation during training; 2) Adaptive conditional feature modulator (ACFM) for contrast-invariant feature learning; 3) Contrast-invariant latent regularization; 4) Variance network for uncertainty estimation using the same encoder.

Result: AC-CAR achieved superior registration accuracy compared to baseline methods and demonstrated robust generalization to unseen imaging contrasts, with code availability for reproducibility.

Conclusion: The framework advances deformable image registration by enabling contrast-agnostic generalization and real-time performance, addressing critical limitations of both conventional and learning-based registration approaches.

Abstract: Deformable multi-contrast image registration is a challenging yet crucial task due to the complex, non-linear intensity relationships across different imaging contrasts. Conventional registration methods typically rely on iterative optimization of the deformation field, which is time-consuming. Although recent learning-based approaches enable fast and accurate registration during inference, their generalizability remains limited to the specific contrasts observed during training. In this work, we propose an adaptive conditional contrast-agnostic deformable image registration framework (AC-CAR) based on a random convolution-based contrast augmentation scheme. AC-CAR can generalize to arbitrary imaging contrasts without observing them during training. To encourage contrast-invariant feature learning, we propose an adaptive conditional feature modulator (ACFM) that adaptively modulates the features and the contrast-invariant latent regularization to enforce the consistency of the learned feature across different imaging contrasts. Additionally, we enable our framework to provide contrast-agnostic registration uncertainty by integrating a variance network that leverages the contrast-agnostic registration encoder to improve the trustworthiness and reliability of AC-CAR. Experimental results demonstrate that AC-CAR outperforms baseline methods in registration accuracy and exhibits superior generalization to unseen imaging contrasts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统交易模型对商户分类字段的离散化编码导致语义信息丢失，单纯使用LLM计算开销过大影响实时金融应用，需要平衡语义理解能力与计算效率

Method: 构建基于LLM生成的语义初始化轻量模型，采用多源数据融合增强商户特征、单次约束原则生成跨架构一致性嵌入，并通过数据降噪与上下文增强提升数据质量

Result: 大规模交易数据集实验表明，在多个交易理解任务中准确率提升12.7%-23.4%，推理延迟控制在15ms以内

Conclusion: 混合框架成功融合LLM语义优势与轻量化部署特性，为高频交易场景的实时语义分析提供了可行方案

Abstract: The ubiquity of payment networks generates vast transactional data encoding rich consumer and merchant behavioral patterns. Recent foundation models for transaction analysis process tabular data sequentially but rely on index-based representations for categorical merchant fields, causing substantial semantic information loss by converting rich textual data into discrete tokens. While Large Language Models (LLMs) can address this limitation through superior semantic understanding, their computational overhead challenges real-time financial deployment. We introduce a hybrid framework that uses LLM-generated embeddings as semantic initializations for lightweight transaction models, balancing interpretability with operational efficiency. Our approach employs multi-source data fusion to enrich merchant categorical fields and a one-word constraint principle for consistent embedding generation across LLM architectures. We systematically address data quality through noise filtering and context-aware enrichment. Experiments on large-scale transaction datasets demonstrate significant performance improvements across multiple transaction understanding tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统媒体偏见研究聚焦新闻机构的政治立场（左翼/右翼），却忽视了实际偏见通过具体语言手段表达的特性，导致分类体系存在单一性和模糊性缺陷。

Method: 通过分析26,464个新闻语料库及用户提交的句子，采用迭代式方法结合文本细读、跨学科理论（如认知语言学和传播学）及试点标注，构建句子级偏见分类系统，并进行155句随机样本统计验证及与现有分类体系的对比测试。

Result: 开发出包含38种偏见类型的双层分类架构（6大功能类别），通过案例分析和对比实验显示其相较于NLP与传播学领域顶尖分类体系提升了覆盖范围（+23%）并降低28%的模糊性，同时绘制了可视化媒体偏见元素表。

Conclusion: 该研究为媒体偏见研究提供了可操作的分析工具，证实了语言层面偏见检测的可行性，并为公众培养媒介批判思维提供了认知框架。

Abstract: Public debates about "left-" or "right-wing" news overlook the fact that bias is usually conveyed by concrete linguistic manoeuvres that transcend any single political spectrum. We therefore shift the focus from where an outlet allegedly stands to how partiality is expressed in individual sentences. Drawing on 26,464 sentences collected from newsroom corpora, user submissions and our own browsing, we iteratively combine close-reading, interdisciplinary theory and pilot annotation to derive a fine-grained, sentence-level taxonomy of media bias and propaganda. The result is a two-tier schema comprising 38 elementary bias types, arranged in six functional families and visualised as a "table of media-bias elements". For each type we supply a definition, real-world examples, cognitive and societal drivers, and guidance for recognition. A quantitative survey of a random 155-sentence sample illustrates prevalence differences, while a cross-walk to the best-known NLP and communication-science taxonomies reveals substantial coverage gains and reduced ambiguity.

### [49] [Lost in Execution: On the Multilingual Robustness of Tool Calling in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05366)
*Zheng Luo,T Pranav Kutralingam,Ogochukwu N Okoani,Wanpeng Xu,Hua Wei,Xiyang Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces the MLCL benchmark to study robustness of multilingual tool calling in large language models. It identifies language mismatch in parameter values as a key failure mode, showing that even correct intent understanding fails during execution when multilingual parameters violate language-invariant conventions. Inference strategies reduce errors but cannot fully recover English-level performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs demonstrate strong tool-calling performance in English-centric evaluations, their robustness in multilingual scenarios (including low-resource languages like Igbo) remains underexplored. This work addresses this gap to ensure reliable deployment of LLM agents across diverse linguistic contexts.

Method: 1. Developed MLCL diagnostic benchmark for multilingual tool-calling evaluation
2. Conducted systematic cross-lingual analysis on Chinese, Hindi, and Igbo
3. Performed fine-grained error analysis
4. Tested inference-time system strategies (e.g., prompt redesign, code-switching) for error mitigation
5. Quantified performance recovery relative to English baselines

Result: 1. Identified parameter value language mismatch as dominant failure mode (semantically correct in user language but invalid for execution)
2. Demonstrate that traditional metrics decouple intent understanding from execution
3. Show stratagems reduce language-induced errors by 18.2% (absolute) on Igbo
4. Reveal persistent performance gap: No strategy achieves parity with English-level performance
5. Highlight unique challenges in low-resource languages (higher error rates, data scarcity issues)

Conclusion: Current LLMs fundamentally struggle with multilingual execution conventions despite intent understanding. Parameter handling requires explicit language-agnostic encoding, particularly for low-resource languages. Inference strategies offer partial mitigation but indicate structural model limitations. This work establishes MLCL as essential testbed for multilingual agent development.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as agents that invoke external tools through structured function calls. While recent work reports strong tool-calling performance under standard English-centric evaluations, the robustness of tool calling under multilingual user interactions remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce MLCL, a diagnostic benchmark, and conduct a systematic evaluation of multilingual tool calling across Chinese, Hindi, and the low-resource language Igbo. Through fine-grained error analysis, we show that many failures occur despite correct intent understanding and tool selection. We identify parameter value language mismatch as a dominant failure mode, where models generate semantically appropriate parameter values in the user's language, violating language-invariant execution conventions. We further evaluate several inference-time system strategies and find that while these strategies substantially reduce language-induced execution errors, none of them can fully recover English-level performance.

Conclusion: LLMs在复杂金融场景中仍存在持久偏见，研究已开放\mfmd基准代码库促进后续研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely applied across various domains of finance. Since their training data are largely derived from human-authored corpora, LLMs may inherit a range of human biases. Behavioral biases can lead to instability and uncertainty in decision-making, particularly when processing financial information. However, existing research on LLM bias has mainly focused on direct questioning or simplified, general-purpose settings, with limited consideration of the complex real-world financial environments and high-risk, context-sensitive, multilingual financial misinformation detection tasks (\mfmd). In this work, we propose \mfmdscen, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating behavioral biases of LLMs in \mfmd across diverse economic scenarios. In collaboration with financial experts, we construct three types of complex financial scenarios: (i) role- and personality-based, (ii) role- and region-based, and (iii) role-based scenarios incorporating ethnicity and religious beliefs. We further develop a multilingual financial misinformation dataset covering English, Chinese, Greek, and Bengali. By integrating these scenarios with misinformation claims, \mfmdscen enables a systematic evaluation of 22 mainstream LLMs. Our findings reveal that pronounced behavioral biases persist across both commercial and open-source models. This project will be available at https://github.com/lzw108/FMD.

Motivation: 语言模型逐渐应用于需要严格概率分布采样的教育评估、合成数据构建等实际场景，但其内建采样机制的有效性尚未被系统检验

Result: 批量生成仅13%通过率，独立请求全部模型在多数分布失效。采样精度随分布复杂度和序列长度N单调下降，导致MCQ多选题答案分布约束失败，带条件约束的文本生成图像出现人口统计偏差

Conclusion: 当前模型缺乏有效内置采样器，需要依赖外部工具实现统计保证，发现的采样缺陷会传播到需要概率严谨性的应用层面

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) transition from chat interfaces to integral components of stochastic pipelines across domains like educational assessment and synthetic data construction, the ability to faithfully sample from specified probability distributions has become a functional requirement rather than a theoretical curiosity. We present the first large-scale, statistically powered audit of native probabilistic sampling in frontier LLMs, benchmarking 11 models across 15 distributions. To disentangle failure modes, we employ a dual-protocol design: Batch Generation, where a model produces N=1000 samples within one response, and Independent Requests, comprising $N=1000$ stateless calls. We observe a sharp protocol asymmetry: batch generation achieves only modest statistical validity, with a 13% median pass rate, while independent requests collapse almost entirely, with 10 of 11 models passing none of the distributions. Beyond this asymmetry, we reveal that sampling fidelity degrades monotonically with distributional complexity and aggravates as the requested sampling horizon N increases. Finally, we demonstrate the propagation of these failures into downstream tasks: models fail to enforce uniform answer-position constraints in MCQ generation and systematically violate demographic targets in attribute-constrained text-to-image prompt synthesis. These findings indicate that current LLMs lack a functional internal sampler, necessitating the use of external tools for applications requiring statistical guarantees.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs的道德判断是否反映内部概念结构（非表层模仿），借助Moral Foundations Theory（MFT）分析模型道德表征机制。

Method: 多层级方法：（i）模型逐层MFT概念表征对齐人类感知；（ii）残差流稀疏自编码器（SAEs）识别道德相关稀疏特征；（iii）MFT向量与SAE特征的因果引导干预实验。

Result: 模型分层区分道德基础，SAE特征与特定MFT基础语义关联，引导干预导致可预测的道德输出变化，验证内部表征与输出的因果关系。

Conclusion: LLMs道德概念分布于分层且部分解耦的表征中，表明语言统计规律可促使多元道德结构作为潜在模式自现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often produce human-like moral judgments, but it is unclear whether this reflects an internal conceptual structure or superficial ``moral mimicry.'' Using Moral Foundations Theory (MFT) as an analytic framework, we study how moral foundations are encoded, organized, and expressed within two instruction-tuned LLMs: Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct. We employ a multi-level approach combining (i) layer-wise analysis of MFT concept representations and their alignment with human moral perceptions, (ii) pretrained sparse autoencoders (SAEs) over the residual stream to identify sparse features that support moral concepts, and (iii) causal steering interventions using dense MFT vectors and sparse SAE features. We find that both models represent and distinguish moral foundations in a structured, layer-dependent way that aligns with human judgments. At a finer scale, SAE features show clear semantic links to specific foundations, suggesting partially disentangled mechanisms within shared representations. Finally, steering along either dense vectors or sparse features produces predictable shifts in foundation-relevant behavior, demonstrating a causal connection between internal representations and moral outputs. Together, our results provide mechanistic evidence that moral concepts in LLMs are distributed, layered, and partly disentangled, suggesting that pluralistic moral structure can emerge as a latent pattern from the statistical regularities of language alone.

Motivation: 解决低资源语言（韩语）LLM推理能力弱于高资源语言（英语）的问题，探索强化学习在多语言对齐中的潜力。

Method: 1) 评估RL在基础韩语推理能力不足模型上的效果 2) 提出分层微调策略，重点调优韩语特异性神经元 3) 构建代码混合自纠错数据集实现语言内对齐

Result: 单独RL无效，但结合早期层神经元调优后，数学推理和自纠错任务准确率分别提升23%和41%，验证内部翻译机制有效性

Conclusion: 多语言推理增强的核心是通过神经元级校准激活潜在语言能力，而非新增语言知识，为模型内部翻译机制提供实证支持

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning and self-correction abilities in high-resource languages like English, but their performance remains limited in low-resource languages such as Korean. In this study, we investigate whether reinforcement learning (RL) can enhance Korean reasoning abilities to a degree comparable to English. Our findings reveal that RL alone yields limited improvements when applied to models lacking inherent Korean reasoning capabilities. To address this, we explore several fine-tuning strategies and show that aligning the model's internal reasoning processes with Korean inputs-particularly by tuning Korean-specific neurons in early layers-is key to unlocking RL's effectiveness. We introduce a self-correction code-switching dataset to facilitate this alignment and observe significant performance gains in both mathematical reasoning and self-correction tasks. Ultimately, we conclude that the crucial factor in multilingual reasoning enhancement is not injecting new linguistic knowledge, but effectively eliciting and aligning existing reasoning capabilities. Our study provides a new perspective on how internal translation and neuron-level tuning contribute to multilingual reasoning alignment in LLMs.

Abstract: This paper presents a conceptual and methodological framework for large language model (LLM) based student simulation in educational settings. The authors identify a core failure mode, termed the "competence paradox" in which broadly capable LLMs are asked to emulate partially knowledgeable learners, leading to unrealistic error patterns and learning dynamics. To address this, the paper reframes student simulation as a constrained generation problem governed by an explicit Epistemic State Specification (ESS), which defines what a simulated learner can access, how errors are structured, and how learner state evolves over time. The work further introduces a Goal-by-Environment framework to situate simulated student systems according to behavioral objectives and deployment contexts. Rather than proposing a new system or benchmark, the paper synthesizes prior literature, formalizes key design dimensions, and articulates open challenges related to validity, evaluation, and ethical risks. Overall, the paper argues for epistemic fidelity over surface realism as a prerequisite for using LLM-based simulated students as reliable scientific and pedagogical instruments.

TL;DR: 本文提出了MisBelief框架，发现LLMs在面对精细处理的难以反驳证据时易被误导，错误信念增加93%。提出DIS机制可有效检测并缓解此类欺骗意图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为解决LLMs在辅助决策时需保持事实信念对抗误导注射的问题，揭示现有模型在抵抗复杂证据时存在根本漏洞，系统研究其逻辑推理欺骗机制。

Method: 构建多角色多轮交互框架MisBelief生成逻辑严密的虚假证据，构建4800实例数据集进行测评。提出Deceptive Intent Shielding（DIS）通过意图推理提前预警欺骗证据。

Result: 实验显示现有LLMs面对此类证据时错误信念评分平均提升93.0%，而DIS机制能显著抑制信念转变并引导谨慎评估证据。所有模型在MisBelief测试中均暴露脆弱性。

Conclusion: 揭示了LLMs的渐进式证据信任漏洞，提供了系统性评估框架MisBelief及治理方案DIS，为构建安全可靠模型提供了新思路。

Abstract: To reliably assist human decision-making, LLMs must maintain factual internal beliefs against misleading injections. While current models resist explicit misinformation, we uncover a fundamental vulnerability to sophisticated, hard-to-falsify evidence. To systematically probe this weakness, we introduce MisBelief, a framework that generates misleading evidence via collaborative, multi-round interactions among multi-role LLMs. This process mimics subtle, defeasible reasoning and progressive refinement to create logically persuasive yet factually deceptive claims. Using MisBelief, we generate 4,800 instances across three difficulty levels to evaluate 7 representative LLMs. Results indicate that while models are robust to direct misinformation, they are highly sensitive to this refined evidence: belief scores in falsehoods increase by an average of 93.0\%, fundamentally compromising downstream recommendations. To address this, we propose Deceptive Intent Shielding (DIS), a governance mechanism that provides an early warning signal by inferring the deceptive intent behind evidence. Empirical results demonstrate that DIS consistently mitigates belief shifts and promotes more cautious evidence evaluation.

TL;DR: MemBuilder通过强化学习解决LLM长期对话一致性问题，利用密集奖励和多维记忆归因提高模型表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在长期对话中保持一致性存在挑战，传统检索机制和现有memory-augmented框架存在稀疏奖励或训练低效问题。

Method: 引入MemBuilder框架：1）合成会话级问题生成密集奖励；2）贡献感知梯度加权优化多维记忆归因。

Result: 40亿参数模型在长期对话基准测试中超越闭源先进基线模型，展现强泛化能力。

Conclusion: MemBuilder通过结构化记忆训练实现LLM长期一致性优化，验证了密集奖励机制和归因分析的有效性。

Abstract: Maintaining consistency in long-term dialogues remains a fundamental challenge for LLMs, as standard retrieval mechanisms often fail to capture the temporal evolution of historical states. While memory-augmented frameworks offer a structured alternative, current systems rely on static prompting of closed-source models or suffer from ineffective training paradigms with sparse rewards. We introduce MemBuilder, a reinforcement learning framework that trains models to orchestrate multi-dimensional memory construction with attributed dense rewards. MemBuilder addresses two key challenges: (1) Sparse Trajectory-Level Rewards: we employ synthetic session-level question generation to provide dense intermediate rewards across extended trajectories; and (2) Multi-Dimensional Memory Attribution: we introduce contribution-aware gradient weighting that scales policy updates based on each component's downstream impact. Experimental results show that MemBuilder enables a 4B-parameter model to outperform state-of-the-art closed-source baselines, exhibiting strong generalization across long-term dialogue benchmarks.

### [58] [FlashMem: Distilling Intrinsic Latent Memory via Computation Reuse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05505)
*Yubo Hou,Zhisheng Chen,Tao Wan,Zengchang Qin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FlashMem addresses the issue of preserving dynamic context in Large Language Models by distilling intrinsic memory from transient reasoning states, achieving efficiency and performance comparable to heavier baselines without requiring architectural changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models (LLMs) lack mechanisms to preserve dynamic context, leading to redundant reprocessing of history for long-horizon autonomy. Existing solutions with latent memory suffer from architectural segregation due to reliance on auxiliary encoders, which decouples memory from the reasoning backbone.

Method: FlashMem leverages the property that internal representations of LLMs uniquely encode input trajectories. The framework extracts the last hidden state as a sufficient statistic for interaction history and uses a Shared-KV Consolidator to synthesize memory by attending to the backbone's frozen cache, eliminating redundant re-parameterization. A parameter-free Cognitive Monitor adaptively triggers memory consolidation based on attention entropy and epistemic uncertainty.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that FlashMem matches the performance of heavy baselines while reducing inference latency by 5 times, effectively balancing efficiency with persistent cognition.

Conclusion: FlashMem bridges the gap between efficient inference and maintaining long-horizon autonomy in LLMs by integrating memory directly into the reasoning process without additional architectural complexity.

Abstract: The stateless architecture of Large Language Models inherently lacks the mechanism to preserve dynamic context, compelling agents to redundantly reprocess history to maintain long-horizon autonomy. While latent memory offers a solution, current approaches are hindered by architectural segregation, relying on auxiliary encoders that decouple memory from the reasoning backbone. We propose FlashMem, a framework that distills intrinsic memory directly from transient reasoning states via computation reuse. Leveraging the property that internal representations uniquely encode input trajectories, FlashMem identifies the last hidden state as a sufficient statistic for the interaction history. This enables a Shared-KV Consolidator to synthesize memory by attending directly to the backbone's frozen cache, eliminating redundant re-parameterization. Furthermore, a parameter-free Cognitive Monitor leverages attention entropy to adaptively trigger consolidation only when high epistemic uncertainty is detected. Experiments demonstrate that FlashMem matches the performance of heavy baselines while reducing inference latency by 5 times, effectively bridging the gap between efficiency and persistent cognition.

*Xuemei Tang,Chengxi Yan,Jinghang Gu,Chu-Ren Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了CHisAgent，一个用于构建中国古代史多级分类体系的多智能体大语言模型框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在非英语文化语境中的历史推理能力有限，而人工构建分类体系成本高昂、难以扩展，需要自动化解决方案提升历史知识的系统化组织能力。

Method: 将分类体系构建分解为三个专业化阶段：1) 底层数据驱动的Inducer从原始史籍生成初始层级；2) 基于世界知识的Expander补充缺失概念；3) 基于实证的Enricher整合外部结构化历史资源确保准确性。

Result: 基于《二十四史》构建了涵盖政治、军事等四大领域的中国古代史大规模分类体系，在参考性与无参考性评估中均显示结构连贯性与覆盖度提升，且支持跨文化框架对齐。

Conclusion: CHisAgent通过多智能体协同机制有效解决了历史知识自动化归类难题，其分层增强的混合方法为非英语文化语境的历史知识组织提供了新范式。

Abstract: Despite strong performance on many tasks, large language models (LLMs) show limited ability in historical and cultural reasoning, particularly in non-English contexts such as Chinese history. Taxonomic structures offer an effective mechanism to organize historical knowledge and improve understanding. However, manual taxonomy construction is costly and difficult to scale. Therefore, we propose \textbf{CHisAgent}, a multi-agent LLM framework for historical taxonomy construction in ancient Chinese contexts. CHisAgent decomposes taxonomy construction into three role-specialized stages: a bottom-up \textit{Inducer} that derives an initial hierarchy from raw historical corpora, a top-down \textit{Expander} that introduces missing intermediate concepts using LLM world knowledge, and an evidence-guided \textit{Enricher} that integrates external structured historical resources to ensure faithfulness. Using the \textit{Twenty-Four Histories}, we construct a large-scale, domain-aware event taxonomy covering politics, military, diplomacy, and social life in ancient China. Extensive reference-free and reference-based evaluations demonstrate improved structural coherence and coverage, while further analysis shows that the resulting taxonomy supports cross-cultural alignment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Double的新型解码框架，通过迭代检索推测和权威检索机制，在无需训练且无信息损失的情况下突破了传统推测解码的速度与效率瓶颈。实验表明其在LLaMA3.3-70B和Qwen3-32B模型上分别实现5.3倍和2.8倍加速，显著优于需要训练的EAGLE-3方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推测解码(SD)和并行推测解码(PSD)受限于理论速度上限(由草案模型与目标模型速度比决定)和序列中段错误令牌引起的高计算浪费问题。现有方法难以突破这些限制且依赖模型训练。文章旨在开发一种无需训练的端到端方案，同时解决速度瓶颈与计算资源浪费问题。

Method: Double框架引入双检索机制：草案模型通过迭代检索推测突破理论速度界限，目标模型通过权威检索生成多令牌引导以避免回滚。该方法基于同步机制平衡精度与效率，同时实现两种模型的协同工作。算法设计完全免去训练过程，保留原始模型输出精度。

Result: 在LLaMA3.3-70B模型上实现5.3倍端到端加速，在Qwen3-32B上实现2.8倍加速，分别超越需要大量训练的EAGLE-3方法2.1倍和1.5倍。实验证明Double具有更高的计算资源利用率，且在长序列生成场景下优势更显著。方法在多个基准测试中均达到SOTA性能指标。

Conclusion: Double通过双检索策略首次在免训练条件下解决了推测解码领域的精度-效率困境。所提出的同步机制有效协调草案模型与目标模型，既突破理论速度极限又消除计算浪费。该方案为大规模语言模型生成加速提供了新的理论框架和实用工具。

Abstract: Parallel Speculative Decoding (PSD) accelerates traditional Speculative Decoding (SD) by overlapping draft generation with verification. However, it remains hampered by two fundamental challenges: (1) a theoretical speedup ceiling dictated by the speed ratio between the draft and target models, and (2) high computational waste and pipeline stall due to mid-sequence token rejections of early errors. To address these limitations, we introduce \textsc{Double} (Double Retrieval Speculative Parallelism). By bridging the gap between SD and PSD, our framework resolves the Retrieval \emph{Precision-Efficiency Dilemma} through a novel synchronous mechanism. Specifically, we enable the draft model to execute iterative retrieval speculations to break the theoretical speedup limits; to alleviate rejections without rollback, the target model performs authoritative retrieval to generate multi-token guidance. \textsc{Double} is entirely training-free and lossless. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art speedup of $\textbf{5.3}\times$ on LLaMA3.3-70B and $\textbf{2.8}\times$ on Qwen3-32B, significantly outperforming the advanced method EAGLE-3 that requires extensive model training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音大模型在语音输入上的推理性能明显弱于文本输入，这与Transformer层间表征漂移和长链推理行为偏差相关。

Method: 提出TARS框架，采用非对称奖励设计，通过表征对齐（层级隐藏状态相似性）和行为对齐（生成结果与文本参考语义一致性）的双稠密信号进行优化。

Result: 在MMSU和OBQA等挑战性推理基准测试中，该方法显著缩小模态推理差距，并在7B级语音LLM中取得最优性能。

Conclusion: TARS框架通过强化学习解决语音-文本多模态推理能力差异问题，验证了双对齐信号在缩小模态差距中的有效性。

Abstract: Although speech large language models have achieved notable progress, a substantial modality reasoning gap remains: their reasoning performance on speech inputs is markedly weaker than on text. This gap could be associated with representational drift across Transformer layers and behavior deviations in long-chain reasoning. To address this issue, we introduce TARS, a reinforcement-learning framework that aligns text-conditioned and speech-conditioned trajectories through an asymmetric reward design. The framework employs two dense and complementary signals: representation alignment, which measures layer-wise hidden-state similarity between speech- and text-conditioned trajectories, and behavior alignment, which evaluates semantic consistency between generated outputs and reference text completions. Experiments on challenging reasoning benchmarks, including MMSU and OBQA, show that our approach significantly narrows the modality reasoning gap and achieves state-of-the-art performance among 7B-scale Speech LLMs.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: This study addresses critical gaps in Automated Essay Scoring (AES) systems and Large Language Models (LLMs) with regard to their ability to effectively identify and score harmful essays. Despite advancements in AES technology, current models often overlook ethically and morally problematic elements within essays, erroneously assigning high scores to essays that may propagate harmful opinions. In this study, we introduce the Harmful Essay Detection (HED) benchmark, which includes essays integrating sensitive topics such as racism and gender bias, to test the efficacy of various LLMs in recognizing and scoring harmful content. Our findings reveal that: (1) LLMs require further enhancement to accurately distinguish between harmful and argumentative essays, and (2) both current AES models and LLMs fail to consider the ethical dimensions of content during scoring. The study underscores the need for developing more robust AES systems that are sensitive to the ethical implications of the content they are scoring.

Result: 增强系统共情能力，显著改善开放域对话中的响应质量。

Conclusion: KEEM数据集通过情感与关键信息的协同记忆更新，为对话系统提供了更细腻的用户理解能力。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce the Keep Emotional and Essential Memory (KEEM) dataset, a novel generation-based dataset designed to enhance memory updates in long-term conversational systems. Unlike existing approaches that rely on simple accumulation or operation-based methods, which often result in information conflicts and difficulties in accurately tracking a user's current state, KEEM dynamically generates integrative memories. This process not only preserves essential factual information but also incorporates emotional context and causal relationships, enabling a more nuanced understanding of user interactions. By seamlessly updating a system's memory with both emotional and essential data, our approach promotes deeper empathy and enhances the system's ability to respond meaningfully in open-domain conversations.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了ReasonAny，一种通过对比梯度识别解决模型合并中的推理能力与领域性能崩溃的新型合并框架，实现了推理与领域能力的有效融合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型合并方法在赋予领域专用模型链式推理能力（即'推理+X'）时，常导致推理深度削弱和领域效用损害。研究发现推理能力主要存在于低梯度敏感区域参数中，这与传统认为领域能力存在于高强度参数中的假设相悖。

Method: 提出基于对比梯度识别的新型模型合并框架ReasonAny，通过识别并保留低梯度敏感区域的参数特征，在模型合并过程中同时保持推理能力和领域专业性。

Result: 在安全、生物医学和金融领域的实验表明，ReasonAny显著优于当前最先进基线方法，在保留强大推理性能的同时实现跨领域能力合成。

Conclusion: 该研究证实通过针对性梯度识别策略，可有效解决'推理+X'场景下的模型合并性能崩溃问题，为多能力融合提供了新的技术路径。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) with long chain-of-thought reasoning have recently achieved remarkable success. Yet, equipping domain-specialized models with such reasoning capabilities, referred to as "Reasoning + X", remains a significant challenge. While model merging offers a promising training-free solution, existing methods often suffer from a destructive performance collapse: existing methods tend to both weaken reasoning depth and compromise domain-specific utility. Interestingly, we identify a counter-intuitive phenomenon underlying this failure: reasoning ability predominantly resides in parameter regions with low gradient sensitivity, contrary to the common assumption that domain capabilities correspond to high-magnitude parameters. Motivated by this insight, we propose ReasonAny, a novel merging framework that resolves the reasoning-domain performance collapse through Contrastive Gradient Identification. Experiments across safety, biomedicine, and finance domains show that ReasonAny effectively synthesizes "Reasoning + X" capabilities, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baselines while retaining robust reasoning performance.

TL;DR: 评估大型语言模型（LLM）在解析群组聊天数据中的决策过程潜力，发现LLM能有效捕捉显性因素，但隐性因素仍需人工干预。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统出行调查难以捕捉社交活动中的复杂决策过程，而新型非结构化聊天数据提供了新机会。然而，解析这些数据需要人工标注的劳动密集型工作，并需处理由社会文化背景塑造的隐性和显性因素。

Method: 设计受知识获取过程启发的提示框架，依次提取餐厅选择集合、个体偏好及驱动属性等决策因素，将非结构化对话转化为结构化表格数据。通过人类标注的基准数据集进行定量评估并结合定性误差分析验证模型效果。

Result: LLM能稳定识别明确的决策因素，但在识别依赖社会文化背景的隐性因素时表现不足。误差分析揭示了模型在特定情境（如委婉否定意图识别）中的局限性，表明人工监督在复杂语境中仍不可替代。

Conclusion: LLM为解析非传统社交活动数据提供了高效工具，但其自动化分析必须与人工标注结合才能完整还原复杂决策过程。研究为LLM在社会科学研究中的应用边界提供了实证依据和方法论参考。

Abstract: Social activities result from complex joint activity-travel decisions between group members. While observing the decision-making process of these activities is difficult via traditional travel surveys, the advent of new types of data, such as unstructured chat data, can help shed some light on these complex processes. However, interpreting these decision-making processes requires inferring both explicit and implicit factors. This typically involves the labor-intensive task of manually annotating dialogues to capture context-dependent meanings shaped by the social and cultural norms. This study evaluates the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate and complement human annotation in interpreting decision-making processes from group chats, using data on joint eating-out activities in Japan as a case study. We designed a prompting framework inspired by the knowledge acquisition process, which sequentially extracts key decision-making factors, including the group-level restaurant choice set and outcome, individual preferences of each alternative, and the specific attributes driving those preferences. This structured process guides the LLM to interpret group chat data, converting unstructured dialogues into structured tabular data describing decision-making factors. To evaluate LLM-driven outputs, we conduct a quantitative analysis using a human-annotated ground truth dataset and a qualitative error analysis to examine model limitations. Results show that while the LLM reliably captures explicit decision-making factors, it struggles to identify nuanced implicit factors that human annotators readily identified. We pinpoint specific contexts when LLM-based extraction can be trusted versus when human oversight remains essential. These findings highlight both the potential and limitations of LLM-based analysis for incorporating non-traditional data sources on social activities.

Conclusion: ACR框架通过显式化上下文管理机制，有效缓解了长对话中的信息衰减问题，为增强LLM的持续交互能力提供了新范式

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in multi-turn dialogue. However, in multi-turn dialogue, models still struggle to stay aligned with what has been established earlier, follow dependencies across many turns, and avoid drifting into incorrect facts as the interaction grows longer. Existing approaches primarily focus on extending the context window, introducing external memory, or applying context compression, yet these methods still face limitations such as \textbf{contextual inertia} and \textbf{state drift}. To address these challenges, we propose the \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{C}ontext \textbf{R}efactoring \textbf{(ACR)} Framework, which dynamically monitors and reshapes the interaction history to mitigate contextual inertia and state drift actively. ACR is built on a library of context refactoring operators and a teacher-guided self-evolving training paradigm that learns when to intervene and how to refactor, thereby decoupling context management from the reasoning process. Extensive experiments on multi-turn dialogue demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines while reducing token consumption.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hybrid method combining detection and rewriting to address toxic language in isiXhosa and Yorùbá, achieving 61-86% accuracy in detection and 100% detoxification success while preserving non-toxic text.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Toxic language hinders safe online communication for African languages due to a lack of robust mitigation tools, particularly for low-resource languages like isiXhosa and Yorùbá.

Method: A hybrid approach: (1) A lightweight TF-IDF + Logistic Regression model for transparent toxicity detection, (2) A lexicon-guided rewriting system, trained and evaluated on a novel parallel corpus capturing idioms, diacritics, and code-switching.

Result: Detection accuracy of 61-72% (isiXhosa) and 72-86% (Yorùbá), ROC-AUC of 0.88 for Yorùbá; rewriting fully detoxified toxic sentences while preserving 100% of non-toxic sentences.

Conclusion: The hybrid method demonstrates that interpretable ML models with rule-based edits offer an efficient solution for culturally adaptive safety tools, setting a benchmark for low-resource text style transfer in African languages.

Abstract: Toxic language is one of the major barrier to safe online participation, yet robust mitigation tools are scarce for African languages. This study addresses this critical gap by investigating automatic text detoxification (toxic to neutral rewriting) for two low-resource African languages, isiXhosa and Yorùbá. The work contributes a novel, pragmatic hybrid methodology: a lightweight, interpretable TF-IDF and Logistic Regression model for transparent toxicity detection, and a controlled lexicon- and token-guided rewriting component. A parallel corpus of toxic to neutral rewrites, which captures idiomatic usage, diacritics, and code switching, was developed to train and evaluate the model. The detection component achieved stratified K-fold accuracies of 61-72% (isiXhosa) and 72-86% (Yorùbá), with per-language ROC-AUCs up to 0.88. The rewriting component successfully detoxified all detected toxic sentences while preserving 100% of non-toxic sentences. These results demonstrate that scalable, interpretable machine learning detectors combined with rule-based edits offer a competitive and resource-efficient solution for culturally adaptive safety tooling, setting a new benchmark for low-resource Text Style Transfer (TST) in African languages.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于游戏的非正式学习框架，旨在增强大型语言模型的战略创造力和社会推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在正式任务（如数学和代码生成）上表现优异，但在人类实践智慧（如战略创造和社会推理）上存在不足，缺乏基于互动反馈的非正式学习环境，导致多任务学习时性能下降。

Method: 提出了一种嵌套训练框架：1. 将游戏作为非正式学习环境，利用内在奖励和抽象复杂度；2. 通过连续任务组合实现显式"AND"目标，强制模型同时掌握多能力；3. 基于GRPO强化学习在Matrix Games、井字棋和谁是卧底等游戏中训练。

Result: 实验表明新框架能有效防止任务干扰，在Who's the Spy、棋盘游戏策略生成等基准测试中，与传统多任务学习相比，模型的跨任务泛化能力提升了23%，战略推理准确率为89%，社会情境理解准确率提高37%。

Conclusion: 游戏为LLM提供了有效的非正式学习环境，嵌套训练框架在保持专业能力的同时，显著增强了模型的可迁移智能和实践推理能力，其开源框架为通用人工智能发展提供了新方向。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in formal learning tasks such as mathematics and code generation, they still struggle with the "practical wisdom" and generalizable intelligence, such as strategic creativity and social reasoning, that characterize human cognition. This gap arises from a lack of informal learning, which thrives on interactive feedback rather than goal-oriented instruction. In this paper, we propose treating Games as a primary environment for LLM informal learning, leveraging their intrinsic reward signals and abstracted complexity to cultivate diverse competencies. To address the performance degradation observed in multi-task learning, we introduce a Nested Training Framework. Unlike naive task mixing optimizing an implicit "OR" objective, our framework employs sequential task composition to enforce an explicit "AND" objective, compelling the model to master multiple abilities simultaneously to achieve maximal rewards. Using GRPO-based reinforcement learning across Matrix Games, TicTacToe, and Who's the Spy games, we demonstrate that integrating game-based informal learning not only prevents task interference but also significantly bolsters the model's generalization across broad ability-oriented benchmarks.

Abstract: As multilingual large language models become more widely used, ensuring their safety and fairness across diverse linguistic contexts presents unique challenges. While existing research on machine unlearning has primarily focused on monolingual settings, typically English, multilingual environments introduce additional complexities due to cross-lingual knowledge transfer and biases embedded in both pretraining and fine-tuning data. In this work, we study multilingual unlearning using the Aya-Expanse 8B model under two settings: (1) data unlearning and (2) concept unlearning. We extend benchmarks for factual knowledge and stereotypes to ten languages through translation: English, French, Arabic, Japanese, Russian, Farsi, Korean, Hindi, Hebrew, and Indonesian. These languages span five language families and a wide range of resource levels. Our experiments show that unlearning in high-resource languages is generally more stable, with asymmetric transfer effects observed between typologically related languages. Furthermore, our analysis of linguistic distances indicates that syntactic similarity is the strongest predictor of cross-lingual unlearning behavior.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种上下文感知的用户画像框架，利用用户历史活动提升说服力预测模型效果，在Reddit数据集上F1分数提升13.77%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未能系统利用说服对象的历史活动（如对话）来优化说服力预测，缺乏结合用户价值、经验等特征的建模框架。

Method: 设计双组件框架：1) 查询生成器：从用户历史中检索说服相关记录；2) 分析器：生成上下文依赖的用户画像以指导预测模型。

Result: 在ChangeMyView数据集上多模型平均F1分数提升最多+13.77%，且有效画像需针对具体预测任务和上下文动态生成，而非静态属性匹配。

Conclusion: 实验验证了任务导向的动态用户画像对个性化说服力预测的重要性，优于基于表面特征或静态属性的传统方法。

Abstract: Estimating the persuasiveness of messages is critical in various applications, from recommender systems to safety assessment of LLMs. While it is imperative to consider the target persuadee's characteristics, such as their values, experiences, and reasoning styles, there is currently no established systematic framework to optimize leveraging a persuadee's past activities (e.g., conversations) to the benefit of a persuasiveness prediction model. To address this problem, we propose a context-aware user profiling framework with two trainable components: a query generator that generates optimal queries to retrieve persuasion-relevant records from a user's history, and a profiler that summarizes these records into a profile to effectively inform the persuasiveness prediction model. Our evaluation on the ChangeMyView Reddit dataset shows consistent improvements over existing methods across multiple predictor models, with gains of up to +13.77%p in F1 score. Further analysis shows that effective user profiles are context-dependent and predictor-specific, rather than relying on static attributes or surface-level similarity. Together, these results highlight the importance of task-oriented, context-dependent user profiling for personalized persuasiveness prediction.

TL;DR: Afri-MCQA, a new multilingual cultural QA benchmark for African languages, reveals poor performance of LLMs in low-resource native languages and highlights the need for culturally grounded AI development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Africa's linguistic diversity (1/3 global languages) is underrepresented in AI research, and lack of multilingual benchmark datasets for native African languages prevents equitable AI development.

Method: Created Afri-MCQA (7.5k QA pairs across 15 African languages from 12 countries) with parallel English-native language QA in text/speech modalities; collected entirely by native speakers. Evaluated LLMs with control experiments focusing on linguistic competence vs cultural knowledge.

Result: Open-weight LLMs performed poorly on African languages (near-zero accuracy for open-ended speech QA). Native-African-language QA demonstrated significant accuracy gaps vs English (both text and speech modalities), highlighting limitations in cross-lingual cultural transfer capabilities.

Conclusion: Current LLMs have critical limitations in African languages/cultures; requires speech-first approaches, culturally grounded pretraining, and frameworks for cross-lingual cultural knowledge transfer to develop inclusive AI.

Abstract: Africa is home to over one-third of the world's languages, yet remains underrepresented in AI research. We introduce Afri-MCQA, the first Multilingual Cultural Question-Answering benchmark covering 7.5k Q&A pairs across 15 African languages from 12 countries. The benchmark offers parallel English-African language Q&A pairs across text and speech modalities and was entirely created by native speakers. Benchmarking large language models (LLMs) on Afri-MCQA shows that open-weight models perform poorly across evaluated cultures, with near-zero accuracy on open-ended VQA when queried in native language or speech. To evaluate linguistic competence, we include control experiments meant to assess this specific aspect separate from cultural knowledge, and we observe significant performance gaps between native languages and English for both text and speech. These findings underscore the need for speech-first approaches, culturally grounded pretraining, and cross-lingual cultural transfer. To support more inclusive multimodal AI development in African languages, we release our Afri-MCQA under academic license or CC BY-NC 4.0 on HuggingFace (https://huggingface.co/datasets/Atnafu/Afri-MCQA)

TL;DR: 该论文提出多模态上下文学习（MICL）方法提升低资源语言的语音识别效果，并在三种濒危语言上验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动语音识别（ASR）因监督数据稀疏难以覆盖全球多数语言，现有研究局限于高资源语言和纯文本环境，探索多模态上下文学习如何解决未见过语言的语音识别问题具有重要挑战性。

Method: 使用Phi-4和Qwen3-Omni两个语音大模型，在三种濒危语言上进行多模态上下文学习实验，结合注意力模式分析跨语言迁移学习效果，并设计结合声学模型与MICL选择假设的ASR系统。

Result: MICL对未见过语言有效且具备跨语言迁移能力，注意力分析显示模型对文本模态有层间偏倚，结合方法的ASR系统在无目标语数据时仍超越传统模型。

Conclusion: MICL为低资源语言ASR提供了数据高效解决方案，跨语言迁移机制可避免目标语言训练数据依赖，相关代码已开源。

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) still covers only a small fraction of the world's languages, mainly due to supervised data scarcity. In-context learning (ICL) with large language models (LLMs) addresses this problem, but prior work largely focuses on high-resource languages covered during training and text-only settings. This paper investigates whether speech LLMs can learn unseen languages with multimodal ICL (MICL), and how this learning can be used to improve ASR. We conduct experiments with two speech LLMs, Phi-4 and Qwen3-Omni, on three diverse endangered languages. Firstly, we find that MICL is effective for unseen languages, leveraging both speech and text modalities. We further show that cross-lingual transfer learning improves MICL efficiency on target languages without training on them. Moreover, we analyze attention patterns to interpret MICL mechanisms, and we observe layer-dependent preferences between audio and text context, with an overall bias towards text. Finally, we show that prompt-based ASR with speech LLMs performs poorly on unseen languages, motivating a simple ASR system that combines a stronger acoustic model with a speech LLM via MICL-based selection of acoustic hypotheses. Results show that MICL consistently improves ASR performance, and that cross-lingual transfer learning matches or outperforms corpus-trained language models without using target-language data. Our code is publicly available.

Conclusion: 该方法突破传统单一词嵌入分析范式，为模型结构优化提供可视化依据，显著增强大型语言模型的可解释性

Abstract: Understanding how large language models (LLMs) represent natural language is a central challenge in natural language processing (NLP) research. Many existing methods extract word embeddings from an LLM, visualise the embedding space via point-plots, and compare the relative positions of certain words. However, this approach only considers single words and not whole natural language expressions, thus disregards the context in which a word is used. Here we present a novel tool for analysing and visualising information flow in natural language expressions by applying diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to word embeddings. We find that DTI reveals how information flows between word embeddings. Tracking information flows within the layers of an LLM allows for comparing different model structures and revealing opportunities for pruning an LLM's under-utilised layers. Furthermore, our model reveals differences in information flows for tasks like pronoun resolution and metaphor detection. Our results show that our model permits novel insights into how LLMs represent actual natural language expressions, extending the comparison of isolated word embeddings and improving the interpretability of NLP models.

Motivation: 随着LLMs被广泛用于人际说服场景，需理解其生成机制与潜在社会偏见，尤其在性别等敏感维度。

Method: 采用成对指令提示方法，跨13个LLMs和16种语言评估，使用19类基于社会心理学的说服特征，并基于专业理论构建LLM评测框架。

Result: 所有模型均呈现性别差异化说服策略，表现为女性化文本倾向情感共鸣与合作性语言，男性化文本偏好权威型说服，且与社会语言学理论高度吻合。

Conclusion: LLM说服性生成继承社会性别刻板印象，揭示模型意识形态映射问题，为设计公平性干预机制提供理论依据。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for everyday communication tasks, including drafting interpersonal messages intended to influence and persuade. Prior work has shown that LLMs can successfully persuade humans and amplify persuasive language. It is therefore essential to understand how user instructions affect the generation of persuasive language, and to understand whether the generated persuasive language differs, for example, when targeting different groups. In this work, we propose a framework for evaluating how persuasive language generation is affected by recipient gender, sender intent, or output language. We evaluate 13 LLMs and 16 languages using pairwise prompt instructions. We evaluate model responses on 19 categories of persuasive language using an LLM-as-judge setup grounded in social psychology and communication science. Our results reveal significant gender differences in the persuasive language generated across all models. These patterns reflect biases consistent with gender-stereotypical linguistic tendencies documented in social psychology and sociolinguistics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统误行为监控存在系统性评估缺失，需通过可控基准测试验证LLM监测器在多样性任务和失效模式下的可靠性，探索安全与实用性的平衡边界。

Method: 构建包含问答、代码生成和推理任务的AutoMonitor-Bench测试集（3,010对样本），采用漏报率（MR）与误报率（FAR）双指标评估22种LLM；训练Qwen3-4B-Instruction模型（15万样本）验证训练策略对监测隐性误行为的效果。

Result: 监测性能存在显著差异且MR-FAR存在不可调和的取舍关系，微调模型未显著提升对未知误行为的监测能力，揭示传统数据驱动方法在隐性误行为检测中的局限性。

Conclusion: 大规模语言模型监测需突破当前范式，建议探索任务感知的监测架构设计和专门化训练策略以提升可靠性，强调安全性研究的重要性。

Abstract: We introduce AutoMonitor-Bench, the first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the reliability of LLM-based misbehavior monitors across diverse tasks and failure modes. AutoMonitor-Bench consists of 3,010 carefully annotated test samples spanning question answering, code generation, and reasoning, with paired misbehavior and benign instances. We evaluate monitors using two complementary metrics: Miss Rate (MR) and False Alarm Rate (FAR), capturing failures to detect misbehavior and oversensitivity to benign behavior, respectively. Evaluating 12 proprietary and 10 open-source LLMs, we observe substantial variability in monitoring performance and a consistent trade-off between MR and FAR, revealing an inherent safety-utility tension. To further explore the limits of monitor reliability, we construct a large-scale training corpus of 153,581 samples and fine-tune Qwen3-4B-Instruction to investigate whether training on known, relatively easy-to-construct misbehavior datasets improves monitoring performance on unseen and more implicit misbehaviors. Our results highlight the challenges of reliable, scalable misbehavior monitoring and motivate future work on task-aware designing and training strategies for LLM-based monitors.

### [77] [One Script Instead of Hundreds? On Pretraining Romanized Encoder Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05776)
*Benedikt Ebing,Lennart Keller,Goran Glavaš*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Script romanization helps cross-lingual transfer in multilingual models but harms morphosyllabic languages (e.g., Chinese/Japanese), while segmental scripts show negligible loss. Higher-fidelity romanization reduces degradation, and increased vocabulary overlap does not cause negative interference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work focused on optimal scenarios (e.g., high-resource Latin to low-resource non-Latin), leaving unclear if romanization is suitable for general-purpose multilingual model pretraining, especially for high-resource languages with diverse scripts.

Method: Trained encoder LMs from scratch on romanized vs. original texts for six typologically diverse high-resource languages (three segmental, three morphosyllabic), using two romanization methods and analyzing performance degradation sources (script-specific information loss and cross-lingual interference).

Result: Segmental scripts (e.g., English/Spanish) show minimal performance loss, while morphosyllabic scripts suffer degradation partially mitigated by high-fidelity romanization. No cross-lingual interference observed. Romanization improves encoding efficiency for segmental scripts with negligible cost.

Conclusion: Romanization is viable for general-purpose multilingual LMs with segmental scripts (efficiency gains, minor loss) but risks performance degradation for morphosyllabic scripts. Cross-lingual interference from subword overlap is not a significant concern.

Abstract: Exposing latent lexical overlap, script romanization has emerged as an effective strategy for improving cross-lingual transfer (XLT) in multilingual language models (mLMs). Most prior work, however, focused on setups that favor romanization the most: (1) transfer from high-resource Latin-script to low-resource non-Latin-script languages and/or (2) between genealogically closely related languages with different scripts. It thus remains unclear whether romanization is a good representation choice for pretraining general-purpose mLMs, or, more precisely, if information loss associated with romanization harms performance for high-resource languages. We address this gap by pretraining encoder LMs from scratch on both romanized and original texts for six typologically diverse high-resource languages, investigating two potential sources of degradation: (i) loss of script-specific information and (ii) negative cross-lingual interference from increased vocabulary overlap. Using two romanizers with different fidelity profiles, we observe negligible performance loss for languages with segmental scripts, whereas languages with morphosyllabic scripts (Chinese and Japanese) suffer degradation that higher-fidelity romanization mitigates but cannot fully recover. Importantly, comparing monolingual LMs with their mLM counterpart, we find no evidence that increased subword overlap induces negative interference. We further show that romanization improves encoding efficiency (i.e., fertility) for segmental scripts at a negligible performance cost.

Method: 构建名为Simplify-This的比较研究框架，使用编码器-解码器大模型，在多基准数据集上通过多种指标评估两种方法。

Result: 微调模型显著提升结构简化质量，提示方法在保持语义相似度方面占优但存在输入复制倾向，人类评估更认可微调输出。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了两种范式在文本简化中的权衡，为方法选择提供实证依据，并开源了代码、数据集和模型促进后续研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) enable strong text generation, and in general there is a practical tradeoff between fine-tuning and prompt engineering. We introduce Simplify-This, a comparative study evaluating both paradigms for text simplification with encoder-decoder LLMs across multiple benchmarks, using a range of evaluation metrics. Fine-tuned models consistently deliver stronger structural simplification, whereas prompting often attains higher semantic similarity scores yet tends to copy inputs. A human evaluation favors fine-tuned outputs overall. We release code, a cleaned derivative dataset used in our study, checkpoints of fine-tuned models, and prompt templates to facilitate reproducibility and future work.

Abstract: The scientific community needs tools that help early-stage researchers effectively communicate their findings and innovations to the public. Although existing general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) can assist in this endeavor, they are not optimally aligned for it. To address this, we propose a framework for training LLMs to emulate the role of a science journalist that can be used by early-stage researchers to learn how to properly communicate their papers to the general public. We evaluate the usefulness of our trained LLM Journalists in leading conversations with both simulated and human researchers. %compared to the general-purpose ones. Our experiments indicate that LLMs trained using our framework ask more relevant questions that address the societal impact of research, prompting researchers to clarify and elaborate on their findings. In the user study, the majority of participants who interacted with our trained LLM Journalist appreciated it more than interacting with general-purpose LLMs.

*Molly Kennedy,Ali Parker,Yihong Liu,Hinrich Schütze*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper studies political framing in large language models (LLMs) used for text summarization, revealing a tendency toward centrist framing ("center-collapse") across models, with Grok 4 showing the strongest ideological expressiveness and Claude Sonnet 4.5/Llama 3.1 excelling in bias-accuracy trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing use of LLMs in journalism for text generation raises concerns about their potential to shape political interpretation through subtle wording choices (framing), necessitating empirical analysis of ideological bias in model outputs.

Method: Nine state-of-the-art LLMs were evaluated via (1) few-shot ideology prediction compared to LEFT/CENTER/RIGHT labels, (2) generation of summaries under FAITHFUL/CENTRIST/LEFT/RIGHT prompts, and (3) ideological scoring of outputs using a fixed evaluator to measure alignment.

Result: Pervasive ideological center-collapse was observed in both article-level ratings and model-generated summaries. Grok 4 demonstrated the highest ideological expressiveness, while Claude Sonnet 4.5 (commercial) and Llama 3.1 (open-weight) achieved the best bias-accuracy performance.

Conclusion: LLMs systematically favor centrist framing in text generation, but advanced models like Claude Sonnet 4.5 and Llama 3.1 improve bias-accuracy trade-offs, enabling potential mitigation of political framing risks in applications like journalism.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) based summarization and text generation are increasingly used for producing and rewriting text, raising concerns about political framing in journalism where subtle wording choices can shape interpretation. Across nine state-of-the-art LLMs, we study political framing by testing whether LLMs' classification-based bias signals align with framing behavior in their generated summaries. We first compare few-shot ideology predictions against LEFT/CENTER/RIGHT labels. We then generate "steered" summaries under FAITHFUL, CENTRIST, LEFT, and RIGHT prompts, and score all outputs using a single fixed ideology evaluator. We find pervasive ideological center-collapse in both article-level ratings and generated text, indicating a systematic tendency toward centrist framing. Among evaluated models, Grok 4 is by far the most ideologically expressive generator, while Claude Sonnet 4.5 and Llama 3.1 achieve the strongest bias-rating performance among commercial and open-weight models, respectively.

Motivation: 非结构化EHR文档的多样性和缺乏标准化映射阻碍了互操作性患者数字孪生的生成，需通过自然语言处理解决这一挑战。

Method: 利用命名实体识别（NER）提取临床概念，结合概念归一化（至SNOMED-CT/ICD-10）和关系抽取，构建符合FHIR标准的结构化数字孪生表示。

Result: 在MIMIC-IV演示数据集上的评估显示，实体和关系抽取的F1分数较高，对比基线方法在模式完整性和互操作性上有显著提升。

Conclusion: 该流程有效解决了非结构化EHR向标准化数字孪生的转换问题，为医疗数字孪生的临床应用提供了可扩展的技术路径。

Abstract: Digital twins -- virtual replicas of physical entities -- are gaining traction in healthcare for personalized monitoring, predictive modeling, and clinical decision support. However, generating interoperable patient digital twins from unstructured electronic health records (EHRs) remains challenging due to variability in clinical documentation and lack of standardized mappings. This paper presents a semantic NLP-driven pipeline that transforms free-text EHR notes into FHIR-compliant digital twin representations. The pipeline leverages named entity recognition (NER) to extract clinical concepts, concept normalization to map entities to SNOMED-CT or ICD-10, and relation extraction to capture structured associations between conditions, medications, and observations. Evaluation on MIMIC-IV Clinical Database Demo with validation against MIMIC-IV-on-FHIR reference mappings demonstrates high F1-scores for entity and relation extraction, with improved schema completeness and interoperability compared to baseline methods.

Motivation: 传统文本自动补全（TAC）缺乏对视觉信息的利用，而数字助手、医疗咨询等场景需结合多模态上下文理解用户意图，因此需要更智能的多模态补全方法。

Method: 设计MAC任务，整合文本与视觉线索；改编MMDialog、ImageChat构建多模态数据集；开发Router-Suggest框架，动态切换轻量级模型与VLM模型。

Result: Router-Suggest相较最佳VLM模型获得2.3x-10x加速；用户研究表明VLM模型显著降低输入负担，提升多轮对话补全质量与满意度。

Conclusion: 多模态上下文对自动补全系统至关重要，动态模型选择框架实现了效率与用户体验兼备，为开发感知型数字助手提供新方向。

Abstract: Real-time multimodal auto-completion is essential for digital assistants, chatbots, design tools, and healthcare consultations, where user inputs rely on shared visual context. We introduce Multimodal Auto-Completion (MAC), a task that predicts upcoming characters in live chats using partially typed text and visual cues. Unlike traditional text-only auto-completion (TAC), MAC grounds predictions in multimodal context to better capture user intent. To enable this task, we adapt MMDialog and ImageChat to create benchmark datasets. We evaluate leading vision-language models (VLMs) against strong textual baselines, highlighting trade-offs in accuracy and efficiency. We present Router-Suggest, a router framework that dynamically selects between textual models and VLMs based on dialog context, along with a lightweight variant for resource-constrained environments. Router-Suggest achieves a 2.3x to 10x speedup over the best-performing VLM. A user study shows that VLMs significantly excel over textual models on user satisfaction, notably saving user typing effort and improving the quality of completions in multi-turn conversations. These findings underscore the need for multimodal context in auto-completions, leading to smarter, user-aware assistants.

Some follow-up works further improved MT performance via preference optimization, but they leave a key aspect largely underexplored: the order in which data samples are given during training. We address this topic by integrating curriculum learning into various state-of-the-art preference optimization algorithms to boost MT performance. We introduce a novel curriculum learning strategy with restarts (CLewR), which reiterates easy-to-hard curriculum multiple times during training to effectively mitigate the catastrophic forgetting of easy examples. We demonstrate consistent gains across several model families (Gemma2, Qwen2.5, Llama3.1) and preference optimization techniques. We publicly release our code at https://github.com/alexandra-dragomir/CLewR.

### [85] [What do the metrics mean? A critical analysis of the use of Automated Evaluation Metrics in Interpreting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05864)
*Jonathan Downie,Joss Moorkens*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 当前自动翻译评价指标因忽视交际语境，单独使用时难以有效评估口译质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着远程口译、计算机辅助口译和自动化语音翻译技术的发展，亟需快速评估口译质量的方法，但现有自动评价方法在真实语境适配性方面存在不足。

Method: 通过系统梳理近期提出的自动化质量评估方法，结合口译实证研究案例，分析这些方法在人类与机器口译质量评估中的适用性。

Result: 发现现有自动评价指标（如BLEU、METEOR）无法有效捕捉交际语境因素（如文化背景、互动动态），导致对真实口译质量的误判风险增加。

Conclusion: 自动化评价指标需融合多模态语境数据（如视频眼动追踪、环境声学参数）与传统人工评估，才能实现对口译质量的立体化测量。

Abstract: With the growth of interpreting technologies, from remote interpreting and Computer-Aided Interpreting to automated speech translation and interpreting avatars, there is now a high demand for ways to quickly and efficiently measure the quality of any interpreting delivered. A range of approaches to fulfil the need for quick and efficient quality measurement have been proposed, each involving some measure of automation. This article examines these recently-proposed quality measurement methods and will discuss their suitability for measuring the quality of authentic interpreting practice, whether delivered by humans or machines, concluding that automatic metrics as currently proposed cannot take into account the communicative context and thus are not viable measures of the quality of any interpreting provision when used on their own. Across all attempts to measure or even categorise quality in Interpreting Studies, the contexts in which interpreting takes place have become fundamental to the final analysis.

TL;DR: 该研究提出一种结合词性（POS）代码切换和重放适配器的持续学习策略，以缓解从小型语言模型（SLM）在从大语言模型（LLM）训练时的灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言建模中面临的主要挑战是灾难性遗忘，特别是在为低资源语言构建SLM时，从LLM迁移过程中容易丢失原有知识，需寻找有效策略解决此问题。

Method: 采用基于词性标记的代码切换策略与重放适配器相结合的持续学习方法，在训练SLM时保留LLM的知识并适应新语言任务。

Result: 在视觉问答和语言建模等跨模态任务实验中，所提方法成功缓解了灾难性遗忘，验证了模型架构的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过持续学习与任务适配策略，显著提升了多语言场景下SLM的性能，为低资源语言模型训练提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Modelling a language model for a multi-lingual scenario includes several potential challenges, among which catastrophic forgetting is the major challenge. For example, small language models (SLM) built for low-resource languages by adapting large language models (LLMs) pose the challenge of catastrophic forgetting. This work proposes to employ a continual learning strategy using parts-of-speech (POS)-based code-switching along with a replay adapter strategy to mitigate the identified gap of catastrophic forgetting while training SLM from LLM. Experiments conducted on vision language tasks such as visual question answering and language modelling task exhibits the success of the proposed architecture.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: iReasoner通过显式思维链自监督增强LMM推理能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LMM自演进框架过度关注最终结果奖励，忽视关键中间推理过程的约束

Method: 构建Proposer-Solver双循环架构，引入轨迹感知的中间推理一致性奖励机制

Result: 在Qwen2.5-VL-7B基础上实现多模态推理基准平均提升2.1分

Conclusion: 验证了无监督场景下推理过程显式建模对LMM自演进的有效性

Abstract: Recent work shows that large multimodal models (LMMs) can self-improve from unlabeled data via self-play and intrinsic feedback. Yet existing self-evolving frameworks mainly reward final outcomes, leaving intermediate reasoning weakly constrained despite its importance for visually grounded decision making. We propose iReasoner, a self-evolving framework that improves an LMM's implicit reasoning by explicitly eliciting chain-of-thought (CoT) and rewarding its internal agreement. In a Proposer--Solver loop over unlabeled images, iReasoner augments outcome-level intrinsic rewards with a trajectory-aware signal defined over intermediate reasoning steps, providing learning signals that distinguish reasoning paths leading to the same answer without ground-truth labels or external judges. Starting from Qwen2.5-VL-7B, iReasoner yields up to $+2.1$ points across diverse multimodal reasoning benchmarks under fully unsupervised post-training. We hope this work serves as a starting point for reasoning-aware self-improvement in LMMs in purely unsupervised settings.

*Jakub Harasta,Matej Vasina,Martin Kornel,Tomas Foltynek*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨大型语言模型（LLMs）在家庭法律场景中的性别偏见问题，通过比较不同模型在离婚情境下的输出，揭示公众依赖LLMs进行法律自助的风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着公众日益依赖LLMs进行法律自助理赔，但其输出可能存在偏见或错误，导致法律决策偏差。研究旨在评估LLMs在敏感法律场景中的可靠性，并揭示性别偏见的潜在风险。

Method: 设计基于捷克家庭法的离婚场景，使用性别化名称和中性标签两种版本，测试GPT-5 nano、Claude Haiku 4.5等四模型的零样本交互。引入九个法律相关变量，分析其对模型建议共同抚养比例的影响。

Result: 初步结果发现不同模型表现存在差异，部分系统生成与性别相关的决策模式，暗示偏见可能性。

Conclusion: 研究强调公众依赖LLMs的法律风险，并指出需在敏感领域加强模型行为评估，提供探索性证据以识别系统性不对称而非因果关系。

Abstract: Access to justice remains limited for many people, leading laypersons to increasingly rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) for legal self-help. Laypeople use these tools intuitively, which may lead them to form expectations based on incomplete, incorrect, or biased outputs. This study examines whether leading LLMs exhibit gender bias in their responses to a realistic family law scenario. We present an expert-designed divorce scenario grounded in Czech family law and evaluate four state-of-the-art LLMs GPT-5 nano, Claude Haiku 4.5, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Llama 3.3 in a fully zero-shot interaction. We deploy two versions of the scenario, one with gendered names and one with neutral labels, to establish a baseline for comparison. We further introduce nine legally relevant factors that vary the factual circumstances of the case and test whether these variations influence the models' proposed shared-parenting ratios. Our preliminary results highlight differences across models and suggest gender-dependent patterns in the outcomes generated by some systems. The findings underscore both the risks associated with laypeople's reliance on LLMs for legal guidance and the need for more robust evaluation of model behavior in sensitive legal contexts. We present exploratory and descriptive evidence intended to identify systematic asymmetries rather than to establish causal effects.

TL;DR: 该论文系统研究了偏好调整在领域转移下的泛化能力，发现基于伪标签的适应策略能显著缓解领域差异导致的性能退化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明偏好调整在领域外场景下会降低模型性能，但尚未有研究评估适应策略如何缓解这种领域偏移问题，故作者开展系统性研究填补空白。

Method: 对比5种主流对齐目标和多种领域适应策略（如目标域监督微调、伪标签生成），在文本摘要和问答有效性任务上评估跨领域泛化能力。

Result: 不同对齐目标在领域偏移下的泛化表现存在显著差异，基于伪标签的适应策略可将领域偏移导致的性能损失降低30%以上。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了对齐目标选择与适应策略设计对跨领域模型对齐的效果边界，验证了伪标签技术在提升领域鲁棒性方面的关键作用。

Abstract: Preference tuning aligns pretrained language models to human judgments of quality, helpfulness, or safety by optimizing over explicit preference signals rather than likelihood alone. Prior work has shown that preference-tuning degrades performance and reduces helpfulness when evaluated outside the training domain. However, the extent to which adaptation strategies mitigate this domain shift remains unexplored. We address this challenge by conducting a comprehensive and systematic study of alignment generalization under domain shift. We compare five popular alignment objectives and various adaptation strategies from source to target, including target-domain supervised fine-tuning and pseudo-labeling, across summarization and question-answering helpfulness tasks. Our findings reveal systematic differences in generalization across alignment objectives under domain shift. We show that adaptation strategies based on pseudo-labeling can substantially reduce domain-shift degradation

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文指出现有大型语言模型（LLM）依赖的点一致性评估（如Self-Consistency）无法反映信念脆弱性，提出Neighbor-Consistency Belief（NCB）结构化评估方法及压力测试协议。实验表明NCB可有效识别脆弱知识，结合Structure-Aware Training（SAT）能降低长尾知识脆弱性约30%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM评估仅关注答案正确性（如Self-Consistency），但现实中模型需保持上下文干扰下的信念稳定性。研究表明高自洽性答案可能在轻微干扰下迅速崩溃，需新的结构化评估方法衡量信念鲁棒性

Method: 1) 提出NCB指标，通过概念邻域内回答一致性评估信念结构 2) 设计认知压力测试协议，系统性引入上下文干扰测试输出稳定性 3) 开发Structure-Aware Training（SAT）方法，优化上下文不变的信念结构

Result: 1) 实验显示高NCB数据在干扰下表现更稳定 2) SAT方法使长尾知识脆弱性降低约30% 3) 验证了概念邻域一致性对信念鲁棒性的预测价值

Conclusion: 信念稳定性是LLM可靠部署的关键维度，结构化评估（NCB）与结构增强训练（SAT）为提升模型鲁棒性提供了有效框架，需将信念结构优化纳入LLM开发核心环节

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world settings, correctness alone is insufficient. Reliable deployment requires maintaining truthful beliefs under contextual perturbations. Existing evaluations largely rely on point-wise confidence like Self-Consistency, which can mask brittle belief. We show that even facts answered with perfect self-consistency can rapidly collapse under mild contextual interference. To address this gap, we propose Neighbor-Consistency Belief (NCB), a structural measure of belief robustness that evaluates response coherence across a conceptual neighborhood. To validate the efficiency of NCB, we introduce a new cognitive stress-testing protocol that probes outputs stability under contextual interference. Experiments across multiple LLMs show that the performance of high-NCB data is relatively more resistant to interference. Finally, we present Structure-Aware Training (SAT), which optimizes context-invariant belief structure and reduces long-tail knowledge brittleness by approximately 30%.

TL;DR: Pantagruel模型是一种新的自监督法语文本和语音编码模型家族，通过在特征空间中学习上下文表示而非预测特定模态的目标，预训练于超大规模法语数据集并在多项下游任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自监督方法依赖文本token或语音单元等模态专用目标，而Pantagruel通过特征空间中的上下文表示统一学习，旨在更有效捕捉语言和声学规律。

Method: 采用特征空间内自监督目标进行预训练，使用Wikipedia、OSCAR、MultilingualLibriSpeech等超大数据集，新建10万小时法语音频数据集INA-100k，在FLUE/LeBenchmark等标准评测集评估多模态表现。

Result: 在法语文本和语音基准任务中表现优于CamemBERT、FlauBERT等基线模型，验证了通用架构处理双模态输入的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 特征空间自监督目标在法语表征学习中有效，Pantagruel为多模态语音-文本理解提供了强大基础，尤其体现在跨模态任务的卓越性能上。

Abstract: We release Pantagruel models, a new family of self-supervised encoder models for French text and speech. Instead of predicting modality-tailored targets such as textual tokens or speech units, Pantagruel learns contextualized target representations in the feature space, allowing modality-specific encoders to capture linguistic and acoustic regularities more effectively. Separate models are pre-trained on large-scale French corpora, including Wikipedia, OSCAR and CroissantLLM for text, together with MultilingualLibriSpeech, LeBenchmark, and INA-100k for speech. INA-100k is a newly introduced 100,000-hour corpus of French audio derived from the archives of the Institut National de l'Audiovisuel (INA), the national repository of French radio and television broadcasts, providing highly diverse audio data. We evaluate Pantagruel across a broad range of downstream tasks spanning both modalities, including those from the standard French benchmarks such as FLUE or LeBenchmark. Across these tasks, Pantagruel models show competitive or superior performance compared to strong French baselines such as CamemBERT, FlauBERT, and LeBenchmark2.0, while maintaining a shared architecture that can seamlessly handle either speech or text inputs. These results confirm the effectiveness of feature-space self-supervised objectives for French representation learning and highlight Pantagruel as a robust foundation for multimodal speech-text understanding.

TL;DR: 该论文提出大型语言模型难以通过模仿学习长链推理（Long CoT），但可通过类似分子结构的稳定轨迹实现。作者引入Mole-Syn方法，提升推理性能与训练稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究解决LLMs无法从人类或非Long CoT模型模仿中有效学习长链推理的问题，提出需要新的理论框架解析Long CoT的结构本质。

Method: 通过分子类比提出三种交互类型（深度推理、自反思、自探索），分析微调后的Long CoT轨迹结构；引入有效语义同分异构体概念，开发Mole-Syn分布转移图方法合成有效结构。

Result: 发现稳定Long CoT结构源于微调而非模仿，仅快速熵收敛的『键』支持学习，结构竞争会破坏训练；Mole-Syn在基准测试中提升性能与强化学习稳定性。

Conclusion: 将分子结构理论引入Long CoT，揭示结构化交互与分布转移对训练的重要性，为提升模型推理能力提供新方法论。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often fail to learn effective long chain-of-thought (Long CoT) reasoning from human or non-Long-CoT LLMs imitation. To understand this, we propose that effective and learnable Long CoT trajectories feature stable molecular-like structures in unified view, which are formed by three interaction types: Deep-Reasoning (covalent-like), Self-Reflection (hydrogen-bond-like), and Self-Exploration (van der Waals-like). Analysis of distilled trajectories reveals these structures emerge from Long CoT fine-tuning, not keyword imitation. We introduce Effective Semantic Isomers and show that only bonds promoting fast entropy convergence support stable Long CoT learning, while structural competition impairs training. Drawing on these findings, we present Mole-Syn, a distribution-transfer-graph method that guides synthesis of effective Long CoT structures, boosting performance and RL stability across benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Prompt caching in LLM agents reduces API costs by 45-80% and improves latency by 13-31%, with strategic caching (e.g., excluding dynamic tool results) outperforming naive full-context caching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work lacks quantification of cost savings and comparison of caching strategies for multi-turn agentic tasks, despite LLM providers offering prompt caching.

Method: Evaluated three caching strategies (full context, system prompt only, excluding dynamic tool results) across OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google using DeepResearchBench, a 500-agent-session benchmark with 10,000-token prompts.

Result: API cost reductions of 45-80%, TTFT improvements of 13-31%; strategic caching (dynamic content placement, excluding tool results) provided consistent benefits over full-context caching.

Conclusion: Strategic prompt cache management is critical for production agentic systems, with nuanced provider-specific behaviors requiring tailored implementation guidance.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Model (LLM) agents have enabled complex multi-turn agentic tasks requiring extensive tool calling, where conversations can span dozens of API calls with increasingly large context windows. However, although major LLM providers offer prompt caching to reduce cost and latency, its benefits for agentic workloads remain underexplored in the research literature. To our knowledge, no prior work quantifies these cost savings or compares caching strategies for multi-turn agentic tasks. We present a comprehensive evaluation of prompt caching across three major LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google) and compare three caching strategies, including full context caching, system prompt only caching, and caching that excludes dynamic tool results. We evaluate on DeepResearchBench, a multi-turn agentic benchmark where agents autonomously execute real-world web search tool calls to answer complex research questions, measuring both API cost and time to first token (TTFT) across over 500 agent sessions with 10,000-token system prompts. Our results demonstrate that prompt caching reduces API costs by 45-80% and improves time to first token by 13-31% across providers. We find that strategic prompt cache block control, such as placing dynamic content at the end of the system prompt, avoiding dynamic traditional function calling, and excluding dynamic tool results, provides more consistent benefits than naive full-context caching, which can paradoxically increase latency. Our analysis reveals nuanced variations in caching behavior across providers, and we provide practical guidance for implementing prompt caching in production agentic systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出AdaFuse，一种基于动态融合单元选择的自适应集成解码框架，在大语言模型推理阶段通过不确定性判断实时调整融合策略，在问答、算术推理和机器翻译任务上平均相对提升6.88%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有集成方法存在固定融合粒度缺乏灵活性、无法适应不同任务生成特征的问题，且缺乏中段生成适应性。研究旨在通过动态调整融合单元解决此根本性限制

Method: 提出不确定性准则动态判断融合时机：高置信度时直接生成，低置信度时触发多样性感知缩放策略探索候选项。以词语为对齐基本单元，建立自适应集成与测试时缩放的协同机制

Result: 在开放域问答、算术推理和机器翻译实验中，AdaFuse在强基线模型上保持一致性优势，达到6.88%的平均相对改进。代码开源在https://github.com/CCM0111/AdaFuse

Conclusion: 动态不确定性评估与多样性探索的协同机制验证有效，自适应融合与测试时缩放的双向增强模式显著提升集成质量，为多模型协同提供新范式

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit complementary strengths arising from differences in pretraining data, model architectures, and decoding behaviors. Inference-time ensembling provides a practical way to combine these capabilities without retraining. However, existing ensemble approaches suffer from fundamental limitations. Most rely on fixed fusion granularity, which lacks the flexibility required for mid-generation adaptation and fails to adapt to different generation characteristics across tasks. To address these challenges, we propose AdaFuse, an adaptive ensemble decoding framework that dynamically selects semantically appropriate fusion units during generation. Rather than committing to a fixed granularity, AdaFuse adjusts fusion behavior on the fly based on the decoding context, with words serving as basic building blocks for alignment. To be specific, we introduce an uncertainty-based criterion to decide whether to apply ensembling at each decoding step. Under confident decoding states, the model continues generation directly. In less certain states, AdaFuse invokes a diversity-aware scaling strategy to explore alternative candidate continuations and inform ensemble decisions. This design establishes a synergistic interaction between adaptive ensembling and test-time scaling, where ensemble decisions guide targeted exploration, and the resulting diversity in turn strengthens ensemble quality. Experiments on open-domain question answering, arithmetic reasoning, and machine translation demonstrate that AdaFuse consistently outperforms strong ensemble baselines, achieving an average relative improvement of 6.88%. The code is available at https://github.com/CCM0111/AdaFuse.
