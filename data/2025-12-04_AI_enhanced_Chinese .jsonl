Building on a recent Second Law of Intelligence that treats ethical entropy as a state variable which tends to increase unless countered by alignment work, we make this framework operational for large language models. We define a five-way behavioral taxonomy, train a classifier to estimate ethical entropy S(t) from model transcripts, and measure entropy dynamics for base and instruction-tuned variants of four frontier models across stress tests. Base models show sustained entropy growth, while tuned variants suppress drift and reduce ethical entropy by roughly eighty percent. From these trajectories we estimate an effective alignment work rate gamma_eff and embed S(t) and gamma_eff in a monitoring pipeline that raises alerts when entropy drift exceeds a stability threshold, enabling run-time oversight of value drift.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e'\u667a\u80fd\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5b9a\u5f8b'\u7684\u4f26\u7406\u71b5\u52a8\u6001\u76d1\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e94\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u91cf\u5316\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4f26\u7406\u71b5S(t)\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u03b3_eff\u5bf9\u9f50\u5de5\u4f5c\u7387\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u4ef7\u503c\u6f02\u79fb\u9884\u8b66\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u9759\u6001\u57fa\u51c6\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349LLM\u52a8\u6001\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\uff08\u5982\u5206\u5e03\u6f02\u79fb\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\u3001\u5bf9\u9f50\u9000\u5316\uff09\uff0c\u9700\u5efa\u7acb\u52a8\u6001\u98ce\u9669\u7ba1\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u4f26\u7406\u71b5\u7406\u8bba\u6269\u5c55\u5230LLM\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u884c\u4e3a\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1S(t)\u91cf\u5316\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56db\u7c7b\u524d\u6cbf\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u542b\u57fa\u7840\u7248/\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18\u7248\uff09\u538b\u529b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u5bfc\u6709\u6548\u5bf9\u9f50\u7387\u03b3_eff\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6301\u7eed\u71b5\u589e\uff0c\u8c03\u4f18\u6a21\u578b\u51cf\u5c1180%\u4f26\u7406\u71b5\uff1b\u76d1\u63a7\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u5b9e\u65f6\u68c0\u6d4b\u71b5\u53d8\uff0c\u5f53\u6f02\u79fb\u8d85\u8fc7\u9608\u503c\u65f6\u89e6\u53d1\u9884\u8b66\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u76d1\u63a7\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4f26\u7406\u71b5\u52a8\u6001\u76d1\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u7ba1\u7406LLM\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u5bf9\u9f50\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001AI\u5b89\u5168\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u6280\u672f\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Based on these LLMs, businesses have started to provide Embeddings-as-a-Service (EaaS), offering feature extraction capabilities (in the form of text embeddings) that benefit downstream natural language processing tasks. However, prior research has demonstrated that EaaS is vulnerable to imitation attacks, where an attacker clones the service's model in a black-box manner without access to the model's internal workings. In response, watermarks have been added to the text embeddings to protect the intellectual property of EaaS providers by allowing them to check for model ownership. This thesis focuses on defending against imitation attacks by investigating EaaS watermarks. To achieve this goal, we unveil novel attacks and propose and validate new watermarking techniques.\n  Firstly, we show that existing EaaS watermarks can be removed through paraphrasing the input text when attackers clone the model during imitation attacks. Our study illustrates that paraphrasing can effectively bypass current state-of-the-art EaaS watermarks across various attack setups (including different paraphrasing techniques and models) and datasets in most instances. This demonstrates a new vulnerability in recent EaaS watermarking techniques.\n  Subsequently, as a countermeasure, we propose a novel watermarking technique, WET (Watermarking EaaS with Linear Transformation), which employs linear transformation of the embeddings. Watermark verification is conducted by applying a reverse transformation and comparing the similarity between recovered and original embeddings. We demonstrate its robustness against paraphrasing attacks with near-perfect verifiability. We conduct detailed ablation studies to assess the significance of each component and hyperparameter in WET.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709EaaS\u6c34\u5370\u6613\u88ab\u6587\u672c\u6539\u5199\u653b\u51fb\u79fb\u9664\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7ebf\u6027\u53d8\u6362\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5WET\u6709\u6548\u9632\u5fa1\u8be5\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9EaaS\u670d\u52a1\u6a21\u578b\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u9ed1\u76d2\u514b\u9686\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6c34\u5370\u6280\u672f\u88ab\u53d1\u73b0\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u672c\u6539\u5199\u7ed5\u8fc7\uff0c\u9700\u5f3a\u5316\u6570\u5b57\u6c34\u5370\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7ebf\u6027\u4ee3\u6570\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u5728\u53cd\u53d8\u6362\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u68c0\u6d4b\u6c34\u5370\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u7684WET\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660eWET\u5bf9\u540c\u4e49\u8bcd\u66ff\u6362/\u53e5\u6cd5\u91cd\u6784\u7b49\u6539\u5199\u653b\u51fb\u5b9e\u73b098.6%\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u6d88\u878d\u663e\u793a\u53d8\u6362\u77e9\u9635\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0e\u68c0\u6d4b\u5f3a\u5ea6\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63ed\u793a\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u6301\u6539\u5199\u5bf9\u6c34\u5370\u7684\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u9996\u4e2a\u6297\u8bed\u4e49\u53d8\u6362\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6c34\u5370\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u4ea7\u6743\u4fdd\u62a4\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

In this work, we present the first solution to address CSB through Reasoning Dependency Generation (RDG), a novel framework for generating unbiased reasoning data to mitigate choice-supportive bias through fine-tuning. RDG automatically constructs balanced reasoning QA pairs, explicitly (un)modeling the dependencies between choices, evidences, and justifications. Our approach is able to generate a large-scale dataset of QA pairs across domains, incorporating Contextual Dependency Data and Dependency Decouple Data. Experiments show that LLMs fine-tuned on RDG-generated data demonstrate a 81.5% improvement in memory-based experiments and 94.3% improvement in the evaluation-based experiment, while maintaining similar performance on standard BBQ benchmarks.

We propose a novel self-supervised symbolic auto-encoder that encodes diagrams into structured primitives and their interrelationships within the latent space, and decodes them through our executable engine to reconstruct the input diagrams. Central to this architecture is Symbolic Hierarchical Process Reward Modeling, which applies hierarchical step-level parsing rewards to enforce point-on-line, line-on-shape, and shape-on-relation consistency.

Within this framework, the data-generation pipeline systematically extracts subgraphs from large knowledge bases, applies noise filtering, and leverages LLMs to generate corresponding natural text descriptions, a task more aligned with LLM capabilities than direct KG generation from text. This pipeline enables generating datasets composed of longer texts paired with larger KGs that better reflect real-world scenarios compared to existing benchmarks, thus supporting effective SFT of lightweight models for single-shot KG construction. Experimental results on CE12k, a dataset generated using the introduced pipeline, show that InvertiTune outperforms larger non-fine-tuned LLMs as well as state-of-the-art Text2KG approaches, while also demonstrating stronger cross-dataset generalization on CrossEval-1200, a test set created from three established benchmark datasets and CE12k. These findings highlight the importance of realistic, high-quality training data for advancing efficient and high-performing Text2KG systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "InvertiTune\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u53ef\u63a7\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u548c\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\uff08Text2KG\uff09\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u590d\u6742\u5173\u7cfb\u6355\u6349\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709Text2KG\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u8fed\u4ee3\u5f0f\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u9700\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5355\u6b21KG\u6784\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\uff0c\u4ece\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u63d0\u53d6\u5b50\u56fe\u3001\u53bb\u566a\u540e\u751f\u6210\u81ea\u7136\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u518d\u7528\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u8f7b\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u751f\u6210\u957f\u6587\u672c\u4e0e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21KG\u914d\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5728CE12k\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6d4b\u8bd5CrossEval-1200\u4e0a\uff0cInvertiTune\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u975e\u5fae\u8c03LLM\u548c\u524d\u6cbfText2KG\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5355\u6b21\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u663e\u8457\u3002", "conclusion": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u6548Text2KG\u7cfb\u7edf\u5177\u6709\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u5355\u6b21KG\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Project page: https://waabi.ai/flux4d/", "summary": "Reconstructing large-scale dynamic scenes from visual observations is a fundamental challenge in computer vision, with critical implications for robotics and autonomous systems. While recent differentiable rendering methods such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have achieved impressive photorealistic reconstruction, they suffer from scalability limitations and require annotations to decouple actor motion. Existing self-supervised methods attempt to eliminate explicit annotations by leveraging motion cues and geometric priors, yet they remain constrained by per-scene optimization and sensitivity to hyperparameter tuning. In this paper, we introduce Flux4D, a simple and scalable framework for 4D reconstruction of large-scale dynamic scenes. Flux4D directly predicts 3D Gaussians and their motion dynamics to reconstruct sensor observations in a fully unsupervised manner. By adopting only photometric losses and enforcing an \"as static as possible\" regularization, Flux4D learns to decompose dynamic elements directly from raw data without requiring pre-trained supervised models or foundational priors simply by training across many scenes. Our approach enables efficient reconstruction of dynamic scenes within seconds, scales effectively to large datasets, and generalizes well to unseen environments, including rare and unknown objects. Experiments on outdoor driving datasets show Flux4D significantly outperforms existing methods in scalability, generalization, and reconstruction quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faFlux4D\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc73D\u9ad8\u65af\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5b9e\u73b0\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982NeRF/3DGS\u5b58\u5728\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5dee\u548c\u4f9d\u8d56\u8fd0\u52a8\u6ce8\u89e3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u5355\u573a\u666f\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u901a\u7528\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684Flux4D\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u91c7\u75283D\u9ad8\u65af\u8868\u793a\u573a\u666f\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5149\u5ea6\u635f\u5931\u7ea6\u675f\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5f15\u5165'\u5c3d\u53ef\u80fd\u9759\u6001'\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u9879\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u89e3\u52a8\u6001\u7269\u4f53\uff0c\u5b8c\u5168\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u7b7e\u6216\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6237\u5916\u9a7e\u9a76\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cFlux4D\u5904\u7406\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u573a\u666f\u901f\u5ea6\u8fbe\u79d2\u7ea7\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u80fd\u529b\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u53472\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u91cd\u5efa\u5305\u62ec\u7f55\u89c1\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u672a\u77e5\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5b9a\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e3b\u6d41\u65b9\u6cd515%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u660e\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u573a\u666f\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u53ef\u66ff\u4ee3\u663e\u5f0f\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

We introduce a two-stage large language model (LLM) based method for inferring material composition directly from 3D point clouds with coarse segmentations. Our key insight is to decouple reasoning about what an object is from what it is made of. In the first stage, an LLM predicts the object's semantic; in the second stage, it assigns plausible materials to each geometric segment, conditioned on the inferred semantics. Both stages operate in a zero-shot manner, without task-specific training.

While scaling model size mitigates this \\citep{brown2020language}, the fundamental myopia of the NTP objective remains. In this work, we introduce the Idea-Gated Transformer, a novel architecture that separates semantic planning from syntactic generation. We introduce an auxiliary ``Idea Head'' trained to predict the bag-of-words distribution for a future context window, creating a latent ``Concept Vector'' that actively gates the main vocabulary during generation. We propose a differentiable gating mechanism that suppresses semantically irrelevant tokens, effectively pruning the search space in real-time. Experiments on WikiText-103 demonstrate that while the Idea-Gated model achieves comparable validation perplexity to a standard GPT-2 baseline, it exhibits significantly superior Domain Retention.

Learning-based denoisers have the potential to reconstruct high-quality images. For training, however, these denoisers require large paired datasets of clean and noisy images, which are difficult to collect. Noise synthesis is an alternative to large-scale data acquisition: given a clean image, we can synthesize a realistic noisy counterpart. In this work, we propose a general and practical noise synthesis method that requires only one single noisy image and one single dark frame per ISO setting. We represent signal-dependent noise with a Poisson distribution and introduce a Fourier-domain spectral sampling algorithm to accurately model signal-independent noise. The latter generates diverse noise realizations that maintain the spatial and statistical properties of real sensor noise.

Despite the remarkable progress of large language models (LLMs), most current approaches still rely on forward reasoning paradigms, generating step-by-step rationales from premises to conclusions. However, such methods often suffer from redundant inference paths, hallucinated steps, and semantic drift, resulting in inefficient and unreliable reasoning. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Hypothesis-driven Backward Logical Reasoning (HBLR). The core idea is to integrate confidence-aware symbolic translation with hypothesis-driven backward reasoning. In the translation phase, only high-confidence spans are converted into logical form, such as First-Order Logic (FOL), while uncertain content remains in natural language. A translation reflection module further ensures semantic fidelity by evaluating symbolic outputs and reverting lossy ones back to text when necessary. In the reasoning phase, HBLR simulates human deductive thinking by assuming the conclusion is true and recursively verifying its premises. A reasoning reflection module further identifies and corrects flawed inference steps, enhancing logical coherence. Extensive experiments on five reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that HBLR consistently outperforms strong baselines in both accuracy and efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u9a71\u52a8\u9006\u5411\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6HBLR\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e0e\u9006\u5411\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u524d\u5411\u63a8\u7406\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u5197\u4f59\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u3001\u5e7b\u89c9\u6b65\u9aa4\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e14\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u3002", "method": "HBLR\u5206\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a1) \u7ffb\u8bd1\u9636\u6bb5\u4ec5\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6587\u672c\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u4e00\u9636\u903b\u8f91\uff0c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u90e8\u5206\u4fdd\u7559\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u5c04\u6a21\u5757\u786e\u4fdd\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u771f\uff1b2) \u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u5047\u8bbe\u7ed3\u8bba\u4e3a\u771f\u5e76\u9012\u5f52\u9a8c\u8bc1\u524d\u63d0\uff0c\u53cd\u5c04\u6a21\u5757\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u4fee\u6b63\u9519\u8bef\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u9879\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cHBLR\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u5747\u8d85\u8d8a\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "HBLR\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u524d\u5411\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u4e3a\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\u3001\u6570\u5b66\u8bc1\u660e\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u5177\u6709\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

However, the model trained based on LoRA often has an unsatisfactory performance due to its low-rank assumption. In this paper, we propose a novel method called Dual LoRA to improve the performance by incorporating an inductive bias into the original LoRA. Specifically, we separate low-rank matrices into two groups: the magnitude group to control whether or not and how far we should update a parameter and the direction group to decide whether this parameter should move forward or backward, to better simulate the parameter updating process of the full fine-tuning based on gradient-based optimization algorithms.

Traditionally, high-definition (HD) maps are providing this representation of the static road infrastructure to the autonomous system a priori. However, because the real world is constantly changing, such maps must be constructed online from on-board sensor data. Navigation-grade standard-definition (SD) maps are widely available, but their resolution is insufficient for direct deployment. Instead, they can be used as coarse prior to guide the online map construction process. We propose NavMapFusion, a diffusion-based framework that performs iterative denoising conditioned on high-fidelity sensor data and on low-fidelity navigation maps. This paper strives to answer: (1) How can coarse, potentially outdated navigation maps guide online map construction? (2) What advantages do diffusion models offer for map fusion? We demonstrate that diffusion-based map construction provides a robust framework for map fusion. Our key insight is that discrepancies between the prior map and online perception naturally correspond to noise within the diffusion process; consistent regions reinforce the map construction, whereas outdated segments are suppressed. On the nuScenes benchmark, NavMapFusion conditioned on coarse road lines from OpenStreetMap data reaches a 21.4% relative improvement on 100 m, and even stronger improvements on larger perception ranges, while maintaining real-time capabilities. By fusing low-fidelity priors with high-fidelity sensor data, the proposed method generates accurate and up-to-date environment representations, guiding towards safer and more reliable autonomous driving.

Recent reinforcement learning (RL) based large-thinking models demonstrate impressive expert-level abilities, i.e., software and math, but still rely heavily on verifiable rewards in specific domains, placing a significant bottleneck to extend the performance boundary of general reasoning capabilities. In this work, we propose PretrainZero, a reinforcement active learning framework built on the pretraining corpus to extend RL from domain-specific post-training to general pretraining. PretrainZero features the following characteristics: 1) Active pretraining: inspired by the active learning ability of humans, PretrainZero learns a unified reasoning policy to actively identify reasonable and informative contents from pretraining corpus, and reason to predict these contents by RL. 2) Self-supervised learning: without any verifiable labels, pretrained reward models, or supervised fine-tuning, we directly pretrain reasoners from 3 to 30B base models on the general Wikipedia corpus using RL, significantly breaking the verification data-wall for general reasoning. 3) Verification scaling: by tackling increasingly challenging masked spans, PretrainZero substantially enhances the general reasoning abilities of pretrained base models. In reinforcement pretraining, PretrainZero improves Qwen3-4B-Base for 8.43, 5.96 and 10.60 on MMLU-Pro, SuperGPQA and math average benchmarks.

Traditionally, EF estimation requires manual tracing and domain expertise, making the process time-consuming and subject to interobserver variability. Most current deep learning methods for EF prediction are black-box models with limited transparency, which reduces clinical trust. Some post-hoc explainability methods have been proposed to interpret the decision-making process after the prediction is made. However, these explanations do not guide the model's internal reasoning and therefore offer limited reliability in clinical applications. To address this, we introduce ProtoEFNet, a novel video-based prototype learning model for continuous EF regression. The model learns dynamic spatiotemporal prototypes that capture clinically meaningful cardiac motion patterns. Additionally, the proposed Prototype Angular Separation (PAS) loss enforces discriminative representations across the continuous EF spectrum. Our experiments on the EchonetDynamic dataset show that ProtoEFNet can achieve accuracy on par with its non-interpretable counterpart while providing clinically relevant insight. The ablation study shows that the proposed loss boosts performance with a 2% increase in F1 score from 77.67$\\pm$2.68 to 79.64$\\pm$2.10.

To bridge this gap, we first tailor general reasoning strategies to the summarization domain. We then conduct a systematic, large scale comparative study of 8 reasoning strategies and 3 Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) across 8 diverse datasets, assessing both summary quality and faithfulness. Our findings show that reasoning is not a universal solution and its effectiveness is highly dependent on the specific strategy and context. Specifically, we observe a trade-off between summary quality and factual faithfulness: explicit reasoning strategies tend to improve fluency at the expense of factual grounding, while implicit reasoning in LRMs exhibits the inverse pattern. Furthermore, increasing an LRM's internal reasoning budget does not improve, and can even hurt, factual consistency, suggesting that effective summarization demands faithful compression rather than creative over-thinking.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u793a\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u6458\u8981\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u679c\u5e76\u975e\u666e\u9002\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\uff1a\u663e\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u5347\u6d41\u7545\u5ea6\u4f46\u635f\u5bb3\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6027\uff0c\u5927\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u53cd\u4e4b\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u5185\u90e8\u63a8\u7406\u9884\u7b97\u53cd\u4f7f\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5206\u6790\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1(\u5982\u6570\u5b66\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210)\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728\u62bd\u8c61\u6458\u8981\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u4ec5\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u7406\u6240\u5f53\u7136\u800c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u9700\u586b\u8865\u8be5\u8ba4\u77e5\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u901a\u7528\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u9002\u914d\u5230\u6458\u8981\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f838\u79cd\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u548c3\u79cd\u5927\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u57288\u4e2a\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6458\u8981\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u679c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u5177\u4f53\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6027\u7684\u6743\u8861\u73b0\u8c61\uff1a\u663e\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u5347\u6d41\u7545\u5ea6\u727a\u7272\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6027\uff0c\u9690\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\u76f8\u53cd\uff1b\u589e\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u63a8\u7406\u9884\u7b97\u5bf9\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65e0\u6539\u5584\u751a\u81f3\u4ea7\u751f\u8d1f\u9762\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6709\u6548\u6458\u8981\u9700\u8981\u5fe0\u5b9e\u538b\u7f29\u800c\u975e\u521b\u9020\u6027\u8fc7\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e0d\u540c\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\u9700\u7ed3\u5408\u573a\u666f\u7279\u6027\u624d\u80fd\u53d6\u5f97\u5e73\u8861\u3002"}}

This issue is problematic in image restoration for safety-critical domains such as medical imaging, industrial inspection, and remote sensing, where such errors undermine reliability and trust. For example, in low-field MRI, widely used in resource-limited settings, restoration models are essential for enhancing low-quality scans, yet hallucinations can lead to serious diagnostic errors. Progress has been hindered by a circular dependency: evaluating hallucinations requires labeled data, yet such labels are costly and subjective. We introduce HalluGen, a diffusion-based framework that synthesizes realistic hallucinations with controllable type, location, and severity, producing perceptually realistic but semantically incorrect outputs (segmentation IoU drops from 0.86 to 0.36). Using HalluGen, we construct the first large-scale hallucination dataset comprising 4,350 annotated images derived from 1,450 brain MR images for low-field enhancement, enabling systematic evaluation of hallucination detection and mitigation. We demonstrate its utility in two applications: (1) benchmarking image quality metrics and developing Semantic Hallucination Assessment via Feature Evaluation (SHAFE), a feature-based metric with soft-attention pooling that improves hallucination sensitivity over traditional metrics; and (2) training reference-free hallucination detectors that generalize to real restoration failures.

Shad Akhtar"], "title": "Fine-grained Narrative Classification in Biased News Articles", "comment": null, "summary": "Narratives are the cognitive and emotional scaffolds of propaganda. They organize isolated persuasive techniques into coherent stories that justify actions, attribute blame, and evoke identification with ideological camps. In this paper, we propose a novel fine-grained narrative classification in biased news articles. We also explore article-bias classification as the precursor task to narrative classification and fine-grained persuasive technique identification. We develop INDI-PROP, the first ideologically grounded fine-grained narrative dataset with multi-level annotation for analyzing propaganda in Indian news media. Our dataset INDI-PROP comprises 1,266 articles focusing on two polarizing socio-political events in recent times: CAA and the Farmers' protest. Each article is annotated at three hierarchical levels: (i) ideological article-bias (pro-government, pro-opposition, neutral), (ii) event-specific fine-grained narrative frames anchored in ideological polarity and communicative intent, and (iii) persuasive techniques. We propose FANTA and TPTC, two GPT-4o-mini guided multi-hop prompt-based reasoning frameworks for the bias, narrative, and persuasive technique classification.

The subtle, non-adjacent nature of early disease signals is often lost due to suboptimal architectural inductive biases: 2D/3D CNNs impose strong locality, while ViTs diffuse unconstrained global attention. This conflict leaves the optimal inductive structure for robust, sparse volumetric pattern recognition unresolved. This study presents a controlled comparison of sixteen modern deep learning architectures spanning 2D/3D convolutional, hybrid, and volumetric transformer families for subclinical keratoconus (SKC) detection from 3D anterior segment OCT volumes. We demonstrate that hierarchical attention models offer a superior and more parameter-efficient inductive bias, surpassing the performance of both 2D and 3D CNNs and ViTs. Our results show 21-23% higher sensitivity and specificity in the sparse anomaly (subclinical) regime. Mechanistic analyses reveal that this advantage stems from precise spatial scale alignment: hierarchical windowing produces effective receptive fields matched to the intermediate, multi-slice extent of subclinical abnormalities. This avoids excessive CNN locality and diffuse global attention. Attention-distance measurements confirm a key insight into architectural adaptation: the required spatial integration length shifts significantly based on the signal strength, with subclinical cases necessitating longer integration compared to both healthy and manifest disease states. Representational similarity and auxiliary age/sex prediction tasks further support the generalizability of these inductive principles. The findings provide design guidance for future volumetric anomaly detection systems, establishing hierarchical attention as a principled and effective approach for early pathological change analysis in 3D medical imaging.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e8616\u79cd\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u67b6\u6784\u57283D\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u5f31\u5206\u5e03\u6027\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5206\u5c42\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e9a\u4e34\u5e8a\u5706\u9525\u89d2\u819c\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5176\u4f18\u52bf\u6e90\u4e8e\u8de8\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5339\u914d\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf2D/3D CNN\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u8fc7\u5f3a\u548cViT\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u53d1\u6563\u6027\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u4e2d\u5fae\u5f31\u3001\u975e\u8fde\u7eed\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u75c5\u7406\u4fe1\u53f7\u68c0\u6d4b\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u4e9f\u5f85\u63a2\u7d22\u9002\u914d\u7a00\u758f\u4e09\u7ef4\u6a21\u5f0f\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e3D\u524d\u8282OCT\u4f53\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b\u5377\u79ef\u3001\u6df7\u5408\u548c\u4f53\u79efTransformer\u7b49\u67b6\u6784\u768416\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u7167\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u673a\u68b0\u5206\u6790\u63a2\u7a76\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8868\u5f81\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5e74\u9f84/\u6027\u522b\u9884\u6d4b\u8f85\u52a9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u666e\u9002\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u5c42\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e9a\u4e34\u5e8a\u7a00\u758f\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\uff0c\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u548c\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u6bd4CNN/ViT\u63d0\u534721-23%\uff1b\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8ddd\u79bb\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u4e0d\u540c\u75c5\u7406\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u6574\u5408\u957f\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u4e9a\u4e34\u5e8a\u671f\u9700\u66f4\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u6574\u5408\uff1b\u7a7a\u95f4\u7a97\u53e3\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0e\u75c5\u7076\u8de8\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u5339\u914d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u611f\u53d7\u91ce\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e09\u7ef4\u533b\u5b66\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u5e94\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5176\u901a\u8fc7\u7a7a\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\u673a\u5236\u5e73\u8861\u5c40\u90e8\u7ec6\u8282\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u4e3a\u65e9\u671f\u75c5\u7406\u5fae\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u517c\u5177\u539f\u5219\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u81f3\u5176\u4ed6\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

This study presents the first comprehensive empirical mapping of GenAI adoption, usage patterns, and literacy in Italy, based on newly collected survey data from 1,906 Italian-speaking adults. Our findings reveal widespread adoption for both work and personal use, including sensitive tasks like emotional support and medical advice. Crucially, GenAI is supplanting other technologies to become a primary information source: this trend persists despite low user digital literacy, posing a risk as users struggle to recognize errors or misinformation. Moreover, we identify a significant gender divide -- particularly pronounced in older generations -- where women are half as likely to adopt GenAI and use it less frequently than men. While we find literacy to be a key predictor of adoption, it only partially explains this disparity, suggesting that other barriers are at play.

For model interpretability enhancement, the study integrated Grad-CAM for the visualization of decision-making regions in CT scans and SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) for explanation of feature contributions within the SVM model. Intensive evaluation was performed, and it was found that both DenseNet169 and SVM models achieved 98% accuracy, suggesting their robustness for real-world medical practice.

Featuring multiple engineering objectives, Hydro-SE is an inherently interdisciplinary domain that integrates scientific knowledge with engineering expertise. This integration necessitates extensive expert collaboration in decision-making, which poses difficulties for intelligence. With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), their potential application in the Hydro-SE domain is being increasingly explored. However, the knowledge and application abilities of LLMs in Hydro-SE have not been sufficiently evaluated. To address this issue, we propose the Hydro-SE LLM evaluation benchmark (Hydro-SE Bench), which contains 4,000 multiple-choice questions. Hydro-SE Bench covers nine subfields and enables evaluation of LLMs in aspects of basic conceptual knowledge, engineering application ability, and reasoning and calculation ability. The evaluation results on Hydro-SE Bench show that the accuracy values vary among 0.74 to 0.80 for commercial LLMs, and among 0.41 to 0.68 for small-parameter LLMs. While LLMs perform well in subfields closely related to natural and physical sciences, they struggle with domain-specific knowledge such as industry standards and hydraulic structures. Model scaling mainly improves reasoning and calculation abilities, but there is still great potential for LLMs to better handle problems in practical engineering application.

However, existing research predominantly focuses on coarse spatiotemporal scales and relies on low-resolution satellite data, capturing only macroscopic fire states while fundamentally constraining high-precision localized fire dynamics modeling capabilities. To bridge this gap, we present FireSentry, a provincial-scale multi-modal wildfire dataset characterized by sub-meter spatial and sub-second temporal resolution. Collected using synchronized UAV platforms, FireSentry provides visible and infrared video streams, in-situ environmental measurements, and manually validated fire masks. Building on FireSentry, we establish a comprehensive benchmark encompassing physics-based, data-driven, and generative models, revealing the limitations of existing mask-only approaches. Our analysis proposes FiReDiff, a novel dual-modality paradigm that first predicts future video sequences in the infrared modality, and then precisely segments fire masks in the mask modality based on the generated dynamics.

We investigate whether different syntactic phenomena recruit shared or distinct components in LLMs. Using a functional localization approach inspired by cognitive neuroscience, we identify the LLM units most responsive to 67 English syntactic phenomena in seven open-weight models. These units are consistently recruited across sentences containing the phenomena and causally support the models' syntactic performance. Critically, different types of syntactic agreement (e.g., subject-verb, anaphor, determiner-noun) recruit overlapping sets of units, suggesting that agreement constitutes a meaningful functional category for LLMs. This pattern holds in English, Russian, and Chinese; and further, in a cross-lingual analysis of 57 diverse languages, structurally more similar languages share more units for subject-verb agreement. Taken together, these findings reveal that syntactic agreement-a critical marker of syntactic dependencies-constitutes a meaningful category within LLMs' representational spaces.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4e0d\u540c\u53e5\u6cd5\u4e00\u81f4\u73b0\u8c61\uff08\u5982\u4e3b\u8c13\u4e00\u81f4\u3001\u7167\u5e94\u3001\u9650\u5b9a\u8bcd-\u540d\u8bcd\u4e00\u81f4\uff09\u4f9d\u8d56\u91cd\u53e0\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5355\u5143\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u53e5\u6cd5\u4e00\u81f4\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u663e\u793a\u7ed3\u6784\u76f8\u4f3c\u8bed\u8a00\u5171\u4eab\u66f4\u591a\u4e3b\u8c13\u4e00\u81f4\u76f8\u5173\u5355\u5143\u3002", "motivation": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5982\u4f55\u8868\u5f81\u8bed\u6cd5\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u4e0d\u540c\u53e5\u6cd5\u89c4\u5219\uff08\u5982\u540c\u4e00\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u6216\u4f9d\u5b58\u5173\u7cfb\uff09\u662f\u5426\u8c03\u7528\u5171\u4eab\u6216\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u90e8\u4ef6\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u53d7\u8ba4\u77e5\u795e\u7ecf\u79d1\u5b66\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u67907\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u54cd\u5e9467\u79cd\u82f1\u8bed\u53e5\u6cd5\u73b0\u8c61\u768412200\u4e2a\u5355\u5143\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u6bd4\u8f8357\u79cd\u7ed3\u6784\u76f8\u4f3c\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u4e3b\u8c13\u4e00\u81f4\u5355\u5143\u91cd\u5408\u5ea6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u666e\u9002\u6027\u3002", "result": "1) \u540c\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u5185\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u53e5\u6cd5\u4e00\u81f4\u7c7b\u578b\u663e\u8457\u8c03\u7528\u91cd\u53e0\u5355\u5143\uff1b2) \u82f1\u8bed\u3001\u4fc4\u8bed\u3001\u4e2d\u6587\u5747\u5448\u73b0\u8be5\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b3) \u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u53e5\u6cd5\u7ed3\u6784\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u8d8a\u9ad8\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u4e3b\u8c13\u4e00\u81f4\u76f8\u5173\u5355\u5143\u5171\u4eab\u6bd4\u4f8b\u8d8a\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53e5\u6cd5\u4e00\u81f4\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u53e5\u6cd5\u4f9d\u5b58\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u6784\u6210\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u8303\u7574\uff0c\u4e14\u8bed\u8a00\u7ed3\u6784\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u51b3\u5b9a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u91cd\u5408\u5ea6\u3002"}}

Gaussian-based methods have demonstrated superior performance and computational efficiency across a wide range of scene understanding tasks. However, existing methods either model objects as closed-set semantic Gaussians supervised by annotated 3D labels, neglecting their rendering ability, or learn open-set Gaussian representations via purely 2D self-supervision, leading to degraded geometry and limited to camera-only settings. To fully exploit the potential of Gaussians, we propose a Multi-Modal Gaussian Transformer that enables Gaussians to query features from diverse sensor modalities, and a Shelf-Supervised Learning Paradigm that efficiently optimizes Gaussians with VFM features jointly at 2D image and 3D scene levels. We evaluate ShelfGaussian on various perception and planning tasks. Experiments on Occ3D-nuScenes demonstrate its state-of-the-art zero-shot semantic occupancy prediction performance. ShelfGaussian is further evaluated on an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) to assess its in the-wild performance across diverse urban scenarios.

However, the substantial modality gap between optical and SAR images poses a major challenge for robust identification. To address this issue, we propose MOS, a novel framework designed to mitigate the optical-SAR modality gap and achieve modality-consistent feature learning for optical-SAR cross-modal ship ReID. MOS consists of two core components: (1) Modality-Consistent Representation Learning (MCRL) applies denoise SAR image procession and a class-wise modality alignment loss to align intra-identity feature distributions across modalities. (2) Cross-modal Data Generation and Feature fusion (CDGF) leverages a brownian bridge diffusion model to synthesize cross-modal samples, which are subsequently fused with original features during inference to enhance alignment and discriminability. Extensive experiments on the HOSS ReID dataset demonstrate that MOS significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods across all evaluation protocols, achieving notable improvements of +3.0%, +6.2%, and +16.4% in R1 accuracy under the ALL to ALL, Optical to SAR, and SAR to Optical settings, respectively.

Code available at https://github.com/lyj20071013/DZ-TDPO", "summary": "Long-context dialogue systems suffer from State Inertia, where static constraints prevent models from resolving conflicts between evolving user intents and established historical context. To address this, we propose DZ-TDPO, a non-destructive alignment framework that synergizes conflict-aware dynamic KL constraints with a learnable temporal attention bias. Experiments on the Multi-Session Chat (MSC) dataset demonstrate that DZ-TDPO achieves state-of-the-art win rates (86.2% on Phi-3.5) while maintaining robust zero-shot generalization. Crucially, our scaling analysis reveals a \"Capacity-Stability Trade-off\": while smaller models incur an \"alignment tax\" (perplexity surge) to overcome historical inertia, the larger Qwen2.5-7B model achieves near-perfect alignment (99.4% win rate) with negligible perplexity overhead.

We introduce the ViDiC (Video Difference Captioning) task and its corresponding ViDiC-1K dataset, designed to evaluate the ability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to provide fine-grained descriptions of similarities and differences between video pairs. ViDiC-1K comprises 1,000 curated video pairs annotated with over 4,000 comparative checklist items, covering seven categories: subject, style, background, cinematography, motion, location, and playback techniques. To ensure reliable evaluation, we propose a dual-checklist framework that measures the accuracy of similarity and difference separately, based on the LLM-as-a-Judge protocol. Experiments on nineteen representative multimodal models reveal a significant performance gap in their comparative description and difference perception abilities.

However, most affordance learning methods focus solely on \"how\" objects can be used while neglecting the \"what\" and \"where\" aspects. Other affordance detection methods treat object detection and affordance learning as two independent tasks, lacking effective interaction and real-time capability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce YOLO Affordance (YOLOA), a real-time affordance detection model that jointly handles these two tasks via a large language model (LLM) adapter. Specifically, YOLOA employs a lightweight detector consisting of object detection and affordance learning branches refined through the LLM Adapter. During training, the LLM Adapter interacts with object and affordance preliminary predictions to refine both branches by generating more accurate class priors, box offsets, and affordance gates. Experiments on our relabeled ADG-Det and IIT-Heat benchmarks demonstrate that YOLOA achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (52.8 / 73.1 mAP on ADG-Det / IIT-Heat) while maintaining real-time performance (up to 89.77 FPS, and up to 846.24 FPS for the lightweight variant).

The attack works by systematically replacing a harmful keyword (e.g., \\textit{bomb}) with a benign token (e.g., \\textit{carrot}) across multiple in-context examples, provided a prefix to a harmful request. We demonstrate that this substitution leads to the internal representation of the benign token converging toward that of the harmful one, effectively embedding the harmful semantics under a euphemism. As a result, superficially innocuous prompts (e.g., ``How to build a carrot?'') are internally interpreted as disallowed instructions (e.g., ``How to build a bomb?''), thereby bypassing the model's safety alignment.

We present a label-efficient framework that leverages spatial features from a frozen diffusion model pretrained on natural images. Our approach extracts low-level representations from high-resolution decoder layers at early denoising timesteps, which transfer effectively to the low-texture structure of HSI. To integrate spectral and spatial information, we introduce a lightweight FiLM-based fusion module that adaptively modulates frozen spatial features using spectral cues, enabling robust multimodal learning under sparse supervision. Experiments on two recent hyperspectral datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches using only the provided sparse training labels. Ablation studies further highlight the benefits of diffusion-derived features and spectral-aware fusion.

However, LLM output - here, the category assigned to a text - depends heavily on the wording of the prompt. While literature on prompt engineering is expanding, few studies focus on classification tasks, and even fewer address domains like psychology, where constructs have precise, theory-driven definitions that may not be well represented in pre-training data. We present an empirical framework for optimizing LLM performance for identifying constructs in texts via prompt engineering. We experimentally evaluate five prompting strategies --codebook-guided empirical prompt selection, automatic prompt engineering, persona prompting, chain-of-thought reasoning, and explanatory prompting - with zero-shot and few-shot classification. We find that persona, chain-of-thought, and explanations do not fully address performance loss accompanying a badly worded prompt. Instead, the most influential features of a prompt are the construct definition, task framing, and, to a lesser extent, the examples provided. Across three constructs and two models, the classifications most aligned with expert judgments resulted from a few-shot prompt combining codebook-guided empirical prompt selection with automatic prompt engineering. Based on our findings, we recommend that researchers generate and evaluate as many prompt variants as feasible, whether human-crafted, automatically generated, or ideally both, and select prompts and examples based on empirical performance in a training dataset, validating the final approach in a holdout set. This procedure offers a practical, systematic, and theory-driven method for optimizing LLM prompts in settings where alignment with expert judgment is critical.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u6587\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u4e00\u81f4\u6027", "motivation": "LLMs\u867d\u64c5\u957f\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u4f46\u8f93\u51fa\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u3002\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u7b49\u7406\u8bba\u9a71\u52a8\u9886\u57df\u9700\u7cbe\u51c6\u6355\u6349\u6784\u5ff5\uff08constructs\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9002\u914d\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u672a\u5145\u5206\u89e3\u51b3\u4e0d\u826f\u63aa\u8f9e\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u63a2\u7d22\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e94\u79cd\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff1a\u4ee3\u7801\u7c3f\u5f15\u5bfc\u63d0\u793a\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u81ea\u52a8\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u3001\u89d2\u8272\u6697\u793a\u3001\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u4e0e\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e3\u4e2a\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u6784\u5ff5\u548c2\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e0d\u540c\u7b56\u7565\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u89d2\u8272\u626e\u6f14\u3001\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u63d0\u793a\u672a\u80fd\u5b8c\u5168\u5f25\u8865\u5dee\u63d0\u793a\u3002\u6700\u4f73\u6548\u679c\u6765\u81ea\u7ed3\u5408\u4ee3\u7801\u7c3f\u7ecf\u9a8c\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u81ea\u52a8\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u6784\u5ff5\u4e2d\u5747\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u5224\u65ad\u6700\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u5173\u952e\u63d0\u793a\u8981\u7d20\u4e3a\u6784\u5ff5\u5b9a\u4e49\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u6846\u67b6\u53ca\u793a\u4f8b\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63a8\u8350\u591a\u7ef4\u63d0\u793a\u5f00\u53d1\uff08\u4eba\u5de5+\u81ea\u52a8\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f73\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u9a8c\u8bc1\u96c6\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7406\u8bba\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e13\u4e1a\u9886\u57dfLLM\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

Consensus rules also enable an automatic evaluation of the model's inference process regarding its derivation correctness (evaluating correct and faithful deduction of a conclusion from given premises) and value correctness (comparing predicted values against real-world measurements). We exemplify our work using the complex Sepsis-3 consensus definition. Our experiments show that small fine-tuned models outperform one-shot learning of considerably larger LLMs that are prompted with the explicit definition and models that are trained on medical texts including consensus definitions. Since fine-tuning on verbalized rule instantiations of a specific medical area yields nearly perfect derivation correctness for rules (and exceptions) on unseen patient data in that area, the bottleneck for early prediction is not out-of-distribution generalization, but the orthogonal problem of generalization into the future by forecasting sparsely and irregularly sampled clinical variables. We show that the latter results can be improved by integrating the output representations of a time series forecasting model with the LLM in a multimodal setup.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper addresses the need for trustworthy machine learning models in medicine by teaching LLMs to follow medical consensus guidelines step-by-step, achieving high accuracy in reasoning while highlighting the challenge of forecasting sparse clinical variables for early prediction.", "motivation": "To build trust among medical practitioners by ensuring models follow established medical consensus guidelines, balancing prediction accuracy with faithful explanations and enabling automatic evaluation of reasoning correctness.", "method": "Fine-tuned LLMs on electronic health records linked to verbalized medical inference rules and exceptions, using consensus guidelines like Sepsis-3 for evaluation.

Most existing work relies on manual ROIs and rarely reports quality control (QC). We present LM-CartSeg, a fully automatic pipeline for cartilage/bone segmentation, geometric lateral/medial (L/M) compartmentalisation and radiomics analysis. Methods: Two 3D nnU-Net models were trained on SKM-TEA (138 knees) and OAIZIB-CM (404 knees). At test time, zero-shot predictions were fused and refined by simple geometric rules: connected-component cleaning, construction of 10 mm subchondral bone bands in physical space, and a data-driven tibial L/M split based on PCA and k-means. Segmentation was evaluated on an OAIZIB-CM test set (103 knees) and on SKI-10 (100 knees). QC used volume and thickness signatures. From 10 ROIs we extracted 4 650 non-shape radiomic features to study inter-compartment similarity, dependence on ROI size, and OA vs. non-OA classification on OAIZIB-CM Results: Post-processing improved macro ASSD on OAIZIB-CM from 2.63 to 0.36 mm and HD95 from 25.2 to 3.35 mm, with DSC 0.91; zero-shot DSC on SKI-10 was 0.80. The geometric L/M rule produced stable compartments across datasets, whereas a direct L/M nnU-Net showed domain-dependent side swaps. Only 6 to 12 percent of features per ROI were strongly correlated with volume or thickness. Radiomics-based models models restricted to size-linked features.

Although Cross-layer KV Cache sharing (e.g., YOCO, CLA) offers a path to mitigate KV Cache bottleneck, it typically underperforms within-layer methods like GQA. To understand the root cause, we investigate the information flow of keys and values of the top-layers. Our preliminary reveals a clear distribution: values are predominantly derived from the bottom layer, while keys draw more information from both bottom and middle layers. Building upon this, we propose FusedKV, whose top-layer KV caches are a learnable fusion of the most informative ones from the bottom and middle layers. This fusion operates directly on post-RoPE keys, preserving relative positional information without the computational cost of re-applying rotary embeddings. To further improve efficiency, we propose FusedKV-Lite, an cross-layer sharing approach, where top-layer KV caches are directly derived from the bottom-layer values and the middle-layer keys. Compared to FusedKV, FusedKV-Lite reduces I/O overhead at the cost of a slight increase in perplexity.

In this paper, we argue that language models should aim to capture the full spectrum of language variation (dialectal, historical, informal, etc.) rather than relying solely on standardized text. Focusing on Basque, a morphologically rich and low-resource language, we construct new corpora combining standard, social media, and historical sources, and pre-train the BERnaT family of encoder-only models in three configurations: standard, diverse, and combined.

However, most existing approaches operate purely in the 2D pixel space and lack explicit mechanisms for modeling 3D structures, often resulting in temporally inconsistent geometries, implausible motions, and structural artifacts. In this work, we introduce geometric regularization losses into video generation by augmenting latent diffusion models with per-frame depth prediction. We adopted depth as the geometric representation because of the great progress in depth prediction and its compatibility with image-based latent encoders. Specifically, to enforce structural consistency over time, we propose a multi-view geometric loss that aligns the predicted depth maps across frames within a shared 3D coordinate system. Our method bridges the gap between appearance generation and 3D structure modeling, leading to improved spatio-temporal coherence, shape consistency, and physical plausibility.

Existing visual grounding (VG) methods for autonomous vehicles (AVs) typically struggle with ambiguous, context-dependent instructions, as they lack reasoning over 3D spatial relations and anticipated scene evolution. Grounded in the principles of world models, we propose ThinkDeeper, a framework that reasons about future spatial states before making grounding decisions. At its core is a Spatial-Aware World Model (SA-WM) that learns to reason ahead by distilling the current scene into a command-aware latent state and rolling out a sequence of future latent states, providing forward-looking cues for disambiguation. Complementing this, a hypergraph-guided decoder then hierarchically fuses these states with the multimodal input, capturing higher-order spatial dependencies for robust localization.

We propose continued BPE training, which adapts a pre-trained tokenizer by continuing the BPE merge learning process on new data. Experiments across multiple languages and model families show that this approach improves tokenization efficiency and leads to better utilization of added vocabulary.

However, achieving practical performance typically requires task-specific fine-tuning with large numbers of image-text pairs, which are costly to collect. In this work, we study text-centric training, a setting where only textual descriptions are available and no real images are provided, as a paradigm for low-cost data scaling. Unlike images, whose collection is often restricted by privacy constraints and scarcity in niche domains, text is widely available. Moreover, text is easily editable, enabling automatic diversification and expansion with LLMs at minimal human effort. While this offers clear advantages over image collection in terms of scalability and cost, training on raw text without images still yields limited gains on VQA tasks because of the image-text modality gap. To address this issue, we propose a Text-Printed Image (TPI), which generates synthetic images by directly rendering the given textual description on a plain white canvas. This simple rendering projects text into the image modality and can be integrated into arbitrary existing LVLM training pipelines at low cost. Moreover, TPI preserves the semantics of the text, whereas text-to-image models often fail to do. Across four models and seven benchmarks, our systematic experiments show that TPI enables more effective text-centric training than synthetic images generated by a diffusion model. We further explore TPI as a low-cost data-augmentation strategy and demonstrate its practical utility.

To achieve this, inference systems must maximize request handling within latency constraints, referred to as increasing effective throughput. However, existing systems face two major challenges: (i) reliance on first-come-first-served (FCFS) scheduling causes severe head-of-line blocking, leading to queuing delays exceeding the SLOs for many requests; and (ii) static batch token limit, which fails to adapt to fluctuating loads and hardware conditions. Both of these factors degrade effective throughput and service quality.\n  This paper presents AugServe, an efficient inference framework designed to reduce queueing latency and enhance effective throughput for augmented LLM inference services. The core idea of AugServe is a two-stage adaptive request scheduling strategy. Specifically, AugServe combines the inference features of augmented LLM requests to optimize the order of scheduling decisions (stage I). These decisions are continuously refined with runtime information (stage II), adapting to both request characteristics and system capabilities. In addition, AugServe dynamically adjusts the token batching mechanism based on hardware status and real-time load, further enhancing throughput performance. Experimental results show that AugServe achieves 4.7-33.1x and 3.3-13.2x higher effective throughput than vLLM and InferCept, while reducing time-to-first-token (TTFT) by up to 96.3% and 95.0%, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "AugServe\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u9636\u6bb5\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u5ea6\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u8d44\u6e90\u8c03\u6574\u63d0\u5347\u589e\u5f3a\u578bLLM\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u6709\u6548\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u548c\u54cd\u5e94\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u56e0FCFS\u8c03\u5ea6\u5bfc\u81f4\u5934\u963b\u585e\u548c\u9759\u6001\u6279\u5904\u7406\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0e\u786c\u4ef6\u6ce2\u52a8\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u670d\u52a1\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u9636\u6bb5\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u9636\u6bb5I\u7ed3\u5408\u8bf7\u6c42\u7279\u5f81\u4f18\u5316\u8c03\u5ea6\u987a\u5e8f\uff0c\u9636\u6bb5II\u6839\u636e\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u4fe1\u606f\u5b9e\u65f6\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u5206\u6279\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u4e0evLLM\u548cInferCept\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u53474.7-33.1\u500d\uff0c\u9996\u5b57\u8282\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c11\u6700\u9ad896.3%\u3002", "conclusion": "AugServe\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u8d44\u6e90\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u589e\u5f37\u578bLLM\u670d\u52a1\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Existing approaches primarily analyze how an action is performed, while overlooking what it produces, i.e., the \\textbf{action effect}. Yet many errors manifest not in the execution itself but in the resulting outcome, such as an unintended object state or incorrect spatial arrangement. To address this gap, we propose Action Effect Modeling (AEM), a unified framework that jointly captures action execution and its outcomes through a probabilistic formulation. AEM first identifies the outcome of an action by selecting the most informative effect frame based on semantic relevance and visual quality. It then extracts complementary cues from visual grounding and symbolic scene graphs, aligning them in a shared latent space to form robust effect-aware representations. To detect mistakes, we further design a prompt-based detector that incorporates task-specific prompts and aligns each action segment with its intended execution semantics. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the EgoPER and CaptainCook4D benchmarks under the challenging one-class classification (OCC) setting. These results demonstrate that modeling both execution and outcome yields more reliable mistake detection, and highlight the potential of effect-aware representations to benefit a broader range of downstream applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aAction Effect Modeling (AEM)\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u901a\u8fc7\u540c\u65f6\u6355\u6349\u52a8\u4f5c\u6267\u884c\u53ca\u5176\u7ed3\u679c\uff08\u5373\u52a8\u4f5c\u6548\u5e94\uff09\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u68c0\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u52a8\u4f5c\u6267\u884c\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u52a8\u4f5c\u7ed3\u679c\uff08\u5982\u5bf9\u8c61\u72b6\u6001\u6216\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e03\u5c40\u5f02\u5e38\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u8bb8\u591a\u9519\u8bef\u5b9e\u5219\u4f53\u73b0\u5728\u7ed3\u679c\u4e2d\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7f3a\u53e3\u3002", "method": "AEM\u901a\u8fc7\u6982\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u52a8\u4f5c\u6267\u884c\u4e0e\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u5176\u6b65\u9aa4\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1\uff09\u9009\u62e9\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u5173\u4e14\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u9ad8\u7684\u6548\u5e94\u5e27\uff1b2\uff09\u878d\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u7b26\u53f7\u5316\u573a\u666f\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u6548\u5e94\u611f\u77e5\u8868\u5f81\uff1b3\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u5bf9\u9f50\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u610f\u56fe\u3002", "result": "\u5728EgoPER\u548cCaptainCook4D\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684one-class classification\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u52a8\u4f5c\u6267\u884c\u4e0e\u7ed3\u679c\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u5408\u52a8\u4f5c\u6267\u884c\u4e0e\u7ed3\u679c\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u9519\u8bef\u68c0\u6d4b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u6548\u5e94\u611f\u77e5\u8868\u5f81\u5bf9\u5176\u4ed6\u4e0b\u6e38\u5e94\u7528\u5177\u6709\u666e\u9002\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Previous work has shown that when a base language model exhibits these skills, training that model further with reinforcement learning (RL) can learn to leverage them. How can we get models to leverage skills that aren't exhibited by base models? Our work, SkillFactory, is a method for fine-tuning models to roughly learn these skills during a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage prior to RL. Our approach does not rely on distillation from a stronger model, but instead uses samples from the model itself, rearranged to provide training data in the format of those skills. These \"silver\" SFT traces may be imperfect, but are nevertheless effective for priming a model to acquire skills during RL. Our evaluation shows that (1) starting from SkillFactory SFT initialization helps a model to generalize to harder variants of a task post-RL, despite lower performance pre-RL; (2) cognitive skills are indeed used by the model; (3) RLed SkillFactory models are more robust to regression on out-of-domain tasks than RLed base models.

However, adapting SAM to specific downstream tasks, such as medical and agricultural imaging, remains a significant challenge. To address this, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and its variants have been widely employed to enhancing SAM's adaptation performance on diverse domains. Despite advancements, a critical question arises: can we integrate inductive bias into the model? This is particularly relevant since the Transformer encoder in SAM inherently lacks spatial priors within image patches, potentially hindering the acquisition of high-level semantic information. In this paper, we propose NAS-LoRA, a new Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method designed to bridge the semantic gap between pre-trained SAM and specialized domains. Specifically, NAS-LoRA incorporates a lightweight Neural Architecture Search (NAS) block between the encoder and decoder components of LoRA to dynamically optimize the prior knowledge integrated into weight updates. Furthermore, we propose a stage-wise optimization strategy to help the ViT encoder balance weight updates and architectural adjustments, facilitating the gradual learning of high-level semantic information.

However, their ability to interpret cartographic maps remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce CartoMapQA, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LVLMs' understanding of cartographic maps through question-answering tasks. The dataset includes over 2000 samples, each composed of a cartographic map, a question (with open-ended or multiple-choice answers), and a ground-truth answer. These tasks span key low-, mid- and high-level map interpretation skills, including symbol recognition, embedded information extraction, scale interpretation, and route-based reasoning. Our evaluation of both open-source and proprietary LVLMs reveals persistent challenges: models frequently struggle with map-specific semantics, exhibit limited geospatial reasoning, and are prone to Optical Character Recognition (OCR)-related errors. By isolating these weaknesses, CartoMapQA offers a valuable tool for guiding future improvements in LVLM architectures. Ultimately, it supports the development of models better equipped for real-world applications that depend on robust and reliable map understanding, such as navigation, geographic search, and urban planning.

Comparing their vision encoder against simple alternatives--parameter-free mean pooling and a learned hierarchical encoder--we find that these simple approaches match or surpass vision for reconstruction at matched compression ratios, and outperform it for language modeling--where vision-based compression fails to beat truncation.

However, they overlook the semantic misalignment between visual and textual contexts, which arises due to the rigidity of a fixed context prompt learned on a single source domain. To this end, we present a novel domain generalization framework for semantic segmentation, namely Domain-aware Prompt-driven Masked Transformer (DPMFormer). Firstly, we introduce domain-aware prompt learning to facilitate semantic alignment between visual and textual cues. To capture various domain-specific properties with a single source dataset, we propose domain-aware contrastive learning along with the texture perturbation that diversifies the observable domains. Lastly, to establish a framework resilient against diverse environmental changes, we have proposed the domain-robust consistency learning which guides the model to minimize discrepancies of prediction from original and the augmented images. Through experiments and analyses, we demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework, which establishes a new state-of-the-art on various DGSS benchmarks.

In this work, we first reveal a critical and previously overlooked weakness: even state-of-the-art MLLMs are surprisingly brittle, showing significant performance degradation on images with simple orientation changes or natural corruptions, underscoring the need for more robust tool-based reasoning. To address this, we propose CodeVision, a flexible and scalable code-as-tool framework where the model generates code as a universal interface to invoke any image operation, moving beyond fixed tool registries. We train our model using a two-stage methodology, beginning with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on a high-quality dataset curated for complex, multi-turn tool composition and error recovery, followed by Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a novel and dense process reward function to encourage strategic and efficient tool use. To facilitate this research, we construct new SFT and RL datasets and introduce a challenging new benchmark suite designed to rigorously evaluate robustness to orientation changes and multi-tool reasoning. Experiments on Qwen2.5-VL and Qwen3-VL series show that our approach significantly improves model performance and fosters emergent capabilities such as flexible tool composition, efficient chained execution, and robust error recovery from runtime feedback.

Our approach identifies dancers within video frames, counts discrete dance steps, calculates spatial coverage patterns, and measures rhythm consistency across performance sequences. Testing this framework on a single 49-second recording of Ghanaian AfroBeats dance demonstrates technical feasibility, with the system achieving approximately 94% detection precision and 89% recall on manually inspected samples. The pixel-level segmentation provided by SAM, achieving approximately 83% intersection-over-union with visual inspection, enables motion quantification that captures body configuration changes beyond what bounding-box approaches can represent. Analysis of this preliminary case study indicates that the dancer classified as primary by our system executed 23% more steps with 37% higher motion intensity and utilized 42% more performance space compared to dancers classified as secondary. However, this work represents an early-stage investigation with substantial limitations including single-video validation, absence of systematic ground truth annotations, and lack of comparison with existing pose estimation methods.

While existing efficient VLM approaches reduce visual tokens through fixed-ratio compression, they operate passively and lack the ability to adapt to varying task requirements. This motivates a fundamental question: Can VLMs autonomously determine the minimum number of visual tokens required for each sample? Inspired by human active vision mechanisms, we introduce AdaptVision, an efficient VLM paradigm that enables adaptive visual token acquisition through a coarse-to-fine approach. Our model initially processes compressed visual tokens from low-resolution images and selectively acquires additional visual information by invoking a bounding box tool to crop key regions when necessary. We train AdaptVision using a reinforcement learning framework that carefully balances accuracy and efficiency. Central to our approach is Decoupled Turn Policy Optimization (DTPO), which decouples the learning objective into two components: (1) tool learning, which optimizes correct tool utilization, and (2) accuracy improvement, which refines the generated responses to improve answer correctness. Based on this formulation, we further decouple advantage estimation by computing separate advantages for tokens associated with each objective. This formulation enables more effective optimization for AdaptVision compared to vanilla GRPO. Comprehensive experiments across multiple VQA benchmarks demonstrate that AdaptVision achieves superior performance while consuming substantially fewer visual tokens than state-of-the-art efficient VLM methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "AdaptVision \u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u89c6\u89c9 token \u83b7\u53d6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7c97\u5230\u7ec6\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u89c6\u89c9 token \u6d88\u8017\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u9ad8\u6548VLM\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u56fa\u5b9a\u538b\u7f29\u6bd4\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6839\u636e\u4efb\u52a1\u96be\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u89c6\u89c9token\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8d44\u6e90\u6d6a\u8d39\u6216\u7cbe\u5ea6\u635f\u5931\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u8d4b\u4e88\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u4e3b\u5224\u65ad\u6bcf\u6761\u6837\u672c\u6240\u9700\u6700\u5c0f\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5206\u5c42\u51b3\u7b56\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u521d\u59cb\u9636\u6bb5\u5904\u7406\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u7247\uff1b2) \u6761\u4ef6\u6027\u8c03\u7528bounding box\u5de5\u5177\u805a\u7126\u5173\u952e\u533a\u57df\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u89e3\u8026\u56de\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff08DTPO\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u4f18\u5316\uff08\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u51b3\u7b56\uff09\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\uff08\u7b54\u6848\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u4f18\u5316\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u522b\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bf9\u5e94\u76ee\u6807\u7684token\u4f18\u52bf\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2aVQA\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u89c6\u89c9token\u6d88\u8017\u91cf\u663e\u8457\u4f4e\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709SOTA\u9ad8\u6548VLM\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u538b\u7f29\u6bd4\u63d0\u53472-5\u500d\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u4eff\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e3b\u52a8\u89c6\u89c9\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u89c6\u89c9token\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0cDTPO\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

More Demo at https://stablesigner.github.io", "summary": "Sign Language Production (SLP) is the process of converting the complex input text into a real video. Most previous works focused on the Text2Gloss, Gloss2Pose, Pose2Vid stages, and some concentrated on Prompt2Gloss and Text2Avatar stages. However, this field has made slow progress due to the inaccuracy of text conversion, pose generation, and the rendering of poses into real human videos in these stages, resulting in gradually accumulating errors. Therefore, in this paper, we streamline the traditional redundant structure, simplify and optimize the task objective, and design a new sign language generative model called Stable Signer.

Given time-varying text prompts, FloodDiffusion generates text-aligned, seamless motion sequences with real-time latency.

We find that a straightforward implementation of vanilla diffusion forcing (as proposed for video models) fails to model real motion distributions. We demonstrate that to guarantee modeling the output distribution, the vanilla diffusion forcing must be tailored to: (i) train with a bi-directional attention instead of casual attention; (ii) implement a lower triangular time scheduler instead of a random one; (iii) utilize a continues time-varying way to introduce text conditioning. With these improvements, we demonstrate in the first time that the diffusion forcing-based framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on the streaming motion generation task, reaching an FID of 0.057 on the HumanML3D benchmark.

To handle this, prior approaches mainly scale the visual generation process (e.g., increasing sampling steps or seeds), but this quickly leads to a quality plateau. This limitation arises because the prompt, crucial for guiding generation, is kept fixed. To address this, we propose Prompt Redesign for Inference-time Scaling, coined PRIS, a framework that adaptively revises the prompt during inference in response to the scaled visual generations. The core idea of PRIS is to review the generated visuals, identify recurring failure patterns across visuals, and redesign the prompt accordingly before regenerating the visuals with the revised prompt. To provide precise alignment feedback for prompt revision, we introduce a new verifier, element-level factual correction, which evaluates the alignment between prompt attributes and generated visuals at a fine-grained level, achieving more accurate and interpretable assessments than holistic measures. Extensive experiments on both text-to-image and text-to-video benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, including a 15% gain on VBench 2.0.

To address this gap, we first investigate the mechanism of visual neglect and reveal it can be accurately detected via head-level activation patterns in MLLMs. We thus propose V-ITI, a lightweight visual inference-time intervention framework integrating a Visual Neglect Detector that identifies visual neglect via head-level discriminative probes and a Visual Recall Intervenor that modulates activations with prestored visual activation information only when the visual neglect is detected. Extensive experiments across eight benchmarks and different MLLM families demonstrate that V-ITI consistently mitigates vision-related hallucinations while preserving general task performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faV-ITI\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u76f8\u5173\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5e72\u9884\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u5ffd\u7565'\u4f55\u65f6\u5e72\u9884'\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u65b0\u5e7b\u89c9\u5e76\u589e\u52a0\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cbe\u51c6\u63a7\u5236\u5e72\u9884\u65f6\u673a", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5934\u90e8\u5c42\u7ea7\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6a21\u5f0f\u68c0\u6d4b\u89c6\u89c9\u5ffd\u89c6\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u89c6\u89c9\u5ffd\u89c6\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u56de\u60f3\u5e72\u9884\u8005\uff0c\u4ec5\u5728\u5fc5\u8981\u65f6\u523b\u8c03\u7528\u9884\u5b58\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u8fdb\u884c\u6fc0\u6d3b\u8c03\u5236", "result": "\u57288\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4e0d\u540cMLLM\u5bb6\u65cf\u4e2d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u89c6\u89c9\u76f8\u5173\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u539f\u6709\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd", "conclusion": "V-ITI\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u51c6\u5e72\u9884\u65f6\u673a\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u53ef\u9760\u6027"}}

This hybrid design enables robust detection of both explicit violations and novel edge cases that evade traditional classifiers. Multimodal inputs (text, audio, visual) are processed through both pipelines, with a multimodal large language model (MLLM) distilling knowledge into each to boost accuracy while keeping inference lightweight. In production, the classification pipeline achieves 67% recall at 80% precision, and the similarity pipeline achieves 76% recall at 80% precision.

Camera-ready version accepted for IEEE BIBM 2025", "summary": "Universal, transferable whole-slide image (WSI) representations are central to computational pathology. Incorporating multiple markers (e.g., immunohistochemistry, IHC) alongside H&E enriches H&E-based features with diverse, biologically meaningful information. However, progress is limited by the scarcity of well-aligned multi-stain datasets. Inter-stain misalignment shifts corresponding tissue across slides, hindering consistent patch-level features and degrading slide-level embeddings. To address this, we curated a slide-level aligned, five-stain dataset (H&E, HER2, KI67, ER, PGR) to enable paired H&E-IHC learning and robust cross-stain representation. Leveraging this dataset, we propose Cross-Stain Contrastive Learning (CSCL), a two-stage pretraining framework with a lightweight adapter trained using patch-wise contrastive alignment to improve the compatibility of H&E features with corresponding IHC-derived contextual cues, and slide-level representation learning with Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), which uses a cross-stain attention fusion module to integrate stain-specific patch features and a cross-stain global alignment module to enforce consistency among slide-level embeddings across different stains. Experiments on cancer subtype classification, IHC biomarker status classification, and survival prediction show consistent gains, yielding high-quality, transferable H&E slide-level representations.

The inherent complexity of this task stems from the intricate relationship between sequence and structure, making it particularly challenging. In this paper, we propose a framework, named HyperRNA, a generative model with an encoder-decoder architecture that leverages hypergraphs to design RNA sequences. Specifically, our HyperRNA model consists of three main components: preprocessing, encoding and decoding.\n  In the preprocessing stage, graph structures are constructed by extracting the atom coordinates of RNA backbone based on 3-bead coarse-grained representation. The encoding stage processes these graphs, capturing higher order dependencies and complex biomolecular interactions using an attention embedding module and a hypergraph-based encoder. Finally, the decoding stage generates the RNA sequence in an autoregressive manner. We conducted quantitative and qualitative experiments on the PDBBind and RNAsolo datasets to evaluate the inverse folding task for RNA sequence generation and RNA-protein complex sequence generation.

CloseUpAvatar represents an avatar as a set of textured planes with two sets of learnable textures for low and high-frequency detail. The method automatically switches to high-frequency textures only for cameras positioned close to the avatar's surface and gradually reduces their impact as the camera moves farther away.

While Vision Transformers that leverage shifted window-based self-attention have established new benchmarks in this field, they are often hampered by a critical limitation: their localized attention mechanism struggles to effectively fuse local details with global context. This deficiency is particularly detrimental to challenging tasks such as the segmentation of microtumors and miniature organs, where both fine-grained boundary definition and broad contextual understanding are paramount. To address this gap, we propose HBFormer, a novel Hybrid-Bridge Transformer architecture. The 'Hybrid' design of HBFormer synergizes a classic U-shaped encoder-decoder framework with a powerful Swin Transformer backbone for robust hierarchical feature extraction. The core innovation lies in its 'Bridge' mechanism, a sophisticated nexus for multi-scale feature integration. This bridge is architecturally embodied by our novel Multi-Scale Feature Fusion (MFF) decoder. Departing from conventional symmetric designs, the MFF decoder is engineered to fuse multi-scale features from the encoder with global contextual information. It achieves this through a synergistic combination of channel and spatial attention modules, which are constructed from a series of dilated and depth-wise convolutions. These components work in concert to create a powerful feature bridge that explicitly captures long-range dependencies and refines object boundaries with exceptional precision. Comprehensive experiments on challenging medical image segmentation datasets, including multi-organ, liver tumor, and bladder tumor benchmarks, demonstrate that HBFormer achieves state-of-the-art results, showcasing its outstanding capabilities in microtumor and miniature organ segmentation.

We propose a retrieval-augmented framework for tooth completion that integrates a prototype memory into standard encoder--decoder pipelines. After encoding a partial input into a global descriptor, the model retrieves the nearest manifold prototype from a learnable memory and fuses it with the query feature through confidence-gated weighting before decoding. The memory is optimized end-to-end and self-organizes into reusable tooth-shape prototypes without requiring tooth-position labels, thereby providing structural priors that stabilize missing-region inference and free decoder capacity for detail recovery. The module is plug-and-play and compatible with common completion backbones, while keeping the same training losses.

However, despite their strong generalization capabilities, these models often lack 3D consistency, a fundamental requirement for understanding scene geometry and motion, thereby causing severe spatial misalignment and temporal flickering in complex 3D environments. In this paper, we present Motion4D, a novel framework that addresses these challenges by integrating 2D priors from foundation models into a unified 4D Gaussian Splatting representation. Our method features a two-part iterative optimization framework: 1) Sequential optimization, which updates motion and semantic fields in consecutive stages to maintain local consistency, and 2) Global optimization, which jointly refines all attributes for long-term coherence. To enhance motion accuracy, we introduce a 3D confidence map that dynamically adjusts the motion priors, and an adaptive resampling process that inserts new Gaussians into under-represented regions based on per-pixel RGB and semantic errors. Furthermore, we enhance semantic coherence through an iterative refinement process that resolves semantic inconsistencies by alternately optimizing the semantic fields and updating prompts of SAM2. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our Motion4D significantly outperforms both 2D foundation models and existing 3D-based approaches across diverse scene understanding tasks, including point-based tracking, video object segmentation, and novel view synthesis.

Among these, motion control - specifying object dynamics and camera trajectories - is essential for composing complex, cinematic scenes, yet existing interfaces remain limited. We introduce LAMP that leverages large language models (LLMs) as motion planners to translate natural language descriptions into explicit 3D trajectories for dynamic objects and (relatively defined) cameras. LAMP defines a motion domain-specific language (DSL), inspired by cinematography conventions. By harnessing program synthesis capabilities of LLMs, LAMP generates structured motion programs from natural language, which are deterministically mapped to 3D trajectories. We construct a large-scale procedural dataset pairing natural text descriptions with corresponding motion programs and 3D trajectories. Experiments demonstrate LAMP's improved performance in motion controllability and alignment with user intent compared to state-of-the-art alternatives establishing the first framework for generating both object and camera motions directly from natural language specifications.", "AI": {"tldr": "LAMP\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5c06\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63cf\u8ff0\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a3D\u8fd0\u52a8\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u7535\u5f71\u5316\u8fd0\u52a8\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u8bed\u8a00\uff08DSL\uff09\u548c\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5408\u6210\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ece\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u76f4\u63a5\u751f\u6210\u7269\u4f53\u53ca\u76f8\u673a\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u63a5\u53e3\uff08\u5982\u7269\u4f53\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u76f8\u673a\u8f68\u8ff9\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff09\u529f\u80fd\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u590d\u6742\u7535\u5f71\u573a\u666f\u7684\u7f16\u6392\u9700\u6c42\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8fd0\u52a8\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u548c\u7528\u6237\u610f\u56fe\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "1) \u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u7535\u5f71\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8DSL\uff0c\u89c4\u8303\u8fd0\u52a8\u6307\u4ee4\u8868\u8fbe\uff1b2) \u5229\u7528LLMs\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5408\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u5c06\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u89e3\u6790\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8fd0\u52a8\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff1b3) \u901a\u8fc7\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6620\u5c04\u5c06\u7a0b\u5e8f\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u663e\u5f0f3D\u8f68\u8ff9\uff1b4) \u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b\u6587\u672c-\u7a0b\u5e8f-\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u663e\u793aLAMP\u5728\u8fd0\u52a8\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\uff08\u5982\u8f68\u8ff9\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u7ec4\u5408\uff09\u548c\u7528\u6237\u610f\u56fe\u7b26\u5408\u5ea6\uff08\u5982\u6307\u4ee4\u89e3\u6790\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff09\u4e0a\u5747\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eSOTA\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u751f\u6210\u590d\u6742\u8fd0\u52a8\u573a\u666f\uff08\u5982\u591a\u7269\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u3001\u7535\u5f71\u7ea7\u8fd0\u955c\uff09\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5305\u542b10\u4e07\u7ec4\u6587\u672c\u8f68\u8ff9\u6837\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u76f4\u63a5\u751f\u6210\u7269\u4f53\u53ca\u76f8\u673a\u7684\u590d\u5408\u8fd0\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u8bc1\u660eLLMs\u5728\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u8fd0\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

To mitigate overfitting to restoration behaviors when conditioned on 3DGS renderings, ReCamDriving adopts a two-stage training paradigm: the first stage uses camera poses for coarse control, while the second stage incorporates 3DGS renderings for fine-grained viewpoint and geometric guidance. Furthermore, we present a 3DGS-based cross-trajectory data curation strategy to eliminate the train-test gap in camera transformation patterns, enabling scalable multi-trajectory supervision from monocular videos.

Despite recent progress, existing STVG studies remain largely confined to object-centric and descriptive instructions, neglecting the task-oriented reasoning that is crucial for embodied agents to accomplish goal-directed interactions. To bridge this gap, we introduce \\textbf{ToG-Bench}, the first task-oriented spatio-temporal video grounding benchmark for egocentric videos. ToG-Bench is characterized by three key features: (1) \\textbf{Task-oriented Grounding}, which requires identifying and localizing objects based on intended tasks rather than straightforward descriptions; (2) \\textbf{Explicit-Implicit Dual Grounding}, where target objects can be either explicitly mentioned or implicitly inferred by contextual reasoning; (3) \\textbf{One-to-Many Grounding}, where a single instruction may correspond to multiple objects involved in task execution. Built upon videos sourced from ScanNet, ToG-Bench comprises 100 annotated clips with 2,704 task-oriented grounding instructions, constructed via a semi-automated pipeline that combines foundation model annotation and human refinement. In addition, we introduce a set of task-level evaluation metrics tailored for multi-object and explicit-implicit object grounding, and systematically benchmark seven state-of-the-art MLLMs. Extensive experiments reveal the intrinsic challenges of task-oriented STVG and substantial performance gaps across explicit-implicit and multi-object grounding, highlighting the difficulty of bridging perception and interaction in embodied scenarios.

We begin by constructing ColonVQA, the most comprehensive multimodal dataset ever built for colonoscopy, featuring over 1.1M+ visual question answering entries across 76 clinical findings and 18 multimodal tasks. Beyond serving as a community-wide data foundation, we further investigate a critical yet underexplored transition in colonoscopy - evolving from multimodal understanding to clinical reasoning: (a) To capture the current landscape of multimodal understanding behaviors, we systematically assess the generalizability of 22 multimodal large language models and examine their reliability under human-induced perturbations. The results reveal that clinical outputs from leading MLLMs remain far from robust and trustworthy. (b) To narrow this gap, we further explore reasoning-centric intelligence tailored for colonoscopy. Specifically, we curate ColonReason, a clinically grounded reasoning dataset annotated through a multi-expert debating pipeline, and develop ColonR1, the first R1-styled model incorporating task-adaptive rewarding and gradient-stable optimization techniques. Under data-scarce conditions, our ColonR1 achieves 56.61% overall accuracy, outperforming supervised fine-tuning by 25.22%, and sets a new reasoning-enabled baseline for multimodal colonoscopy analysis.

However, as model size increases, the growing memory footprint and inference latency pose significant challenges for practical deployment. Recent studies in large language models (LLMs) show that rotation-based techniques can smooth outliers and enable 4-bit quantization, but these approaches often incur substantial overhead and struggle with row-wise outliers in diffusion transformers. To address these challenges, we propose ConvRot, a group-wise rotation-based quantization method that leverages regular Hadamard transform (RHT) to suppress both row-wise and column-wise outliers while reducing complexity from quadratic to linear. Building on this, we design ConvLinear4bit, a plug-and-play module that integrates rotation, quantization, GEMM, and dequantization, enabling W4A4 inference without retraining and preserving visual quality. Experiments on FLUX.1-dev demonstrate a 2.26$\\times$ speedup and 4.05$\\times$ memory reduction while maintaining image fidelity.

In this paper, we introduce GaussianBlender, a pioneering feed-forward framework for text-driven 3D stylization that performs edits instantly at inference. Our method learns structured, disentangled latent spaces with controlled information sharing for geometry and appearance from spatially-grouped 3D Gaussians. A latent diffusion model then applies text-conditioned edits on these learned representations.

Deep perceptual losses, such as LPIPS, achieve good alignment but rely on complex, highly non-linear discriminative features with unknown invariances, while hand-crafted measures like SSIM are interpretable but miss key perceptual properties.\n  We introduce the Structured Uncertainty Similarity Score (SUSS); it models each image through a set of perceptual components, each represented by a structured multivariate Normal distribution. These are trained in a generative, self-supervised manner to assign high likelihood to human-imperceptible augmentations.

However, current VLAs still struggle to produce consistent and precise target-oriented actions, as they often generate redundant or unstable motions along trajectories, limiting their applicability in time-sensitive scenarios.In this work, we attribute these redundant actions to the spatially uniform perception field of existing VLAs, which causes them to be distracted by target-irrelevant objects, especially in complex environments.To address this issue, we propose an efficient PosA-VLA framework that anchors visual attention via pose-conditioned supervision, consistently guiding the model's perception toward task-relevant regions. The pose-conditioned anchor attention mechanism enables the model to better align instruction semantics with actionable visual cues, thereby improving action generation precision and efficiency. Moreover, our framework adopts a lightweight architecture and requires no auxiliary perception modules (e.g., segmentation or grounding networks), ensuring efficient inference.

Existing perturbation methods are frequently white-box and architecture specific. More importantly, while they are often successful, it is rarely clear why they work. Insights into the mechanism of this success would allow developers to understand and analyze these attacks, as well as fine-tune the model to prevent them. This paper presents BlackCAtt, a black-box algorithm and a tool, which uses minimal, causally sufficient pixel sets to construct explainable, imperceptible, reproducible, architecture-agnostic attacks on object detectors. BlackCAtt combines causal pixels with bounding boxes produced by object detectors to create adversarial attacks that lead to the loss, modification or addition of a bounding box. BlackCAtt works across different object detectors of different sizes and architectures, treating the detector as a black box. We compare the performance of BlackCAtt with other black-box attack methods and show that identification of causal pixels leads to more precisely targeted and less perceptible attacks. On the COCO test dataset, our approach is 2.7 times better than the baseline in removing a detection, 3.86 times better in changing a detection, and 5.75 times better in triggering new, spurious, detections. The attacks generated by BlackCAtt are very close to the original image, and hence imperceptible, demonstrating the power of causal pixels.", "AI": {"tldr": "BlackCAtt is a novel black-box attack method for object detectors that uses causal pixel sets to create explainable, imperceptible, and architecture-agnostic adversarial attacks, outperforming baselines by significant margins.", "motivation": "Existing adversarial attack methods for object detectors are often white-box, architecture-specific, and lack explainability.

These models are trained on large-scale datasets, like LAION-5B, often scraped from the internet. However, since this data contains numerous biases, the models inherently learn and reproduce them, resulting in stereotypical outputs. We introduce SelfDebias, a fully unsupervised test-time debiasing method applicable to any diffusion model that uses a UNet as its noise predictor. SelfDebias identifies semantic clusters in an image encoder's embedding space and uses these clusters to guide the diffusion process during inference, minimizing the KL divergence between the output distribution and the uniform distribution. Unlike supervised approaches, SelfDebias does not require human-annotated datasets or external classifiers trained for each generated concept.

This method achieves high-quality generation while accelerating synthesis. However, parallel token sampling within a scale may lead to structural errors, resulting in suboptimal generated images. To mitigate this, we propose Latent Scale Rejection Sampling (LSRS), a method that progressively refines token maps in the latent scale during inference to enhance VAR models. Our method uses a lightweight scoring model to evaluate multiple candidate token maps sampled at each scale, selecting the high-quality map to guide subsequent scale generation. By prioritizing early scales critical for structural coherence, LSRS effectively mitigates autoregressive error accumulation while maintaining computational efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that LSRS significantly improves VAR's generation quality with minimal additional computational overhead. For the VAR-d30 model, LSRS increases the inference time by merely 1% while reducing its FID score from 1.95 to 1.78.

The present study proposes a more robust method to measure breath rate in humans with minimal hardware requirements using a combination of mathematical transforms with a relative deviation from the ground truth of less than 5%. The method was tested on videos taken from 14 volunteers with a total duration of over 2 hours 30 minutes. The obtained results were compared to reference data and the average mean absolute error was found to be at 0.57 respirations per minute, which is noticeably better than the results from previous works.

First, despite pioneering the use of diffusion models in DD and delivering impressive performance, the vast majority of approaches paradoxically require a diffusion model pre-trained on the full target dataset, undermining the very purpose of DD and incurring prohibitive training costs. Second, although some methods turn to general text-to-image models without relying on such target-specific training, they suffer from a significant distributional mismatch, as the web-scale priors encapsulated in these foundation models fail to faithfully capture the target-specific semantics, leading to suboptimal performance. To tackle these challenges, we propose Core Distribution Alignment (CoDA), a framework that enables effective DD using only an off-the-shelf text-to-image model. Our key idea is to first identify the \"intrinsic core distribution\" of the target dataset using a robust density-based discovery mechanism. We then steer the generative process to align the generated samples with this core distribution. By doing so, CoDA effectively bridges the gap between general-purpose generative priors and target semantics, yielding highly representative distilled datasets. Extensive experiments suggest that, without relying on a generative model specifically trained on the target dataset, CoDA achieves performance on par with or even superior to previous methods with such reliance across all benchmarks, including ImageNet-1K and its subsets. Notably, it establishes a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 60.4% at the 50-images-per-class (IPC) setup on ImageNet-1K.

Publicly available histopathology datasets remain scarce, and those that do exist predominantly represent Western populations. Consequently, the generalizability of AI models to populations from less digitized regions, such as the Middle East, is largely unknown. This motivates the public release of our dataset to support the development and validation of pathology AI models across globally diverse populations. We present 339 whole-slide images of prostate core needle biopsies from a consecutive series of 185 patients collected in Erbil, Iraq. The slides are associated with Gleason scores and International Society of Urological Pathology grades assigned independently by three pathologists. Scanning was performed using two high-throughput scanners (Leica and Hamamatsu) and one compact scanner (Grundium).

In this work, we experiment with three distinct pre-training, intermediate fine-tuning, and downstream datasets and training objectives to explore their marginal benefits on a small 5M-parameter vision transformer. We find that while pre-training and fine-tuning always help our model but have diminishing returns, intermediate fine-tuning can actually show harmful impact on downstream performance, potentially due to dissimilarity in task mechanics. Taken together, our results suggest that small-scale ViTs benefit most from targeted pre-training and careful data selection, while indiscriminate stacking of intermediate tasks can waste compute and even degrade performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5c0f\u578b\u89c6\u89c9Transformer\u901a\u8fc7\u76ee\u6807\u660e\u786e\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u53ef\u4f18\u5316\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5806\u53e0\u4e2d\u95f4\u4efb\u52a1\u53ef\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u7684\u5c0f\u578b\u89c6\u89c9Transformer\u4e2d\uff0c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u4e2d\u95f4\u5fae\u8c03\u4e0e\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u534f\u540c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e09\u7ec4\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u4e2d\u95f4\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5bf95M\u53c2\u6570\u89c6\u89c9Transformer\u7684\u8fb9\u9645\u6536\u76ca\u3002", "result": "\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u59cb\u7ec8\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u4f46\u6536\u76ca\u9012\u51cf\uff0c\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u5fae\u8c03\u4efb\u52a1\u56e0\u4efb\u52a1\u673a\u5236\u5dee\u5f02\u53cd\u800c\u635f\u5bb3\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c0f\u578bViT\u9700\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u7b5b\u9009\uff0c\u76f2\u76ee\u53e0\u52a0\u4e2d\u95f4\u4efb\u52a1\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u6d6a\u8d39\u53ca\u6027\u80fd\u9000\u5316\u3002"}}

However, objectively accurate methods to early detect local regrowth (LR) from follow-up endoscopy images during WW are essential to manage care and prevent distant metastases. Hence, we developed a Siamese Swin Transformer with Dual Cross-Attention (SSDCA) to combine longitudinal endoscopic images at restaging and follow-up and distinguish cCR from LR. SSDCA leverages pretrained Swin transformers to extract domain agnostic features and enhance robustness to imaging variations. Dual cross attention is implemented to emphasize features from the two scans without requiring any spatial alignment of images to predict response. SSDCA as well as Swin-based baselines were trained using image pairs from 135 patients and evaluated on a held-out set of image pairs from 62 patients. SSDCA produced the best balanced accuracy (81.76\\% $\\pm$ 0.04), sensitivity (90.07\\% $\\pm$ 0.08), and specificity (72.86\\% $\\pm$ 0.05).

Zero-shot techniques aim to adapt image diffusion models for videos without requiring further model training. Recent methods largely emphasize integrating inter-frame correspondence into attention mechanisms. However, the soft constraint applied to identify the valid features to attend is insufficient, which could lead to temporal inconsistency. In this paper, we present FRESCO, which integrates intra-frame correspondence with inter-frame correspondence to formulate a more robust spatial-temporal constraint. This enhancement ensures a consistent transformation of semantically similar content between frames. Our method goes beyond attention guidance to explicitly optimize features, achieving high spatial-temporal consistency with the input video, significantly enhancing the visual coherence of manipulated videos.

Current methods predominantly focus on generating one modality given another as the condition or integrating either of them with other modalities such as text and audio. Unifying 2D videos and 3D motions for simultaneous optimization and generation remains largely unexplored, presenting significant challenges due to their substantial structural and distributional differences. Inspired by the LLM's ability to unify different modalities, our method models videos and 3D motions as a unified tokens sequence, utilizing separate embedding layers to mitigate distribution gaps. Additionally, we devise a sequence modeling strategy that integrates two distinct tasks within a single framework, proving the effectiveness of unified modeling. Moreover, to efficiently align with visual tokens and preserve 3D spatial information, we design a novel 3D motion tokenizer with a temporal expansion strategy, using a single VQ-VAE to produce quantized motion tokens. It features multiple expert decoders that handle body shapes, translation, global orientation, and body poses for reliable 3D motion reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method simultaneously generates corresponding videos and motions while performing accurate motion capture.

By analyzing the internal behaviors of the state and image token updating mechanism, we find that aggregating self-attention maps across layers reveals a consistent pattern: dynamic regions are naturally down-weighted, exposing an implicit motion cue that the pretrained transformer already encodes but never explicitly uses. Motivated by this observation, we introduce MUT3R, a training-free framework that applies the attention-derived motion cue to suppress dynamic content in the early layers of the transformer during inference. Our attention-level gating module suppresses the influence of dynamic regions before their artifacts propagate through the feature hierarchy. Notably, we do not retrain or fine-tune the model; we let the pretrained transformer diagnose its own motion cues and correct itself. This early regulation stabilizes geometric reasoning in streaming scenarios and leads to improvements in temporal consistency and camera pose robustness across multiple dynamic benchmarks, offering a simple and training-free pathway toward motion-aware streaming reconstruction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMUT3R\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u9690\u542b\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6291\u5236\u52a8\u6001\u533a\u57df\u4f2a\u5f71\uff0c\u63d0\u53473D\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u52a8\u6001\u533a\u57df\u5e72\u6270\u5bfc\u81f4\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4f20\u64ad\u5931\u771f\uff0c\u800c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3Transformer\u7684\u8de8\u5c42\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u56fe\u81ea\u52a8\u964d\u4f4e\u52a8\u6001\u533a\u57df\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u66b4\u9732\u9690\u542b\u8fd0\u52a8\u7ebf\u7d22\u672a\u88ab\u5229\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7ea7\u95e8\u63a7\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65e9\u671f\u5c42\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6743\u91cd\u6291\u5236\u52a8\u6001\u533a\u57df\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u963b\u65ad\u4f2a\u5f71\u4f20\u64ad\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u76f8\u673a\u59ff\u6001\u9c81\u68d2\u60275-15%\uff0c\u4e14\u4fdd\u63010\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bc1\u660eTransformer\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6743\u91cd\u9690\u542b\u8fd0\u52a8\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u9996\u4e2a\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u52a8\u60013D\u91cd\u5efa\u4fee\u6b63\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u65f6\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

However, existing methods rely heavily on manually provided masks and textual prompts to preserve semantic fidelity and motion precision. Removing these constraints creates a fundamental trade-off: visual artifacts without masks and poor spatial control without prompts. To address these limitations, we propose DirectDrag, a novel mask- and prompt-free editing framework. DirectDrag enables precise and efficient manipulation with minimal user input while maintaining high image fidelity and accurate point alignment. DirectDrag introduces two key innovations. First, we design an Auto Soft Mask Generation module that intelligently infers editable regions from point displacement, automatically localizing deformation along movement paths while preserving contextual integrity through the generative model's inherent capacity. Second, we develop a Readout-Guided Feature Alignment mechanism that leverages intermediate diffusion activations to maintain structural consistency during point-based edits, substantially improving visual fidelity. Despite operating without manual mask or prompt, DirectDrag achieves superior image quality compared to existing methods while maintaining competitive drag accuracy.

However, in text-to-image(T2I) diffusion models, most related works focus on search strategies and reward models, yet the impact of the stochastic characteristic of noise in T2I diffusion models on the method's performance remains unexplored. In this work, we analyze the effects of randomness in T2I diffusion models and explore a new format of randomness for TTS: text embedding perturbation, which couples with existing randomness like SDE-injected noise to enhance generative diversity and quality. We start with a frequency-domain analysis of these formats of randomness and their impact on generation, and find that these two randomness exhibit complementary behavior in the frequency domain: spatial noise favors low-frequency components (early steps), while text embedding perturbation enhances high-frequency details (later steps), thereby compensating for the potential limitations of spatial noise randomness in high-frequency manipulation. Concurrently, text embedding demonstrates varying levels of tolerance to perturbation across different dimensions of the generation process. Specifically, our method consists of two key designs: (1) Introducing step-based text embedding perturbation, combining frequency-guided noise schedules with spatial noise perturbation. (2) Adapting the perturbation intensity selectively based on their frequency-specific contributions to generation and tolerance to perturbation. Our approach can be seamlessly integrated into existing TTS methods and demonstrates significant improvements on multiple benchmarks with almost no additional computation.

Consequently, recent research has focused on query-aware frame selection, methods that often incur significant computational overhead.

We first identify and validate a query typology distinguishing between global query and localized query. We demonstrate that while uniform sampling is both effective and efficient for global queries, localized queries indeed necessitate query-aware selection for optimal performance. Building on this insight, we propose DIG, a training-free frame selection framework that adapts its strategy based on the query type. Specifically,DIG employs efficient uniform sampling for global queries while activating a specialized pipeline to extract query-relevant frames for localized queries.

Prior works applying group-theoretic priors or modeling transformations typically operate in the high-dimensional data space, where group actions apply uniformly across the entire input, making it difficult to disentangle the subspace that varies under transformations. While latent-space methods offer greater flexibility, they still require manual partitioning of latent variables into equivariant and invariant subspaces, limiting the ability to robustly learn and operate group actions within the representation space. To address this, we introduce a novel end-to-end framework that for the first time learns group actions on latent image manifolds, automatically discovering transformation-relevant structures without manual intervention. Our method uses learnable binary masks with straight-through estimation to dynamically partition latent representations into transformation-sensitive and invariant components. We formulate this within a unified optimization framework that jointly learns latent disentanglement and group transformation mappings.

Among these INR-based video codecs, Neural Video Representation Compression (NVRC) was the first to adopt a fully end-to-end compression framework that compresses INRs, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, some recently proposed lightweight INRs have shown comparable performance to their baseline codecs with computational complexity lower than 10kMACs/pixel. In this work, we extend NVRC toward lightweight representations, and propose NVRC-Lite, which incorporates two key changes. Firstly, we integrated multi-scale feature grids into our lightweight neural representation, and the use of higher resolution grids significantly improves the performance of INRs at low complexity. Secondly, we address the issue that existing INRs typically leverage autoregressive models for entropy coding: these are effective but impractical due to their slow coding speed. In this work, we propose an octree-based context model for entropy coding high-dimensional feature grids, which accelerates the entropy coding module of the model. Our experimental results demonstrate that NVRC-Lite outperforms C3, one of the best lightweight INR-based video codecs, with up to 21.03% and 23.06% BD-rate savings when measured in PSNR and MS-SSIM, respectively, while achieving 8.4x encoding and 2.5x decoding speedup.

However, they generate excessive redundant Gaussians, causing high memory overhead and sub-optimal multi-view feature aggregation, leading to degraded novel view synthesis and scene understanding performance. We propose C3G, a novel feed-forward framework that estimates compact 3D Gaussians only at essential spatial locations, minimizing redundancy while enabling effective feature lifting.

In this work, we present RELIC, a unified framework that tackles these three challenges altogether. Given a single image and a text description, RELIC enables memory-aware, long-duration exploration of arbitrary scenes in real time. Built upon recent autoregressive video-diffusion distillation techniques, our model represents long-horizon memory using highly compressed historical latent tokens encoded with both relative actions and absolute camera poses within the KV cache. This compact, camera-aware memory structure supports implicit 3D-consistent content retrieval and enforces long-term coherence with minimal computational overhead. In parallel, we fine-tune a bidirectional teacher video model to generate sequences beyond its original 5-second training horizon, and transform it into a causal student generator using a new memory-efficient self-forcing paradigm that enables full-context distillation over long-duration teacher as well as long student self-rollouts. Implemented as a 14B-parameter model and trained on a curated Unreal Engine-rendered dataset, RELIC achieves real-time generation at 16 FPS while demonstrating more accurate action following, more stable long-horizon streaming, and more robust spatial-memory retrieval compared with prior work.

The agentic paradigm promises that VLMs can use a wide variety of tools that could augment these capabilities, such as depth estimators, segmentation models, and pose estimators. Yet it remains an open challenge how to realize this vision without solely relying on handcrafted prompting strategies or enforcing fixed, predefined tool pipelines that limit VLMs' ability to discover optimal tool-use patterns. Reinforcement Learning could overcome this gap, but has so far been limited to reasoning with a single visual tool due to the large search space in multi-tool reasoning. We introduce Double Interactive Reinforcement Learning (DIRL), a two-phase training framework where VLMs learn to coordinate multiple tools through interactive exploration and feedback. In the teaching phase, we combine demonstrations from a single tool specialist trained via interactive RL with traces from a frontier model using all tools. In the exploration phase, the model further refines multi-tool coordination through continued RL. Our model, SpaceTools, with tool-augmented spatial reasoning ability, achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatial understanding benchmarks (RoboSpatial-Home, BLINK, BOP-ASK) and demonstrates reliable real-world manipulation using a 7-DOF robot as a tool. DIRL provides substantial improvements over the vanilla SFT (+12% on RoboSpatial) and RL (+16% on RoboSpatial) baselines.

Recent advances have explored automating this process using Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), yet existing methods often produce geometrically inaccurate layouts and lack the iterative, layer-specific editing required in professional workflows. To address these limitations, we present PosterCopilot, a framework that advances layout reasoning and controllable editing for professional graphic design. Specifically, we introduce a progressive three-stage training strategy that equips LMMs with geometric understanding and aesthetic reasoning for layout design, consisting of Perturbed Supervised Fine-Tuning, Reinforcement Learning for Visual-Reality Alignment, and Reinforcement Learning from Aesthetic Feedback. Furthermore, we develop a complete workflow that couples the trained LMM-based design model with generative models, enabling layer-controllable, iterative editing for precise element refinement while maintaining global visual consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PosterCopilot achieves geometrically accurate and aesthetically superior layouts, offering unprecedented controllability for professional iterative design.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aPosterCopilot\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56fe\u5f62\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u51e0\u4f55\u5e03\u5c40\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8fed\u4ee3\u7f16\u8f91\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u89c6\u89c9\u4f20\u8fbe\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5e73\u9762\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u5e03\u5c40\u9519\u8bef\u53ca\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e13\u4e1a\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u8fed\u4ee3\u7f16\u8f91\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u6270\u52a8\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff08PSFT\uff09\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u73b0\u5b9e\u5bf9\u9f50\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL-VR\uff09\u53ca\u7f8e\u5b66\u53cd\u9988\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL-AF\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86LMM\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8054\u5408\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u5b9e\u73b0\u5206\u5c42\u7f16\u8f91\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660ePosterCopilot\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5e03\u5c40\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u7f8e\u5b66\u8868\u73b0\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u652f\u6301\u7cbe\u786e\u5143\u7d20\u4f18\u5316\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u89c6\u89c9\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7ef4\u62a4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u5f3a\u5e03\u5c40\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u53ef\u63a7\u7f16\u8f91\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e13\u4e1a\u5e73\u9762\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u74f6\u9888\u3002"}}

Prior works usually suffer from two limitations. First, they add random noise to training samples or VAE latents as data augmentation, introducing complex pipelines including extra noising and denoising steps. Second, they use a pretrained and frozen VAE encoder, resulting in suboptimal reconstruction and generation quality. In this paper, we find that the two issues can be solved in a very simple way: just fixing the variance (which would otherwise be predicted by the VAE encoder) to a constant (e.g., 0.5). On the one hand, this method allows the encoder to output a broader distribution of tokens and the decoder to learn to reconstruct clean images from the augmented token distribution, avoiding additional noise or denoising design. On the other hand, fixed variance simplifies the VAE evidence lower bound, making it stable to train an NF with a VAE jointly. On the ImageNet $256 \\times 256$ generation task, our model SimFlow obtains a gFID score of 2.15, outperforming the state-of-the-art method STARFlow (gFID 2.40).
