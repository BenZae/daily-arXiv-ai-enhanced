While recent VLMs achieve strong scene-level reasoning across a range of visual tasks, there exists no benchmark that systematically evaluates or trains them for gaze interpretation, leaving open the question of whether gaze understanding can emerge from general-purpose vision-language pre-training. To address this gap, we introduce VL4Gaze, the first large-scale benchmark designed to investigate, evaluate, and unlock the potential of VLMs for gaze understanding. VL4Gaze contains 489K automatically generated question-answer pairs across 124K images and formulates gaze understanding as a unified VQA problem through four complementary tasks: (1) gaze object description, (2) gaze direction description, (3) gaze point location, and (4) ambiguous question recognition. We comprehensively evaluate both commercial and open-source VLMs under in-context learning and fine-tuning settings. The results show that even large-scale VLMs struggle to reliably infer gaze semantics and spatial localization without task-specific supervision. In contrast, training on VL4Gaze brings substantial and consistent improvements across all tasks, highlighting the importance of targeted multi-task supervision for developing gaze understanding capabilities in VLMs. We will release the dataset and code to support further research and development in this direction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86VL4Gaze\u2014\u2014\u9996\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u5bf9\u6ce8\u89c6\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002 VL4Gaze\u5305\u542b489K\u4e2a\u95ee\u7b54\u5bf9\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u56db\u5927\u4efb\u52a1\uff1a\u6ce8\u89c6\u7269\u4f53\u63cf\u8ff0\u3001\u6ce8\u89c6\u65b9\u5411\u63cf\u8ff0\u3001\u6ce8\u89c6\u70b9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u6a21\u7cca\u95ee\u9898\u8bc6\u522b\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u76d1\u7763\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9488\u5bf9\u6ce8\u89c6\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e14\u672a\u77e5\u901a\u7528\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u80fd\u5426\u81ea\u53d1\u4ea7\u751f\u6ce8\u89c6\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b124K\u56fe\u50cf\u3001489K\u81ea\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u95ee\u7b54\u5bf9\u7684VL4Gaze\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u56db\u5927\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u4e3b\u6d41VLM\u5728\u65e0\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u76d1\u7763\u65f6\u96be\u4ee5\u53ef\u9760\u63a8\u7406\u6ce8\u89c6\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff1b\u5f15\u5165VL4Gaze\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u5404\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u5747\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u76d1\u7763\u624d\u80fd\u53d1\u5c55\u6ce8\u89c6\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u56e2\u961f\u627f\u8bfa\u5f00\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0e\u4ee3\u7801\u63a8\u52a8\u540e\u7eed\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

Although SSC has been widely studied in terrestrial domains such as autonomous driving, aerial scenarios like autonomous flying remain largely unexplored, thereby limiting progress on downstream applications. Furthermore, LiDAR sensors represent the primary modality for SSC data generation, which poses challenges for most uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) due to flight regulations, mass and energy constraints, and the sparsity of LiDAR-based point clouds from elevated viewpoints. To address these limitations, we introduce OccuFly, the first real-world, camera-based aerial SSC benchmark, captured at altitudes of 50m, 40m, and 30m during spring, summer, fall, and winter. OccuFly covers urban, industrial, and rural scenarios, provides 22 semantic classes, and the data format adheres to established conventions to facilitate seamless integration with existing research. Crucially, we propose a LiDAR-free data generation framework based on camera modality, which is ubiquitous on modern UAVs. By utilizing traditional 3D reconstruction, our framework automates label transfer by lifting a subset of annotated 2D masks into the reconstructed point cloud, thereby substantially minimizing manual 3D annotation effort.

Y. Chan"], "title": "Uncovering Competency Gaps in Large Language Models and Their Benchmarks", "comment": null, "summary": "The evaluation of large language models (LLMs) relies heavily on standardized benchmarks. These benchmarks provide useful aggregated metrics for a given capability, but those aggregated metrics can obscure (i) particular sub-areas where the LLMs are weak (\"model gaps\") and (ii) imbalanced coverage in the benchmarks themselves (\"benchmark gaps\"). We propose a new method that uses sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to automatically uncover both types of gaps. By extracting SAE concept activations and computing saliency-weighted performance scores across benchmark data, the method grounds evaluation in the model's internal representations and enables comparison across benchmarks. As examples demonstrating our approach, we applied the method to two popular open-source models and ten benchmarks. We found that these models consistently underperformed on concepts that stand in contrast to sycophantic behaviors (e.g., politely refusing a request or asserting boundaries) and concepts connected to safety discussions. These model gaps align with observations previously surfaced in the literature; our automated, unsupervised method was able to recover them without manual supervision. We also observed benchmark gaps: many of the evaluated benchmarks over-represented concepts related to obedience, authority, or instruction-following, while missing core concepts that should fall within their intended scope. In sum, our method offers a representation-grounded approach to evaluation, enabling concept-level decomposition of benchmark scores. Rather than replacing conventional aggregated metrics, CG complements them by providing a concept-level decomposition that can reveal why a model scored as it did and how benchmarks could evolve to better reflect their intended scope.

This separation discards information during demosaicing, denoising, or quantization, while forcing models to adapt to sensor artifacts. We present a task-driven co-design framework that unifies optics, sensor modeling, and lightweight semantic segmentation networks into a single end-to-end RAW-to-task pipeline. Building on DeepLens[19], our system integrates realistic cellphone-scale lens models, learnable color filter arrays, Poisson-Gaussian noise processes, and quantization, all optimized directly for segmentation objectives. Evaluations on KITTI-360 show consistent mIoU improvements over fixed pipelines, with optics modeling and CFA learning providing the largest gains, especially for thin or low-light-sensitive classes. Importantly, these robustness gains are achieved with a compact ~1M-parameter model running at ~28 FPS, demonstrating edge deployability. Visual and quantitative analyses further highlight how co-designed sensors adapt acquisition to semantic structure, sharpening boundaries and maintaining accuracy under blur, noise, and low bit-depth.

We introduce SA-DiffuSeq, a diffusion framework that integrates sparse attention to fundamentally improve scalability for long document modeling. By selectively allocating attention within the diffusion process, SA-DiffuSeq significantly reduces computational complexity while maintaining semantic coherence and generation quality. A key component of our method is a soft absorbing state tailored to sparse attention dynamics, which stabilizes diffusion trajectories and accelerates sequence reconstruction. This design improves sampling efficiency and enhances precision in long range dependency modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SA-DiffuSeq consistently surpasses state of the art diffusion baselines in both training efficiency and sampling speed, with especially strong gains on extended sequences. These properties make SA-DiffuSeq well suited for demanding long form applications such as scientific writing, large scale code generation, and multi turn long context dialogue.

Together, TokSuite allows robust decoupling of the influence of a model's tokenizer, supporting a series of novel findings that elucidate the respective benefits and shortcomings of a wide range of popular tokenizers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faTokSuite\u5de5\u5177\u96c6\u4e0e\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u5bf9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u5f71\u54cd", "motivation": "\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u5bf9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u6e05\u6670\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u56e0\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u9694\u79bb\u5176\u72ec\u7acb\u4f5c\u7528", "method": "\u8bad\u7ec314\u7ec4\u5b8c\u5168\u540c\u6784\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u4ec5\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u4e0d\u540c\uff09\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b\u73b0\u5b9e\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793aBPE\u3001\u5b57\u8282\u5bf9\u7b49\u4e3b\u6d41\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u5728\u957f\u6587\u672c\u5904\u7406\u3001OOV\u5904\u7406\u7b49\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02", "conclusion": "TokSuite\u4e3a\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u51b3\u7b56\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5206\u8bcd\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b"}}

While recent architectures such as FastVLM improve efficiency through optimized vision encoders, existing pipelines still rely on static visual preprocessing, leading to redundant computation for visually simple inputs. In this work, we propose an adaptive visual preprocessing method that dynamically adjusts input resolution and spatial coverage based on image content characteristics. The proposed approach combines content-aware image analysis, adaptive resolution selection, and content-aware cropping to reduce visual redundancy prior to vision encoding. Importantly, the method is integrated with FastVLM without modifying its architecture or requiring retraining. We evaluate the proposed method on a subset of the DocVQA dataset in an inference-only setting, focusing on efficiency-oriented metrics. Experimental results show that adaptive preprocessing reduces per-image inference time by over 50\\%, lowers mean full generation time, and achieves a consistent reduction of more than 55\\% in visual token count compared to the baseline pipeline. These findings demonstrate that input-aware preprocessing is an effective and lightweight strategy for improving deployment-oriented efficiency of vision-language models.

A key property of effective simulators is their ability to expose failure modes of the systems they evaluate. We present an adversarial training framework that iteratively improves user simulator realism through a competitive dynamic between a generator (user simulator) and a discriminator. Applied to mental health support chatbots, our approach demonstrates that fine-tuned simulators dramatically outperform zero-shot base models at surfacing system issues, and adversarial training further enhances diversity, distributional alignment, and predictive validity. The resulting simulator achieves a strong correlation between simulated and real failure occurrence rates across diverse chatbot configurations while maintaining low distributional divergence of failure modes. Discriminator accuracy decreases drastically after three adversarial iterations, suggesting improved realism. These results provide evidence that adversarial training is a promising approach for creating realistic user simulators in mental health support TOD domains, enabling rapid, reliable, and cost-effective system evaluation before deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u5347\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7528\u6237\u6a21\u62df\u5668\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6548\u679c", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7528\u6237\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u96be\u4ee5\u771f\u5b9e\u590d\u73b0\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u66b4\u9732\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u7f3a\u9677", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u751f\u6210\u5668-\u5224\u522b\u5668\u5bf9\u6297\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u8bad\u7ec3\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u6709\u6548\u6027", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u6a21\u62df\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u7cfb\u7edf\u5931\u6548\u6a21\u5f0f\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff08p<0.01\uff09\uff0c\u5224\u522b\u5668\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4ece85%\u964d\u81f332%\uff0c\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\u5206\u5e03\u5dee\u5f02\u51cf\u5c1167%", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ef\u521b\u5efa\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u7528\u6237\u6a21\u62df\u5668\uff0c\u4f7f\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u90e8\u7f72\u524d\u5b9e\u73b0\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u9ad8\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1"}}

We examine this question using a controlled, turn-level comparison in which expert human tutors, novice human tutors, and multiple large language models respond to the same set of math remediation conversation turns. We examine both instructional strategies and linguistic characteristics of tutoring responses, including restating and revoicing, pressing for accuracy, lexical diversity, readability, politeness, and agency. We find that large language models approach expert levels of perceived pedagogical quality on average but exhibit systematic differences in their instructional and linguistic profiles. In particular, large language models tend to underuse restating and revoicing strategies characteristic of expert human tutors, while producing longer, more lexically diverse, and more polite responses. Statistical analyses show that restating and revoicing, lexical diversity, and pressing for accuracy are positively associated with perceived pedagogical quality, whereas higher levels of agentic and polite language are negatively associated. Overall, recent large language models exhibit levels of perceived pedagogical quality comparable to expert human tutors, while relying on different instructional and linguistic strategies. These findings underscore the value of analyzing instructional strategies and linguistic characteristics when evaluating tutoring responses across human tutors and intelligent tutoring systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bfc\u5e08\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u8f85\u5bfc\u4e2d\u7684\u6559\u5b66\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0LLM\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u6559\u5b66\u54c1\u8d28\u63a5\u8fd1\u4e13\u5bb6\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740LLM\u5728\u6559\u80b2\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u9700\u660e\u786e\u5176\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u4e13\u5bb6\u5bfc\u5e08\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6559\u5b66\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5982\u590d\u8ff0/\u8ffd\u95ee\uff09\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u5982\u8bcd\u6c47\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3001\u793c\u8c8c\u6027\uff09\u7b49\u7ec6\u8282\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u6536\u96c6\u4e13\u5bb6\u5bfc\u5e08\u3001\u65b0\u624b\u5bfc\u5e08\u53ca\u591a\u4e2aLLM\u5bf9\u76f8\u540c\u6570\u5b66\u8f85\u5bfc\u5bf9\u8bdd\u56de\u5408\u7684\u56de\u590d\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u6559\u5b66\u7b56\u7565\u53ca\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u7edf\u8ba1\u5176\u4e0e\u6559\u5b66\u54c1\u8d28\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "result": "LLM\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u6559\u5b66\u54c1\u8d28\u611f\u77e5\u63a5\u8fd1\u4e13\u5bb6\uff0c\u4f46\u8f83\u5c11\u4f7f\u7528\u590d\u8ff0/\u8ffd\u95ee\u7b49\u4e13\u5bb6\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4e14\u56de\u590d\u66f4\u957f\u3001\u8bcd\u6c47\u66f4\u591a\u6837\u3001\u66f4\u793c\u8c8c\u3002\u7edf\u8ba1\u663e\u793a\u590d\u8ff0/\u8ffd\u95ee\u3001\u8bcd\u6c47\u591a\u6837\u6027\u53ca\u8ffd\u95ee\u4e0e\u6559\u5b66\u54c1\u8d28\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u800c\u9ad8\u4e3b\u52a8\u6027\u53ca\u793c\u8c8c\u6027\u5219\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u867d\u5177\u53ef\u6bd4\u6559\u5b66\u54c1\u8d28\uff0c\u4f46\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0d\u540c\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u8bc4\u4f30\u667a\u80fd\u6559\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u65f6\u9700\u5173\u6ce8\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u8fc7\u5ea6\u793c\u8c8c\u6216\u5197\u957f\u5f71\u54cd\u6559\u5b66\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

First, based on a B/C/D-Scan three-view joint analysis strategy, a three-dimensional pipeline three-view feature evaluation method is established by cross-validating forward simulation results obtained using FDTD methods with actual measurement data. Second, the DCO-YOLO framework is proposed, which integrates DySample, CGLU, and OutlookAttention cross-dimensional correlation mechanisms into the original YOLOv11 algorithm, significantly improving the small-scale pipeline edge feature extraction capability. Furthermore, a 3D-DIoU spatial feature matching algorithm is proposed, which integrates three-dimensional geometric constraints and center distance penalty terms to achieve automated association of multi-view annotations. The three-view fusion strategy resolves inherent ambiguities in single-view detection. Experiments based on real urban underground pipeline data show that the proposed method achieves accuracy, recall, and mean average precision of 96.2%, 93.3%, and 96.7%, respectively, in complex multi-pipeline scenarios, which are 2.0%, 2.1%, and 0.9% higher than the baseline model. Ablation experiments validated the synergistic optimization effect of the dynamic feature enhancement module and Grad-CAM++ heatmap visualization demonstrated that the improved model significantly enhanced its ability to focus on pipeline geometric features. This study integrates deep learning optimization strategies with the physical characteristics of 3D GPR, offering an efficient and reliable novel technical framework for the intelligent recognition and localization of underground pipelines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u57fa\u4e8e3D GPR\u7684\u5730\u4e0b\u7ba1\u7ebf\u68c0\u6d4b\u5b58\u5728\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u7279\u5f81\u5f31\u5173\u8054\u3001\u5c0f\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7ba1\u7ebf\u8bc6\u522b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4f4e\u548c\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd3D\u7ba1\u7ebf\u667a\u80fd\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u89c6\u89d2\u8054\u5408\u5206\u6790\u7b56\u7565\u5efa\u7acb\u7279\u5f81\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u6539\u8fdbYOLOv11\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c3D-DIoU\u5339\u914d\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5f53\u524d\u5730\u4e0b\u7ba1\u7ebf\u68c0\u6d4b\u6280\u672f\u4e2d\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u7279\u5f81\u5173\u8054\u6027\u5f31\u3001\u5c0f\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7ba1\u7ebf\u8bc6\u522b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4f4e\u4ee5\u53ca\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5dee\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3\u57ce\u5e02\u5730\u4e0b\u7ba1\u7ebf\u667a\u80fd\u63a2\u6d4b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "1) \u91c7\u7528B/C/D-Scan\u4e09\u89c6\u89d2\u8054\u5408\u5206\u6790\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u878d\u5408FDTD\u6b63\u6f14\u6a21\u62df\u4e0e\u5b9e\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\uff1b2) \u63d0\u51faDCO-YOLO\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u96c6\u6210DySample\u52a8\u6001\u91c7\u6837\u3001CGLU\u901a\u9053\u95e8\u63a7\u548cOutlookAttention\u8de8\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff1b3) \u5f00\u53d13D-DIoU\u7a7a\u95f4\u5339\u914d\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e09\u7ef4\u51e0\u4f55\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8ddd\u79bb\u60e9\u7f5a\u9879\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u6807\u6ce8\u81ea\u52a8\u5173\u8054\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u590d\u6742\u591a\u7ba1\u7ebf\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8fbe\u523096.2%\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u300193.3%\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u548c96.7%\u5e73\u5747\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u8f83\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u53472.0%\u30012.1%\u548c0.9%\u3002\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u5e94\uff0cGrad-CAM++\u70ed\u529b\u56fe\u663e\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u7ba1\u9053\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5173\u6ce8\u5ea6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u521b\u65b0\u6027\u5730\u878d\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u4e09\u7ef4\u5730\u8d28\u96f7\u8fbe\u7269\u7406\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u5c0f\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7ba1\u7ebf\u8fb9\u7f18\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u7ef4\u51e0\u4f55\u7ea6\u675f\u589e\u5f3a\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u6570\u636e\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u4e3a\u57ce\u5e02\u5730\u4e0b\u7ba1\u7ebf\u667a\u80fd\u8bc6\u522b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6280\u672f\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Using a multi-task evaluation setup where demographics are associated with names, professions, and education levels, we measure whether models can be debiased while preserving demographic detection capabilities. We compare attribution-based and correlation-based methods for locating bias features. We find that targeted sparse autoencoder feature ablations in Gemma-2-9B reduce bias without degrading recognition performance: attribution-based ablations mitigate race and gender profession stereotypes while preserving name recognition accuracy, whereas correlation-based ablations are more effective for education bias. Qualitative analysis further reveals that removing attribution features in education tasks induces ``prior collapse'', thus increasing overall bias. This highlights the need for dimension-specific interventions. Overall, our results show that demographic bias arises from task-specific mechanisms rather than absolute demographic markers, and that mechanistic inference-time interventions can enable surgical debiasing without compromising core model capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u7a76\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u504f\u89c1\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u57fa\u7840\u4eba\u53e3\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5173\u8054\u6027\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u901a\u8fc7\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u7279\u5f81\u5e72\u9884\u53ef\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6d88\u9664\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u6838\u5fc3\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e8\u5728\u5398\u6e05\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u673a\u5236\u662f\u5426\u72ec\u7acb\u4e8e\u57fa\u7840\u4eba\u53e3\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u7cbe\u51c6\u7684\u53bb\u504f\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u529b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6d88\u9664\u7279\u5b9a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u59d3\u540d\u3001\u804c\u4e1a\u3001\u6559\u80b2\u5c42\u7ea7\u7b49\u4eba\u53e3\u5c5e\u6027\u5173\u8054\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f52\u56e0\u5206\u6790\uff08attribution-based\uff09\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff08correlation-based\uff09\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5bf9Gemma-2-9B\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u7279\u5f81\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u5f52\u56e0\u5206\u6790\u6d88\u878d\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u79cd\u65cf\u6027\u522b\u804c\u4e1a\u504f\u89c1\u5e76\u7ef4\u6301\u59d3\u540d\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u800c\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5206\u6790\u66f4\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6559\u80b2\u504f\u89c1\u6d88\u9664\uff1b\u53d1\u73b0\u6559\u80b2\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5f52\u56e0\u7279\u5f81\u79fb\u9664\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u5148\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u584c\u7f29\u4ece\u800c\u589e\u52a0\u6574\u4f53\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u7279\u5f81\u7ef4\u5ea6\u9700\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u5e72\u9884\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63ed\u793a\u4eba\u53e3\u504f\u89c1\u6e90\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u673a\u5236\u800c\u975e\u7edd\u5bf9\u4eba\u53e3\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u673a\u68b0\u5316\u5e72\u9884\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u53bb\u504f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7a00\u758f\u7279\u5f81\u5e72\u9884\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6838\u5fc3\u80fd\u529b\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Mainstream solutions typically rely on explicit modality alignment strategies; however, this paradigm heavily depends on constructing large-scale paired datasets for pre-training. To address this, grounded in the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, we explore the potential of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) in bridging modality gaps. Recognizing the suboptimal performance of existing generic Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods that operate within the weight space, particularly on limited-capacity models, we shift the optimization perspective to the feature space and propose a novel PEFT strategy termed Domain Representation Injection (DRI). Specifically, while keeping the VFM fully frozen to maximize the preservation of general knowledge, we design a lightweight, learnable Offset Encoder to extract domain-specific representations rich in modality and identity attributes from raw inputs. Guided by the contextual information of intermediate features at different layers, a Modulator adaptively transforms these representations. Subsequently, they are injected into the intermediate layers via additive fusion, dynamically reshaping the feature distribution to adapt to the downstream task without altering the VFM's pre-trained weights. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method, achieving State-of-the-Art (SOTA) performance with minimal trainable parameters. For instance, on the HOSS-ReID dataset, we attain 57.9\\% and 60.5\\% mAP using only 1.54M and 7.05M parameters, respectively.

We investigate the so-called reasoning capabilities of LLMs over novel symbolic representations by introducing an experimental framework that tests their ability to process and manipulate unfamiliar symbols. We introduce semantic deceptions: situations in which symbols carry misleading semantic associations due to their form, such as being embedded in specific contexts, designed to probe whether LLMs can maintain symbolic abstraction or whether they default to exploiting learned semantic associations. We redefine standard digits and mathematical operators using novel symbols, and task LLMs with solving simple calculations expressed in this altered notation. The objective is: (1) to assess LLMs' capacity for abstraction and manipulation of arbitrary symbol systems; (2) to evaluate their ability to resist misleading semantic cues that conflict with the task's symbolic logic. Through experiments with four LLMs we show that semantic cues can significantly deteriorate reasoning models' performance on very simple tasks. They reveal limitations in current LLMs' ability for symbolic manipulations and highlight a tendency to over-rely on surface-level semantics, suggesting that chain-of-thoughts may amplify reliance on statistical correlations. Even in situations where LLMs seem to correctly follow instructions, semantic cues still impact basic capabilities. These limitations raise ethical and societal concerns, undermining the widespread and pernicious tendency to attribute reasoning abilities to LLMs and suggesting how LLMs might fail, in particular in decision-making contexts where robust symbolic reasoning is essential and should not be compromised by residual semantic associations inherited from the model's training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u65b0\u7b26\u53f7\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u8bef\u5bfc\u65f6\uff0c\u5176\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002\u5373\u4f7f\u5904\u7406\u7b80\u5355\u4efb\u52a1\uff0cLLMs\u4e5f\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u8868\u5c42\u8bed\u4e49\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u7edf\u8ba1\u5173\u8054\u800c\u975e\u62bd\u8c61\u7b26\u53f7\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u66b4\u9732\u51fa\u4f26\u7406\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dLLMs\u88ab\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5f52\u56e0\u2018\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u2019\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u9700\u8981\u7a33\u5065\u7b26\u53f7\u903b\u8f91\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u573a\u666f\uff08\u5982\u533b\u7597\u3001\u53f8\u6cd5\uff09\u4e2d\uff0c\u5176\u4f9d\u8d56\u8868\u9762\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u5173\u8054\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e25\u91cd\u793e\u4f1a\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63ed\u793aLLMs\u662f\u5426\u5177\u5907\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u62bd\u8c61\u80fd\u529b\u53ca\u5bf9\u8bed\u4e49\u8bef\u5bfc\u7684\u62b5\u6297\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u65b0\u7b26\u53f7\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u6570\u5b57\u548c\u6570\u5b66\u7b26\u53f7\uff1b2\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u2018\u8bed\u4e49\u6b3a\u9a97\u2019\uff08\u5982\u5c06\u2018+\u2019\u66ff\u6362\u4e3a\u5e72\u6270\u5f62\u6001\u7b26\u53f7\uff09\uff1b3\uff09\u6d4b\u8bd54\u79cdLLMs\u89e3\u51b3\u65b0\u7b26\u53f7\u4e0b\u7b80\u5355\u8ba1\u7b97\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff1b4\uff09\u5206\u6790\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\uff08CoT\uff09\u5bf9\u8bed\u4e49\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u6709LLMs\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u6b3a\u9a97\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff08\u90e8\u5206\u4efb\u52a1\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u8d8550%\uff09\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u6b63\u786e\u6267\u884c\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u4ecd\u53d7\u5e72\u6270\u7b26\u53f7\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u7b26\u53f7\u64cd\u4f5c\u80fd\u529b\u8584\u5f31\uff0c\u4e14\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u53cd\u800c\u5f3a\u5316\u7edf\u8ba1\u5173\u8054\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524dLLMs\u7684\u2018\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u2019\u672c\u8d28\u662f\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u9762\u6a21\u5f0f\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u771f\u6b63\u62bd\u8c61\u903b\u8f91\u64cd\u4f5c\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u7f3a\u9677\u5bf9\u4f9d\u8d56\u7b26\u53f7\u903b\u8f91\u7684\u5173\u952e\u51b3\u7b56\u9886\u57df\uff08\u5982\u533b\u7597\u8bca\u65ad\u3001\u6cd5\u5f8b\u63a8\u7406\uff09\u6784\u6210\u6f5c\u5728\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u9700\u8b66\u60d5LLMs\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u8bef\u5224\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Early detection and diagnosis of pulmonary nodules are essential for improving patient survival rates. Although previous research has integrated multimodal and multi-temporal information, outperforming single modality and single time point, the fusion methods are limited to inefficient vector concatenation and simple mutual attention, highlighting the need for more effective multimodal information fusion. To address these challenges, we introduce a Dual-Graph Spatiotemporal Attention Network, which leverages temporal variations and multimodal data to enhance the accuracy of predictions. Our methodology involves developing a Global-Local Feature Encoder to better capture the local, global, and fused characteristics of pulmonary nodules. Additionally, a Dual-Graph Construction method organizes multimodal features into inter-modal and intra-modal graphs.

Existing VLMs predominantly digest and understand high-bitrate compressed images, while their ability to interpret low-bitrate compressed images has yet to be explored by far. In this paper, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark to evaluate the ability of VLM against compressed images, varying existing widely used image codecs and diverse set of tasks, encompassing over one million compressed images in our benchmark. Next, we analyse the source of performance gap, by categorising the gap from a) the information loss during compression and b) generalisation failure of VLM. We visualize these gaps with concrete examples and identify that for compressed images, only the generalization gap can be mitigated. Finally, we propose a universal VLM adaptor to enhance model performance on images compressed by existing codecs. Consequently, we demonstrate that a single adaptor can improve VLM performance across images with varying codecs and bitrates by 10%-30%. We believe that our benchmark and enhancement method provide valuable insights and contribute toward bridging the gap between VLMs and compressed images.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u9996\u4e2a\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u5904\u7406\u538b\u7f29\u56fe\u50cf\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4f4e\u6bd4\u7279\u7387\u538b\u7f29\u56fe\u50cf\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u7528\u9002\u914d\u5668\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u534710%-30%\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709VLMs\u4f9d\u8d56\u9ad8\u6bd4\u7279\u7387\u538b\u7f29\u56fe\u50cf\u800c\u5ffd\u7565\u4f4e\u6bd4\u7279\u7387\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u9700\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u63ed\u793a\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\u5e76\u89e3\u51b3\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u9700\u6c42", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u8986\u76d6\u767e\u4e07\u7ea7\u538b\u7f29\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u591a\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u5206\u6790\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7VLM\u9002\u914d\u5668", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u4e3a\u4e0d\u53ef\u9006\u786c\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u800c\u6cdb\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\u53ef\u88ab\u9002\u914d\u5668\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\uff0c\u5355\u4e00\u9002\u914d\u5668\u53ef\u8de8\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd10%-30%", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u4f4e\u6bd4\u7279\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u8f93\u5165\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684VLM\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u590d\u7528\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u666e\u9002\u6027\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u538b\u7f29\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u7406\u89e3\u95f4\u7684\u65b0\u5174\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411"}}

MediEval generates diverse factual and counterfactual medical statements within real patient contexts, enabling systematic evaluation across a 4-quadrant framework that jointly considers knowledge grounding and contextual consistency. Using this framework, we identify critical failure modes, including hallucinated support and truth inversion, that current proprietary, open-source, and domain-specific LLMs frequently exhibit. To address these risks, we propose Counterfactual Risk-Aware Fine-tuning (CoRFu), a DPO-based method with an asymmetric penalty targeting unsafe confusions.

Traditional supervised models leverage explicit 3D geometry but exhibit limited generalization, owing to the scarcity of 3D vision-language datasets and the limited reasoning capabilities compared to modern vision-language models (VLMs). We propose PanoGrounder, a generalizable 3DVG framework that couples multi-modal panoramic representation with pretrained 2D VLMs for strong vision-language reasoning. Panoramic renderings, augmented with 3D semantic and geometric features, serve as an intermediate representation between 2D and 3D, and offer two major benefits: (i) they can be directly fed to VLMs with minimal adaptation and (ii) they retain long-range object-to-object relations thanks to their 360-degree field of view. We devise a three-stage pipeline that places a compact set of panoramic viewpoints considering the scene layout and geometry, grounds a text query on each panoramic rendering with a VLM, and fuses per-view predictions into a single 3D bounding box via lifting.

Super and Ultra models are trained with NVFP4 and incorporate LatentMoE, a novel approach that improves model quality. The two larger models also include MTP layers for faster text generation. All Nemotron 3 models are post-trained using multi-environment reinforcement learning enabling reasoning, multi-step tool use, and support granular reasoning budget control.

Visual programming addresses this by decomposing problems into steps calling specialized tools, yet existing methods rely on either fixed toolsets or speculative tool induction before solving problems, resulting in suboptimal programs and poor utilization of induced tools. We present Transductive Visual Programming (TVP), a novel framework that builds new tools from its own experience rather than speculation. TVP first solves problems using basic tools while accumulating experiential solutions into an Example Library, then abstracts recurring patterns from these programs into reusable higher-level tools for an evolving Tool Library. This allows TVP to tackle new problems with increasingly powerful tools learned from experience. On Omni3D-Bench, TVP achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming GPT-4o by 22% and the previous best visual programming system by 11%. Our transductively learned tools are used 5x more frequently as core program dependency than inductively created ones, demonstrating more effective tool discovery and reuse. The evolved tools also show strong generalization to unseen spatial tasks, achieving superior performance on benchmarks from SpatialScore-Hard collection without any testset-specific modification. Our work establishes experience-driven transductive tool creation as a powerful paradigm for building self-evolving visual programming agents that effectively tackle challenging spatial reasoning tasks.

Prior progressive approaches are inherently limited by inference instability and error accumulation. To tackle these limitations, we present a Collaborative Multi-Agent Reasoning Framework that explicitly decouples Semantic Planning from Visual Synthesis. By employing specialized agents for upfront reasoning, our method generates a structured, explicit plan before pixel generation, enabling visually and semantically coherent single-pass synthesis. We integrate this framework with two critical mechanisms: (1) a self-correcting Verification Agent that employs Chain-of-Thought reasoning to rectify visible region segmentation and identify residual occluders strictly within the Semantic Planning phase, and (2) a Diverse Hypothesis Generator that addresses the ambiguity of invisible regions by offering diverse, plausible semantic interpretations, surpassing the limited pixel-level variations of standard random seed sampling. Furthermore, addressing the limitations of traditional metrics in assessing inferred invisible content, we introduce the MAC-Score (MLLM Amodal Completion Score), a novel human-aligned evaluation metric. Validated against human judgment and ground truth, these metrics establish a robust standard for assessing structural completeness and semantic consistency with visible context.

Tracing Provenance in LLM Reasoning Distillation", "comment": null, "summary": "Reasoning distillation has attracted increasing attention. It typically leverages a large teacher model to generate reasoning paths, which are then used to fine-tune a student model so that it mimics the teacher's behavior in training contexts. However, previous approaches have lacked a detailed analysis of the origins of the distilled model's capabilities. It remains unclear whether the student can maintain consistent behaviors with the teacher in novel test-time contexts, or whether it regresses to its original output patterns, raising concerns about the generalization of distillation models. To analyse this question, we introduce a cross-model Reasoning Distillation Provenance Tracing framework. For each action (e.g., a sentence) produced by the distilled model, we obtain the predictive probabilities assigned by the teacher, the original student, and the distilled model under the same context. By comparing these probabilities, we classify each action into different categories. By systematically disentangling the provenance of each action, we experimentally demonstrate that, in test-time contexts, the distilled model can indeed generate teacher-originated actions, which correlate with and plausibly explain observed performance on distilled model. Building on this analysis, we further propose a teacher-guided data selection method. Unlike prior approach that rely on heuristics, our method directly compares teacher-student divergences on the training data, providing a principled selection criterion.

However, existing detectors often overfit to generator-specific artifacts and remain highly sensitive to real-world degradations. As generative architectures evolve and images undergo multi-round cross-platform sharing and post-processing (chain degradations), these artifact cues become obsolete and harder to detect. To address this, we propose Real-centric Envelope Modeling (REM), a new paradigm that shifts detection from learning generator artifacts to modeling the robust distribution of real images. REM introduces feature-level perturbations in self-reconstruction to generate near-real samples, and employs an envelope estimator with cross-domain consistency to learn a boundary enclosing the real image manifold. We further build RealChain, a comprehensive benchmark covering both open-source and commercial generators with simulated real-world degradation. Across eight benchmark evaluations, REM achieves an average improvement of 7.5% over state-of-the-art methods, and notably maintains exceptional generalization on the severely degraded RealChain benchmark, establishing a solid foundation for synthetic image detection under real-world conditions.

To address these gaps, we propose FEND (Foundation model-based Evaluation of Neuropsychiatric Disorders), a comprehensive multi-modal framework integrating speech and text modalities for detecting AD, depression, and ASD across the lifespan. Leveraging 13 multi-lingual datasets spanning English, Chinese, Greek, French, and Dutch, we systematically evaluate multi-modal fusion performance. Our results show that multi-modal fusion excels in AD and depression detection but underperforms in ASD due to dataset heterogeneity. We also identify modality imbalance as a prevalent issue, where multi-modal fusion fails to surpass the best mono-modal models. Cross-corpus experiments reveal robust performance in task- and language-consistent scenarios but noticeable degradation in multi-lingual and task-heterogeneous settings. By providing extensive benchmarks and a detailed analysis of performance-influencing factors, FEND advances the field of automated, lifespan-inclusive, and multi-lingual neuropsychiatric disorder assessment.

LiDAR is widely used for this purpose due to its accuracy and robustness. Recently, neural LiDAR mapping has shown impressive performance; however, most approaches rely on dense implicit representations and underutilize geometric structure, while existing voxel-guided methods struggle to achieve real-time performance. To address these challenges, we propose XGrid-Mapping, a hybrid grid framework that jointly exploits explicit and implicit representations for efficient neural LiDAR mapping. Specifically, the strategy combines a sparse grid, providing geometric priors and structural guidance, with an implicit dense grid that enriches scene representation. By coupling the VDB structure with a submap-based organization, the framework reduces computational load and enables efficient incremental mapping on a large scale. To mitigate discontinuities across submaps, we introduce a distillation-based overlap alignment strategy, in which preceding submaps supervise subsequent ones to ensure consistency in overlapping regions. To further enhance robustness and sampling efficiency, we incorporate a dynamic removal module.

Unlike standard prompting, CoT encourages the model to generate intermediate reasoning steps, non-answer tokens, that help guide the model toward more accurate final outputs. These intermediate steps enable more complex reasoning processes such as error correction, memory management, future planning, and self-reflection. However, applying CoT to non-natural language domains, such as protein and RNA language models, is not yet possible, primarily due to the limited expressiveness of their token spaces (e.g., amino acid tokens). In this work, we propose and define the concept of language expressiveness: the ability of a given language, using its tokens and grammar, to encode information. We show that the limited expressiveness of protein language severely restricts the applicability of CoT-style reasoning. To overcome this, we introduce reflection pretraining, for the first time in a biological sequence model, which enables the model to engage in intermediate reasoning through the generation of auxiliary \"thinking tokens\" beyond simple answer tokens. Theoretically, we demonstrate that our augmented token set significantly enhances biological language expressiveness, thereby improving the overall reasoning capacity of the model. Experimentally, our pretraining approach teaches protein models to self-correct and leads to substantial performance gains compared to standard pretraining.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper introduces 'reflection pretraining' to enable Chain-of-Thought (CoT) style reasoning in biological language models (e.g., protein/RNA) by enhancing token space expressiveness through auxiliary 'thinking tokens', overcoming limitations of traditional CoT application in low-expressive domains.", "motivation": "Existing CoT prompting in NLP relies on rich token spaces to generate intermediate reasoning steps, but biological sequence models (e.g., protein language models) lack sufficient linguistic expressiveness (due to limited token vocabulary like amino acid sequences) to support complex reasoning processes like error correction or self-reflection.", "method": "1) Theorize 'language expressiveness' as the ability to encode information via tokens/grammar, 2) Propose reflection pretraining using learnable 'thinking tokens' to augment biological language spaces, and 3) Validate through mathematical analysis of token space expansion and empirical comparison against standard pretraining methods.", "result": "Reflection pretraining theoretically expanded expressiveness in biological language models, demonstrated practical self-correction capabilities in protein models, and achieved significant performance improvements over conventional pretraining approaches in experimental validations.", "conclusion": "The study establishes that explicit enhancement of linguistic expressiveness through reflection pretraining enables intermediate reasoning in previously intractable domains, providing a critical theoretical and technical framework to bridge CoT-style reasoning gaps between NLP and biological sequence modeling."}}

However, distillation over lengthy sequences with prompt (P), chain-of-thought (CoT), and answer (A) segments makes the process computationally expensive. In this work, we investigate how the allocation of supervision across different segments (P, CoT, A) affects student performance. Our analysis shows that selective knowledge distillation over only the CoT tokens can be effective when the prompt and answer information is encompassed by it. Building on this insight, we establish a truncation protocol to quantify computation-quality tradeoffs as a function of sequence length. We observe that training on only the first $50\\%$ of tokens of every training sequence can retain, on average, $\\approx94\\%$ of full-sequence performance on math benchmarks while reducing training time, memory usage, and FLOPs by about $50\\%$ each.

In this study, we propose FluencyVE, which is a simple yet effective one-shot video editing approach. FluencyVE integrates the linear time-series module, Mamba, into a video editing model based on pretrained Stable Diffusion models, replacing the temporal attention layer. This enables global frame-level attention while reducing the computational costs. In addition, we employ low-rank approximation matrices to replace the query and key weight matrices in the causal attention, and use a weighted averaging technique during training to update the attention scores.

This capability raises significant privacy concerns regarding malicious misuse of personal portraits. However, no efficient defense framework exists to protect such videos against 3D-field TFG methods. While image-based defenses could apply per-frame 2D perturbations, they incur prohibitive computational costs, severe video quality degradation, failing to disrupt 3D information for video protection. To address this, we propose a novel and efficient video defense framework against 3D-field TFG methods, which protects portrait video by perturbing the 3D information acquisition process while maintain high-fidelity video quality. Specifically, our method introduces: (1) a similarity-guided parameter sharing mechanism for computational efficiency, and (2) a multi-scale dual-domain attention module to jointly optimize spatial-frequency perturbations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework exhibits strong defense capability and achieves a 47x acceleration over the fastest baseline while maintaining high fidelity. Moreover, it remains robust against scaling operations and state-of-the-art purification attacks, and the effectiveness of our design choices is further validated through ablation studies.

However, existing LLM-focused clarification benchmarks primarily assume single-turn interactions or cooperative users, limiting their ability to evaluate clarification behavior in realistic settings. We introduce \\textbf{ClarifyMT-Bench}, a benchmark for multi-turn clarification grounded in a five-dimensional ambiguity taxonomy and a set of six behaviorally diverse simulated user personas. Through a hybrid LLM-human pipeline, we construct 6,120 multi-turn dialogues capturing diverse ambiguity sources and interaction patterns. Evaluating ten representative LLMs uncovers a consistent under-clarification bias: LLMs tend to answer prematurely, and performance degrades as dialogue depth increases. To mitigate this, we propose \\textbf{ClarifyAgent}, an agentic approach that decomposes clarification into perception, forecasting, tracking, and planning, substantially improving robustness across ambiguity conditions.

However, most facial recognition models are trained on visible light datasets, leading to substantial performance degradation on infrared inputs due to significant domain shifts. Early feature-based methods for infrared face recognition proved ineffective, prompting researchers to adopt generative approaches that convert infrared images into visible light images for improved recognition. This paradigm, known as Heterogeneous Face Recognition (HFR), faces challenges such as model and modality discrepancies, leading to distortion and feature loss in generated images. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a novel latent diffusion-based model designed to generate high-quality visible face images from thermal inputs while preserving critical identity features. A multi-attribute classifier is incorporated to extract key facial attributes from visible images, mitigating feature loss during infrared-to-visible image restoration.

To address this gap, this paper introduces SpidR-Adapt for rapid adaptation to new languages using minimal unlabeled data. We cast such low-resource speech representation learning as a meta-learning problem and construct a multi-task adaptive pre-training (MAdaPT) protocol which formulates the adaptation process as a bi-level optimization framework. To enable scalable meta-training under this framework, we propose a novel heuristic solution, first-order bi-level optimization (FOBLO), avoiding heavy computation costs. Finally, we stabilize meta-training by using a robust initialization through interleaved supervision which alternates self-supervised and supervised objectives. Empirically, SpidR-Adapt achieves rapid gains in phonemic discriminability (ABX) and spoken language modeling (sWUGGY, sBLIMP, tSC), improving over in-domain language models after training on less than 1h of target-language audio, over $100\\times$ more data-efficient than standard training. These findings highlight a practical, architecture-agnostic path toward biologically inspired, data-efficient representations.

Ma"], "title": "Your Reasoning Benchmark May Not Test Reasoning: Revealing Perception Bottleneck in Abstract Reasoning Benchmarks", "comment": null, "summary": "Reasoning benchmarks such as the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) and ARC-AGI are widely used to assess progress in artificial intelligence and are often interpreted as probes of core, so-called ``fluid'' reasoning abilities. Despite their apparent simplicity for humans, these tasks remain challenging for frontier vision-language models (VLMs), a gap commonly attributed to deficiencies in machine reasoning. We challenge this interpretation and hypothesize that the gap arises primarily from limitations in visual perception rather than from shortcomings in inductive reasoning.\n  To verify this hypothesis, we introduce a two-stage experimental pipeline that explicitly separates perception and reasoning. In the perception stage, each image is independently converted into a natural-language description, while in the reasoning stage a model induces and applies rules using these descriptions. This design prevents leakage of cross-image inductive signals and isolates reasoning from perception bottlenecks. Across three ARC-style datasets, Mini-ARC, ACRE, and Bongard-LOGO, we show that the perception capability is the dominant factor underlying the observed performance gap by comparing the two-stage pipeline with against standard end-to-end one-stage evaluation. Manual inspection of reasoning traces in the VLM outputs further reveals that approximately 80 percent of model failures stem from perception errors. Together, these results demonstrate that ARC-style benchmarks conflate perceptual and reasoning challenges and that observed performance gaps may overstate deficiencies in machine reasoning. Our findings underscore the need for evaluation protocols that disentangle perception from reasoning when assessing progress in machine intelligence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u53d1\u73b0\u4f20\u7edf\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08\u5982ARC\uff09\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u8ddd\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u673a\u5668\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7f3a\u9677\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5206\u79bb\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e80%\u6a21\u578b\u9519\u8bef\u6e90\u4e8e\u611f\u77e5\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6df7\u6dc6\u4e24\u8005\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8ba4\u4e3a\u524d\u6cbf\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u5728ARC\u7b49\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u7684\u843d\u540e\u8868\u73b0\u662f\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u5bfc\u81f4\uff0c\u4f46\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u5047\u8bbe\uff1a\u8be5\u5dee\u8ddd\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u5c06\u56fe\u50cf\u72ec\u7acb\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63cf\u8ff0\uff08\u9694\u79bb\u611f\u77e5\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff09\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u63cf\u8ff0\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\uff08\u72ec\u7acb\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5f52\u7eb3\u80fd\u529b\uff09\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u4e0e\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "1) \u5728Mini-ARC/ACRE/Bongard-LOGO\u4e09\u5927\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u611f\u77e5\u4e3b\u5bfc\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\uff1b2) 80%\u6a21\u578b\u5931\u8d25\u6e90\u81ea\u611f\u77e5\u9519\u8bef\uff1b3) \u624b\u52a8\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u8de8\u56fe\u50cf\u5f52\u7eb3\u4fe1\u606f\u672a\u6cc4\u6f0f\uff1b4) \u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u88ab\u9519\u8bef\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u63a8\u7406\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "conclusion": "ARC\u7c7b\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6df7\u6dc6\u4e86\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5938\u5927\u673a\u5668\u63a8\u7406\u7f3a\u9677\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u667a\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u5fc5\u987b\u89e3\u8026\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u7cbe\u51c6\u8ba4\u77e5\u6d4b\u8bd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

In Proceedings of the 32nd ACM International Conference on Multimedia (MM '24)", "summary": "Object pose tracking is one of the pivotal technologies in multimedia, attracting ever-growing attention in recent years. Existing methods employing traditional cameras encounter numerous challenges such as motion blur, sensor noise, partial occlusion, and changing lighting conditions. The emerging bio-inspired sensors, particularly event cameras, possess advantages such as high dynamic range and low latency, which hold the potential to address the aforementioned challenges. In this work, we present an optical flow-guided 6DoF object pose tracking method with an event camera. A 2D-3D hybrid feature extraction strategy is firstly utilized to detect corners and edges from events and object models, which characterizes object motion precisely. Then, we search for the optical flow of corners by maximizing the event-associated probability within a spatio-temporal window, and establish the correlation between corners and edges guided by optical flow. Furthermore, by minimizing the distances between corners and edges, the 6DoF object pose is iteratively optimized to achieve continuous pose tracking. Experimental results of both simulated and real events demonstrate that our methods outperform event-based state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and robustness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5229\u7528\u4e8b\u4ef6\u76f8\u673a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5149\u6d41\u5f15\u5bfc\u76846\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u7269\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u8ffd\u8e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u76f8\u673a\u5728\u59ff\u6001\u8ffd\u8e2a\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u7cca\u3001\u5149\u7167\u53d8\u5316\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u800c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u76f8\u673a\u7684\u9ad8\u52a8\u6001\u8303\u56f4\u548c\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7279\u6027\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa2D-3D\u6df7\u5408\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5149\u6d41\u5173\u8054\u89d2\u70b9\u4e0e\u8fb9\u7f18\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6570\u636e\u4f18\u53166DoF\u59ff\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u548c\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u4e8b\u4ef6\u76f8\u673a\u59ff\u6001\u8ffd\u8e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e8b\u4ef6\u76f8\u673a\u7279\u6027\u4e0e\u5149\u6d41\u5f15\u5bfc\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u878d\u5408\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u59ff\u6001\u8ffd\u8e2a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, currently, most sign language datasets are video-based and limited to automatically reconstructed 2D human poses (i.e., keypoints) and lack accurate 3D information. Furthermore, existing state-of-the-art for automatic 3D human pose estimation from sign language videos is prone to self-occlusion, noise, and motion blur effects, resulting in poor reconstruction quality. In response to this, we introduce DexAvatar, a novel framework to reconstruct bio-mechanically accurate fine-grained hand articulations and body movements from in-the-wild monocular sign language videos, guided by learned 3D hand and body priors.

To quantify this uncertainty, we introduce Denoising Entropy, a computable metric that serves as an internal signal for evaluating generative process. Leveraging this metric, we propose two algorithms designed to optimize the decoding path: a post-hoc selection method and a real-time guidance strategy. Experiments demonstrate that our entropy-guided methods significantly improve generation quality, consistently boosting accuracy on challenging reasoning, planning, and code benchmarks.

Progress remains hindered by three coupled factors: the scarcity of large, high-quality image-text corpora; the lack of precise, fine-grained semantic control, which forces reliance on non-semantic cues; and terminological heterogeneity, where diverse phrasings for the same diagnostic concept impede reliable text conditioning. We introduce UniPath, a semantics-driven pathology image generation framework that leverages mature diagnostic understanding to enable controllable generation. UniPath implements Multi-Stream Control: a Raw-Text stream; a High-Level Semantics stream that uses learnable queries to a frozen pathology MLLM to distill paraphrase-robust Diagnostic Semantic Tokens and to expand prompts into diagnosis-aware attribute bundles; and a Prototype stream that affords component-level morphological control via a prototype bank. On the data front, we curate a 2.65M image-text corpus and a finely annotated, high-quality 68K subset to alleviate data scarcity. For a comprehensive assessment, we establish a four-tier evaluation hierarchy tailored to pathology. Extensive experiments demonstrate UniPath's SOTA performance, including a Patho-FID of 80.9 (51% better than the second-best) and fine-grained semantic control achieving 98.7% of the real-image.

To address the dilemma of balancing efficiency and effectiveness, we introduce a self-supervised multimodal skeleton-based action representation learning framework, named Decomposition and Composition. The Decomposition strategy meticulously decomposes the fused multimodal features into distinct unimodal features, subsequently aligning them with their respective ground truth unimodal counterparts. On the other hand, the Composition strategy integrates multiple unimodal features, leveraging them as self-supervised guidance to enhance the learning of multimodal representations.

Using multiple views offers clear advantages, yet this setting remains relatively underexplored and existing methods often struggle to generalize across diverse environments. In this work we introduce UniPR-3D, the first VPR architecture that effectively integrates information from multiple views. UniPR-3D builds on a VGGT backbone capable of encoding multi-view 3D representations, which we adapt by designing feature aggregators and fine-tune for the place recognition task. To construct our descriptor, we jointly leverage the 3D tokens and intermediate 2D tokens produced by VGGT. Based on their distinct characteristics, we design dedicated aggregation modules for 2D and 3D features, allowing our descriptor to capture fine-grained texture cues while also reasoning across viewpoints. To further enhance generalization, we incorporate both single- and multi-frame aggregation schemes, along with a variable-length sequence retrieval strategy. Our experiments show that UniPR-3D sets a new state of the art, outperforming both single- and multi-view baselines and highlighting the effectiveness of geometry-grounded tokens for VPR.

To address this limitation, we present T2AV-Compass, a unified benchmark for comprehensive evaluation of T2AV systems, consisting of 500 diverse and complex prompts constructed via a taxonomy-driven pipeline to ensure semantic richness and physical plausibility. Besides, T2AV-Compass introduces a dual-level evaluation framework that integrates objective signal-level metrics for video quality, audio quality, and cross-modal alignment with a subjective MLLM-as-a-Judge protocol for instruction following and realism assessment. Extensive evaluation of 11 representative T2AVsystems reveals that even the strongest models fall substantially short of human-level realism and cross-modal consistency, with persistent failures in audio realism, fine-grained synchronization, instruction following, etc. These results indicate significant improvement room for future models and highlight the value of T2AV-Compass as a challenging and diagnostic testbed for advancing text-to-audio-video generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86T2AV-Compass\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u5230\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u6307\u6807\u548c\u72ed\u7a84\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5728\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u548c\u611f\u77e5\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6587\u672c\u5230\u97f3\u89c6\u9891(T2AV)\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u6563\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0d\u5168\u9762\u7684\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u590d\u6742\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u672a\u8fbe\u5230\u4eba\u7c7b\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u7c7b\u4f53\u7cfb\u7684\u6784\u5efa\u6d41\u7a0b\u8bbe\u8ba1500\u4e2a\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u590d\u6742\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u878d\u5408\u4fe1\u53f7\u7ea7\u5ba2\u89c2\u6307\u6807(\u89c6\u9891\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u97f3\u9891\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50)\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e3b\u89c2\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u7684\u53cc\u5c42\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u5bf911\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027T2AV\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u97f3\u9891\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u3001\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u540c\u6b65\u548c\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u6c34\u5e73\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "conclusion": "T2AV-Compass\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u5f0f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u66b4\u9732\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765T2AV\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u534f\u540c\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u8fdb\u6b65\u63d0\u4f9b\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u3002"}}

Accurately and efficiently recognizing both is crucial for developing robust and generalizable document parsing systems. Recently, vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved impressive unified recognition of text and formulas. However, they are large-sized and computationally demanding, restricting their usage in many applications. In this paper, we propose UniRec-0.1B, a unified recognition model with only 0.1B parameters. It is capable of performing text and formula recognition at multiple levels, including characters, words, lines, paragraphs, and documents. To implement this task, we first establish UniRec40M, a large-scale dataset comprises 40 million text, formula and their mix samples, enabling the training of a powerful yet lightweight model. Secondly, we identify two challenges when building such a lightweight but unified expert model. They are: structural variability across hierarchies and semantic entanglement between textual and formulaic content. To tackle these, we introduce a hierarchical supervision training that explicitly guides structural comprehension, and a semantic-decoupled tokenizer that separates text and formula representations. Finally, we develop a comprehensive evaluation benchmark covering Chinese and English documents from multiple domains and with multiple levels. Experimental results on this and public benchmarks demonstrate that UniRec-0.1B outperforms both general-purpose VLMs and leading document parsing expert models, while achieving a 2-9$\\times$ speedup, validating its effectiveness and efficiency.

The primary challenge is to accurately align the inpainted areas with the user-provided prompts while maintaining a high degree of visual fidelity. While existing inpainting methods have produced visually convincing results by leveraging the pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models, they still struggle to uphold both prompt alignment and visual rationality simultaneously. In this work, we introduce FreeInpaint, a plug-and-play tuning-free approach that directly optimizes the diffusion latents on the fly during inference to improve the faithfulness of the generated images. Technically, we introduce a prior-guided noise optimization method that steers model attention towards valid inpainting regions by optimizing the initial noise.

VLMs, as a bridge to connect the visual world and language corpus, receive both visual content and various text-only user instructions to generate corresponding responses. Though great success has been achieved by VLMs in various fields, in this work, we ask whether the existing VLMs can act as domain experts, accurately answering marine questions, which require significant domain expertise and address special domain challenges/requirements. To comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness and explore the boundary of existing VLMs, we construct the first large-scale marine VLM dataset and benchmark called MarineEval, with 2,000 image-based question-answering pairs. During our dataset construction, we ensure the diversity and coverage of the constructed data: 7 task dimensions and 20 capacity dimensions. The domain requirements are specially integrated into the data construction and further verified by the corresponding marine domain experts. We comprehensively benchmark 17 existing VLMs on our MarineEval and also investigate the limitations of existing models in answering marine research questions. The experimental results reveal that existing VLMs cannot effectively answer the domain-specific questions, and there is still a large room for further performance improvements. We hope our new benchmark and observations will facilitate future research.

However, existing methods typically rely on unaligned image and text encoders, which necessitate complex interaction modules for multimodal fusion. While CLIP provides a pre-aligned multimodal feature space, its direct application to medical imaging is limited by three main issues: insufficient preservation of fine-grained anatomical structures, inadequate modeling of complex clinical descriptions, and domain-specific semantic misalignment. To tackle these challenges, we propose TGC-Net, a CLIP-based framework focusing on parameter-efficient, task-specific adaptations. Specifically, it incorporates a Semantic-Structural Synergy Encoder (SSE) that augments CLIP's ViT with a CNN branch for multi-scale structural refinement, a Domain-Augmented Text Encoder (DATE) that injects large-language-model-derived medical knowledge, and a Vision-Language Calibration Module (VLCM) that refines cross-modal correspondence in a unified feature space.

The dataset provides fine-grained visual and textual annotations that capture morphology-oriented attributes across diverse marine species.

For the first time, we explore continuous representations of human motion sequences, featuring the ability to interpolate, inbetween, and even extrapolate any input motion sequences at arbitrary frame rates. To achieve this, we propose a novel parametric activation-induced hierarchical implicit representation framework, referred to as NAME, based on Implicit Neural Representations (INRs). Our method introduces a hierarchical temporal encoding mechanism that extracts features from motion sequences at multiple temporal scales, enabling effective capture of intricate temporal patterns. Additionally, we integrate a custom parametric activation function, powered by Fourier transformations, into the MLP-based decoder to enhance the expressiveness of the continuous representation. This parametric formulation significantly augments the model's ability to represent complex motion behaviors with high accuracy.

The proposed approach adopts a two-stage generation pipeline: a coarse global structure is first synthesized and then refined to produce detailed, high-quality geometry. To support reliable 3D generation, we develop a comprehensive data processing pipeline that includes a novel watertight processing method and high-quality data filtering. This pipeline improves the geometric quality of publicly available 3D datasets by removing low-quality samples, filling holes, and thickening thin structures, while preserving fine-grained geometric details. To enable fine-grained geometry refinement, we decouple spatial localization from geometric detail synthesis in the diffusion process. We achieve this by performing voxel-based refinement at fixed spatial locations, where voxel queries derived from coarse geometry provide explicit positional anchors encoded via RoPE, allowing the diffusion model to focus on synthesizing local geometric details within a reduced, structured solution space. Our model is trained exclusively on publicly available 3D datasets, achieving strong geometric quality despite limited training resources.

Yet, the extent to which these models perform visual reasoning as opposed to relying on linguistic priors remains unclear. To address this, we introduce VisRes Bench, a benchmark designed to study visual reasoning in naturalistic settings without contextual language supervision. Analyzing model behavior across three levels of complexity, we uncover clear limitations in perceptual and relational visual reasoning capacities. VisRes isolates distinct reasoning abilities across its levels. Level 1 probes perceptual completion and global image matching under perturbations such as blur, texture changes, occlusion, and rotation; Level 2 tests rule-based inference over a single attribute (e.g., color, count, orientation); and Level 3 targets compositional reasoning that requires integrating multiple visual attributes. Across more than 19,000 controlled task images, we find that state-of-the-art VLMs perform near random under subtle perceptual perturbations, revealing limited abstraction beyond pattern recognition.

As a result, they are limited in their ability to handle reasoning tasks that are predominantly visual.

However, these strategies impose restrictive priors on what \"useful\" visual abstractions look like, add heavy annotation costs, and struggle to generalize across tasks. To address this critical limitation, we propose a task-agnostic mechanism that trains LMMs to discover and use visual reasoning tokens without explicit supervision. These tokens attend globally and re-encode the image in a task-adaptive way, enabling the model to extract relevant visual information without hand-crafted supervision.

Recent methods align the textual description with human motion at the sequence level, neglecting the internal semantic structure of modalities. However, both motion descriptions and motion sequences can be naturally decomposed into smaller and semantically coherent segments, which can serve as atomic alignment units to achieve finer-grained correspondence. Motivated by this, we propose SegMo, a novel Segment-aligned text-conditioned human Motion generation framework to achieve fine-grained text-motion alignment. Our framework consists of three modules: (1) Text Segment Extraction, which decomposes complex textual descriptions into temporally ordered phrases, each representing a simple atomic action; (2) Motion Segment Extraction, which partitions complete motion sequences into corresponding motion segments; and (3) Fine-grained Text-Motion Alignment, which aligns text and motion segments with contrastive learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SegMo improves the strong baseline on two widely used datasets, achieving an improved TOP 1 score of 0.553 on the HumanML3D test set. Moreover, thanks to the learned shared embedding space for text and motion segments, SegMo can also be applied to retrieval-style tasks such as motion grounding and motion-to-text retrieval.", "AI": {"tldr": "SegMo\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u6587\u672c-\u52a8\u4f5c\u7247\u6bb5\u5bf9\u9f50\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u76843D\u4eba\u4f53\u52a8\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u5728\u5168\u5c40\u5e8f\u5217\u7ea7\u522b\u5bf9\u9f50\u6587\u672c\u4e0e\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u4e24\u8005\u5185\u90e8\u53ef\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5316\u5b50\u7247\u6bb5\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u800c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b50\u7247\u6bb5\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\u80fd\u5efa\u7acb\u66f4\u7cbe\u51c6\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5173\u8054\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6Segment-aligned\u6587\u672c\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff1a1) \u6587\u672c\u7247\u6bb5\u63d0\u53d6\uff08\u5c06\u63cf\u8ff0\u62c6\u89e3\u4e3a\u65f6\u5e8f\u77ed\u8bed\uff09\uff1b2) \u52a8\u4f5c\u7247\u6bb5\u63d0\u53d6\uff08\u5206\u5272\u8fd0\u52a8\u5e8f\u5217\uff09\uff1b3) \u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u5728HumanML3D\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u8fbe\u52300.553\u7684TOP1\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u4e14\u652f\u6301\u52a8\u4f5c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3001\u52a8\u4f5c-\u6587\u672c\u68c0\u7d22\u7b49\u68c0\u7d22\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u7247\u6bb5\u5bf9\u9f50\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u8fd8\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u9a71\u52a8\u52a8\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5e94\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

However, its practical realization is often hindered by prohibitive costs and complex real-world constraints. Although emerging video generation models offer a virtual alternative, existing approaches typically rely on naive clip concatenation, which frequently fails to maintain visual smoothness and temporal coherence. In this paper, we introduce DreaMontage, a comprehensive framework designed for arbitrary frame-guided generation, capable of synthesizing seamless, expressive, and long-duration one-shot videos from diverse user-provided inputs. To achieve this, we address the challenge through three primary dimensions. (i) We integrate a lightweight intermediate-conditioning mechanism into the DiT architecture. By employing an Adaptive Tuning strategy that effectively leverages base training data, we unlock robust arbitrary-frame control capabilities. (ii) To enhance visual fidelity and cinematic expressiveness, we curate a high-quality dataset and implement a Visual Expression SFT stage. In addressing critical issues such as subject motion rationality and transition smoothness, we apply a Tailored DPO scheme, which significantly improves the success rate and usability of the generated content. (iii) To facilitate the production of extended sequences, we design a Segment-wise Auto-Regressive (SAR) inference strategy that operates in a memory-efficient manner.

Existing single-class or multi-class anomaly detection (AD) models typically rely on fixed modality configurations, require repetitive training, or fail to generalize to unseen modality combinations, limiting their clinical scalability. In this work, we present a unified Any-Modality AD framework that performs robust anomaly detection and localization under arbitrary MRI modality availability. The framework integrates a dual-pathway DINOv2 encoder with a feature distribution alignment mechanism that statistically aligns incomplete-modality features with full-modality representations, enabling stable inference even with severe modality dropout. To further enhance semantic consistency, we introduce an Intrinsic Normal Prototypes (INPs) extractor and an INP-guided decoder that reconstruct only normal anatomical patterns while naturally amplifying abnormal deviations. Through randomized modality masking and indirect feature completion during training, the model learns to adapt to all modality configurations without re-training. Extensive experiments on BraTS2018, MU-Glioma-Post, and Pretreat-MetsToBrain-Masks demonstrate that our approach consistently surpasses state-of-the-art industrial and medical AD baselines across 7 modality combinations, achieving superior generalization.

Existing classifier-free guidance methods typically achieve conditioning indirectly by modeling the joint distribution of data and conditions, which often results in limited controllability over the specified conditions. Classifier-based guidance enforces conditions through an external classifier, but the model may exploit this mechanism to raise the classifier score without genuinely satisfying the intended condition, resulting in adversarial artifacts and limited effective controllability. In this paper, we propose Attention-Conditional Diffusion (ACD), a novel framework for direct conditional control in video diffusion models via attention supervision. By aligning the model's attention maps with external control signals, ACD achieves better controllability. To support this, we introduce a sparse 3D-aware object layout as an efficient conditioning signal, along with a dedicated Layout ControlNet and an automated annotation pipeline for scalable layout integration.

Although many methods have been proposed to detect table structures and extract cell contents, accurately identifying table segment boundaries (rows and columns) remains challenging, particularly in low-resolution or noisy images. In many real-world scenarios, table data are incomplete or degraded, limiting the adaptability of transformer-based methods to noisy inputs. Mask-based edge detection techniques have shown greater robustness under such conditions, as their sensitivity can be adjusted through threshold tuning; however, existing approaches typically apply masks directly to images, leading to noise sensitivity, resolution loss, or high computational cost. This paper proposes a novel multi-scale signal-processing method for detecting table edges from table masks. Row and column transitions are modeled as one-dimensional signals and processed using Gaussian convolution with progressively increasing variances, followed by statistical thresholding to suppress noise while preserving stable structural edges. Detected signal peaks are mapped back to image coordinates to obtain accurate segment boundaries. Experimental results show that applying the proposed approach to column edge detection improves Cell-Aware Segmentation Accuracy (CASA) a layout-aware metric evaluating both textual correctness and correct cell placement from 67% to 76% on the PubLayNet-1M benchmark when using TableNet with PyTesseract OCR. The method is robust to resolution variations through zero-padding and scaling strategies and produces optimized structured tabular outputs suitable for downstream analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u7684\u8868\u683c\u8fb9\u7f18\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u8868\u683c\u884c\u5217\u8f6c\u6362\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u4e00\u7ef4\u4fe1\u53f7\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u9ad8\u65af\u5377\u79ef\u4e0e\u7edf\u8ba1\u9608\u503c\u5316\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u683c\u7ed3\u6784\u63d0\u53d6\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6216\u566a\u58f0\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u68c0\u6d4b\u8868\u683c\u884c\u5217\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u4e14\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u8f93\u5165\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u800c\u4f20\u7edf\u63a9\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u654f\u611f\u3001\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u635f\u5931\u6216\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u8868\u683c\u884c\u5217\u8fb9\u754c\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u4e00\u7ef4\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9010\u6b65\u589e\u5927\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u5377\u79ef\u5e73\u6ed1\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u7edf\u8ba1\u9608\u503c\u5316\u6291\u5236\u566a\u58f0\u5e72\u6270\uff1b\u68c0\u6d4b\u4fe1\u53f7\u5cf0\u503c\u5e76\u6620\u5c04\u56de\u56fe\u50cf\u5750\u6807\u4ee5\u83b7\u53d6\u7ed3\u6784\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u96f6\u586b\u5145\u548c\u7f29\u653e\u7b56\u7565\u589e\u5f3a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728PubLayNet-1M\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408TableNet\u4e0ePyTesseract OCR\u7684Cell-Aware Segmentation Accuracy\uff08CASA\uff09\u4ece67%\u63d0\u5347\u81f376%\uff0c\u4e14\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u53d8\u5316\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u6587\u6863\u5206\u6790\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

We introduce TICON, a transformer-based tile representation contextualizer that produces rich, contextualized embeddings for ''any'' application in computational pathology. Standard tile encoder-based pipelines, which extract embeddings of tiles stripped from their context, fail to model the rich slide-level information essential for both local and global tasks. Furthermore, different tile-encoders excel at different downstream tasks. Therefore, a unified model is needed to contextualize embeddings derived from ''any'' tile-level foundation model. TICON addresses this need with a single, shared encoder, pretrained using a masked modeling objective to simultaneously unify and contextualize representations from diverse tile-level pathology foundation models. Our experiments demonstrate that TICON-contextualized embeddings significantly improve performance across many different tasks, establishing new state-of-the-art results on tile-level benchmarks (i.e., HEST-Bench, THUNDER, CATCH) and slide-level benchmarks (i.e., Patho-Bench).

The SAM2 pipelines typically propagate all visual tokens produced by the image encoder through downstream temporal reasoning modules, regardless of their relevance to the target object, resulting in reduced scalability due to quadratic memory attention overhead. In this work, we introduce a text-guided token pruning framework that improves inference efficiency by selectively reducing token density prior to temporal propagation, without modifying the underlying segmentation architecture. Operating after visual encoding and before memory based propagation, our method ranks tokens using a lightweight routing mechanism that integrates local visual context, semantic relevance derived from object-centric textual descriptions (either user-provided or automatically generated), and uncertainty cues that help preserve ambiguous or boundary critical regions. By retaining only the most informative tokens for downstream processing, the proposed approach reduces redundant computation while maintaining segmentation fidelity. Extensive experiments across multiple challenging video segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that post-encoder token pruning provides a practical and effective pathway to efficient, prompt-aware video segmentation, achieving up to 42.50 percent faster inference and 37.41 percent lower GPU memory usage compared to the unpruned baseline SAM2, while preserving competitive J and F performance.

To systematically investigate this, we introduce the largest open benchmark for this task: the YearGuessr dataset, a collection of 55,546 building images with multi-modal attributes from 157 countries, annotated with continuous ordinal labels of their construction year (1001-2024), GPS data, and page-view counts as a proxy for popularity. Using this dataset, we frame the construction year prediction task as ordinal regression and introduce popularity-aware interval accuracy metrics to quantify this bias. Our resulting benchmark of 30+ models, including our YearCLIP model, confirms that VLMs excel on popular, memorized items but struggle significantly with unrecognized subjects, exposing a critical flaw in their reasoning capabilities.
