As research increasingly leverages audio-visual materials to analyze the display of emotions, the emergence of multimodal generative AI promises great advances. However, we lack evidence about the effectiveness of multimodal AI in emotion analysis. This paper addresses this gap by evaluating current multimodal large language models (mLLMs) in video-based analysis of emotional arousal in two complementary data sets of human-labeled video recordings. I find that under ideal circumstances, mLLMs' emotional arousal ratings are highly reliable and show little to know indication of demographic bias. However, in recordings of speakers in real-world parliamentary debates, mLLMs' arousal ratings fail to deliver on this promise with potential negative consequences for downstream statistical inferences. This study therefore underscores the need for continued, thorough evaluation of emerging generative AI methods in political analysis and contributes a suitable replicable framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08mLLMs\uff09\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u60c5\u611f\u5524\u9192\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0cmLLMs\u5728\u7406\u60f3\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u65e0\u660e\u663e\u4eba\u53e3\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u8bae\u4f1a\u8fa9\u8bba\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u540e\u7eed\u7edf\u8ba1\u63a8\u65ad\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u6301\u7eed\u8bc4\u4f30\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5728\u653f\u6cbb\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u60c5\u611f\u5728\u653f\u6cbb\u4f20\u64ad\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u591a\u6a21\u6001AI\u6280\u672f\u5728\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u9700\u586b\u8865\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u7406\u60f3\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u8bae\u4f1a\u573a\u666f\uff09\u8bc4\u4f30\u73b0\u6709mLLMs\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u5524\u9192\u8bc4\u5206\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u60f3\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0bmLLMs\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u9ad8\u4e14\u57fa\u672c\u65e0\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4f46\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8bc4\u5206\u5931\u6548\u5e76\u5bfc\u81f4\u7edf\u8ba1\u63a8\u65ad\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u9700\u6301\u7eed\u4e25\u8c28\u8bc4\u4f30\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5728\u653f\u6cbb\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

However, applying RL to 3D generation remains largely unexplored due to the higher spatial complexity of 3D objects, which require globally consistent geometry and fine-grained local textures. This makes 3D generation significantly sensitive to reward designs and RL algorithms. To address these challenges, we conduct the first systematic study of RL for text-to-3D autoregressive generation across several dimensions. (1) Reward designs: We evaluate reward dimensions and model choices, showing that alignment with human preference is crucial, and that general multi-modal models provide robust signal for 3D attributes. (2) RL algorithms: We study GRPO variants, highlighting the effectiveness of token-level optimization, and further investigate the scaling of training data and iterations. (3) Text-to-3D Benchmarks: Since existing benchmarks fail to measure implicit reasoning abilities in 3D generation models, we introduce MME-3DR.

We further find that spatially fine-tuned models still fail to generalize effectively on our benchmark. Fine-grained error analysis exposes systematic failures in geometric reasoning, motion grounding, long-horizon prediction, and cross-video correspondence.

Therefore, these fragmented approaches are trained on disjoint slices of available 3D/4D data. We introduce OmniView, a unified framework that generalizes across a wide range of 4D consistency tasks. Our method separately represents space, time, and view conditions, enabling flexible combinations of these inputs. For example, OmniView can synthesize novel views from static, dynamic, and multiview inputs, extrapolate trajectories forward and backward in time, and create videos from text or image prompts with full camera control. OmniView is competitive with task-specific models across diverse benchmarks and metrics, improving image quality scores among camera-conditioned diffusion models by up to 33\\% in multiview NVS LLFF dataset, 60\\% in dynamic NVS Neural 3D Video benchmark, 20\\% in static camera control on RE-10K, and reducing camera trajectory errors by 4x in text-conditioned video generation.

Existing multimodal models exploring the potential of reasoning with images are brittle and do not scale. They rely on calling specialist tools, costly generation of images, or handcrafted reasoning data to switch between text and image thoughts. Instead, we offer a simpler alternative -- Mull-Tokens -- modality-agnostic latent tokens pre-trained to hold intermediate information in either image or text modalities to let the model think free-form towards the correct answer. We investigate best practices to train Mull-Tokens inspired by latent reasoning frameworks. We first train Mull-Tokens using supervision from interleaved text-image traces, and then fine-tune without any supervision by only using the final answers. Across four challenging spatial reasoning benchmarks involving tasks such as solving puzzles and taking different perspectives, we demonstrate that Mull-Tokens improve upon several baselines utilizing text-only reasoning or interleaved image-text reasoning, achieving a +3% average improvement and up to +16% on a puzzle solving reasoning-heavy split compared to our strongest baseline.

However, existing methods lack fine-grained temporal control over subject appearance and disappearance, which are essential for applications such as compositional video synthesis, storyboarding, and controllable animation. We propose AlcheMinT, a unified framework that introduces explicit timestamps conditioning for subject-driven video generation. Our approach introduces a novel positional encoding mechanism that unlocks the encoding of temporal intervals, associated in our case with subject identities, while seamlessly integrating with the pretrained video generation model positional embeddings. Additionally, we incorporate subject-descriptive text tokens to strengthen binding between visual identity and video captions, mitigating ambiguity during generation. Through token-wise concatenation, AlcheMinT avoids any additional cross-attention modules and incurs negligible parameter overhead. We establish a benchmark evaluating multiple subject identity preservation, video fidelity, and temporal adherence. Experimental results demonstrate that AlcheMinT achieves visual quality matching state-of-the-art video personalization methods, while, for the first time, enabling precise temporal control over multi-subject generation within videos.

Due to the lack of sufficient open-set de-occlusion and pose estimation priors, existing methods struggle to simultaneously produce high-quality geometry and accurate poses under severe occlusion and open-set settings. To address these issues, we first decouple the de-occlusion model from 3D object generation, and enhance it by leveraging image datasets and collected de-occlusion datasets for much more diverse open-set occlusion patterns. Then, we propose a unified pose estimation model that integrates global and local mechanisms for both self-attention and cross-attention to improve accuracy. Besides, we construct an open-set 3D scene dataset to further extend the generalization of the pose estimation model. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our decoupled framework on both indoor and open-set scenes.
