Abstract: Weakly supervised oriented object detection (WS-OOD) has gained attention as a cost-effective alternative to fully supervised methods, providing both efficiency and high accuracy. Among weakly supervised approaches, horizontal bounding box (HBox)-supervised OOD stands out for its ability to directly leverage existing HBox annotations while achieving the highest accuracy under weak supervision settings. This paper introduces adaptive bounding box scaling and symmetry-prior-based orientation prediction, called ABBSPO, a framework for WS-OOD. Our ABBSPO addresses limitations of previous HBox-supervised OOD methods, which compare ground truth (GT) HBoxes directly with the minimum circumscribed rectangles of predicted RBoxes, often leading to inaccurate scale estimation. To overcome this, we propose: (i) Adaptive Bounding Box Scaling (ABBS), which appropriately scales GT HBoxes to optimize for the size of each predicted RBox, ensuring more accurate scale prediction; and (ii) a Symmetric Prior Angle (SPA) loss that exploits inherent symmetry of aerial objects for self-supervised learning, resolving issues in previous methods where learning collapses when predictions for all three augmented views (original, rotated, and flipped) are consistently incorrect. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that ABBSPO achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods.

TL;DR: 结合扩散模型与自回归生成的图像描述新框架SST


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在视觉生成任务中有优秀表现，但未能在离散领域超越标准自回归模型。本文提出将扩散模型作为建议模块与自回归生成结合，融合双向细化能力与语言结构优势。

Method: 提出Show, Suggest and Tell (SST)框架，利用扩散模型生成建议向量辅助自回归解码器生成描述，同时保持语言结构并引入双向上下文信息。

Result: SST在COCO数据集上取得125.1 CIDEr-D得分（无强化学习），超越自回归和扩散模型SOTA结果1.5与2.5点，且实验证明建议模块与描述质量呈正相关。

Conclusion: 验证了扩散模型作为增强模块的可行性，揭示了结合双向建模与序列生成的潜力，为跨模态生成任务提供了新方向。

Abstract: Diffusion Denoising models demonstrated impressive results across generative Computer Vision tasks, but they still fail to outperform standard autoregressive solutions in the discrete domain, and only match them at best. In this work, we propose a different paradigm by adopting diffusion models to provide suggestions to the autoregressive generation rather than replacing them. By doing so, we combine the bidirectional and refining capabilities of the former with the strong linguistic structure provided by the latter. To showcase its effectiveness, we present Show, Suggest and Tell (SST), which achieves State-of-the-Art results on COCO, among models in a similar setting. In particular, SST achieves 125.1 CIDEr-D on the COCO dataset without Reinforcement Learning, outperforming both autoregressive and diffusion model State-of-the-Art results by 1.5 and 2.5 points. On top of the strong results, we performed extensive experiments to validate the proposal and analyze the impact of the suggestion module. Results demonstrate a positive correlation between suggestion and caption quality, overall indicating a currently underexplored but promising research direction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习模型受限于特定条件分布和单任务建模，需独立训练多个模型且缺乏灵活推理能力。

Method: 构建全变量联合扩散过程，通过生成式模型同时学习多模态数据（MRI+临床数据）的联合分布。

Result: 在10k+MRI数据上实验，MetaVoxel实现图像生成、年龄估计、性别预测，性能匹敌专用模型。

Conclusion: 联合多模态扩散模型可统一医学AI任务，提升模型泛化性和临床适用性。

Abstract: Modern deep learning methods have achieved impressive results across tasks from disease classification, estimating continuous biomarkers, to generating realistic medical images. Most of these approaches are trained to model conditional distributions defined by a specific predictive direction with a specific set of input variables. We introduce MetaVoxel, a generative joint diffusion modeling framework that models the joint distribution over imaging data and clinical metadata by learning a single diffusion process spanning all variables. By capturing the joint distribution, MetaVoxel unifies tasks that traditionally require separate conditional models and supports flexible zero-shot inference using arbitrary subsets of inputs without task-specific retraining. Using more than 10,000 T1-weighted MRI scans paired with clinical metadata from nine datasets, we show that a single MetaVoxel model can perform image generation, age estimation, and sex prediction, achieving performance comparable to established task-specific baselines. Additional experiments highlight its capabilities for flexible inference.Together, these findings demonstrate that joint multimodal diffusion offers a promising direction for unifying medical AI models and enabling broader clinical applicability.

### [4] [Independent Density Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10067)
*Jiahao Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出独立密度估计（IDE），通过建立单词与图像特征映射关系提升视觉语言模型的组合泛化能力，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型虽表现优异，但在学习人类语言与视觉的组合关系时存在泛化不足的问题，尤其在处理未见过的语义组合时效果欠佳。

Method: 1. 设计IDE方法，分别构建完全解耦特征输入模型和基于VAE的半解耦特征模型；2. 引入熵权重的组合推理机制，动态融合单词级预测结果。

Result: 在多个数据集上，IDE模型在未见过的组合任务（如新属性-对象搭配）中表现显著优于基线模型，验证了特征解耦与组合推理的有效性。

Conclusion: IDE通过显式建模语言-视觉对应关系与组合推理，为视觉语言任务提供了更鲁棒的泛化范式，推进了多模态认知一致性研究。

Abstract: Large-scale Vision-Language models have achieved remarkable results in various domains, such as image captioning and conditioned image generation. Neverthe- less, these models still encounter difficulties in achieving human-like composi- tional generalization. In this study, we propose a new method called Independent Density Estimation (IDE) to tackle this challenge. IDE aims to learn the connec- tion between individual words in a sentence and the corresponding features in an image, enabling compositional generalization. We build two models based on the philosophy of IDE. The first one utilizes fully disentangled visual representations as input, and the second leverages a Variational Auto-Encoder to obtain partially disentangled features from raw images. Additionally, we propose an entropy- based compositional inference method to combine predictions of each word in the sentence. Our models exhibit superior generalization to unseen compositions compared to current models when evaluated on various datasets.

Result: 在动态场景基准测试中，TraceFlow在PSNR、SSIM指标及视觉质量上均优于现有方法（如NeRF、Gaussian Splatting），显著提升动态镜面细节的真实感。

Conclusion: TraceFlow通过几何-材质联合建模与物理引导分量分解，实现了动态环境镜面反射渲染的最先进水平。

Abstract: We present TraceFlow, a novel framework for high-fidelity rendering of dynamic specular scenes by addressing two key challenges: precise reflection direction estimation and physically accurate reflection modeling. To achieve this, we propose a Residual Material-Augmented 2D Gaussian Splatting representation that models dynamic geometry and material properties, allowing accurate reflection ray computation. Furthermore, we introduce a Dynamic Environment Gaussian and a hybrid rendering pipeline that decomposes rendering into diffuse and specular components, enabling physically grounded specular synthesis via rasterization and ray tracing. Finally, we devise a coarse-to-fine training strategy to improve optimization stability and promote physically meaningful decomposition. Extensive experiments on dynamic scene benchmarks demonstrate that TraceFlow outperforms prior methods both quantitatively and qualitatively, producing sharper and more realistic specular reflections in complex dynamic environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deployment of deep neural networks (DNNs) on edge devices faces challenges in compute resources, latency, and privacy, necessitating split inference architectures between edge and cloud.

Method: Designed FCTM based on MPEG's Feature Coding for Machines (FCM) standard, optimizing bitstream syntax and codec pipeline for compressing intermediate DNN features.

Result: FCTM achieves 85.14% average bitrate reduction across multiple vision tasks compared to baseline methods, maintaining original model accuracy.

Conclusion: FCM standard enables scalable, interoperable deployment of intelligent features for bandwidth-limited and privacy-sensitive applications.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) drive modern machine vision but are challenging to deploy on edge devices due to high compute demands. Traditional approaches-running the full model on-device or offloading to the cloud face trade-offs in latency, bandwidth, and privacy. Splitting the inference workload between the edge and the cloud offers a balanced solution, but transmitting intermediate features to enable such splitting introduces new bandwidth challenges. To address this, the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) initiated the Feature Coding for Machines (FCM) standard, establishing a bitstream syntax and codec pipeline tailored for compressing intermediate features. This paper presents the design and performance of the Feature Coding Test Model (FCTM), showing significant bitrate reductions-averaging 85.14%-across multiple vision tasks while preserving accuracy. FCM offers a scalable path for efficient and interoperable deployment of intelligent features in bandwidth-limited and privacy-sensitive consumer applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出Latent-CoT-Drive，利用潜在语言替代自然语言实现自动驾驶的链式思考推理，通过动作提案与潜在世界模型结合，在大型驾驶数据集上实现了更快的推理速度和更优的轨迹质量。

Conclusion: 潜在语言的模态协同建模显著优于传统文本推理，揭示了多模态隐空间推理与决策的协同增益机制，为自动驾驶系统的实时性与安全性提供了新途径。

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for autonomous driving explore inference-time reasoning as a way to improve driving performance and safety in challenging scenarios. Most prior work uses natural language to express chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning before producing driving actions. However, text may not be the most efficient representation for reasoning. In this work, we present Latent-CoT-Drive (LCDrive): a model that expresses CoT in a latent language that captures possible outcomes of the driving actions being considered. Our approach unifies CoT reasoning and decision making by representing both in an action-aligned latent space. Instead of natural language, the model reasons by interleaving (1) action-proposal tokens, which use the same vocabulary as the model's output actions; and (2) world model tokens, which are grounded in a learned latent world model and express future outcomes of these actions. We cold start latent CoT by supervising the model's action proposals and world model tokens based on ground-truth future rollouts of the scene. We then post-train with closed-loop reinforcement learning to strengthen reasoning capabilities. On a large-scale end-to-end driving benchmark, LCDrive achieves faster inference, better trajectory quality, and larger improvements from interactive reinforcement learning compared to both non-reasoning and text-reasoning baselines.

### [9] [Emerging Standards for Machine-to-Machine Video Coding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10230)
*Md Eimran Hossain Eimon,Velibor Adzic,Hari Kalva,Borko Furht*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了机器间通信中视频编码的优化，提出VCM和FCM新标准以减少带宽并保护隐私，实验显示FCM维持任务准确性的同时大幅降低码率。



<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于像素的视频传输依赖于人类感知优化的编解码器，导致带宽占用高、扩展性差且隐私泄露。


Method: 提出任务感知编码VCM（像素域）和特征压缩编码FCM（中间神经特征），并以不同编解码器（HEVC/VVC/AVC）进行性能对比实验。


Result: FCM实现接近边缘推理的准确性，VVC与HEVC性能近似（BD-Rate差异1.39%），AVC相比VVC的BD-Rate增加32.28%，但跟踪任务中HEVC比VVC更优（BD-Rate -1.81%）。


Conclusion: FCM平衡了带宽效率与隐私保护，现有编解码器已能满足机器通信需求，验证了向新标准过渡的可行性。

Abstract: Machines are increasingly becoming the primary consumers of visual data, yet most deployments of machine-to-machine systems still rely on remote inference where pixel-based video is streamed using codecs optimized for human perception. Consequently, this paradigm is bandwidth intensive, scales poorly, and exposes raw images to third parties. Recent efforts in the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) redesigned the pipeline for machine-to-machine communication: Video Coding for Machines (VCM) is designed to apply task-aware coding tools in the pixel domain, and Feature Coding for Machines (FCM) is designed to compress intermediate neural features to reduce bitrate, preserve privacy, and support compute offload. Experiments show that FCM is capable of maintaining accuracy close to edge inference while significantly reducing bitrate. Additional analysis of H.26X codecs used as inner codecs in FCM reveals that H.265/High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) and H.266/Versatile Video Coding (VVC) achieve almost identical machine task performance, with an average BD-Rate increase of 1.39% when VVC is replaced with HEVC. In contrast, H.264/Advanced Video Coding (AVC) yields an average BD-Rate increase of 32.28% compared to VVC. However, for the tracking task, the impact of codec choice is minimal, with HEVC outperforming VVC and achieving BD Rate of -1.81% and 8.79% for AVC, indicating that existing hardware for already deployed codecs can support machine-to-machine communication without degrading performance.

### [10] [Multi-dimensional Preference Alignment by Conditioning Reward Itself](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10237)
*Jiho Jang,Jinyoung Kim,Kyungjune Baek,Nojun Kwak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MCDPO improves diffusion model alignment by addressing reward conflicts in standard DPO through a disentangled Bradley-Terry objective, enabling multi-axis optimization and dynamic inference control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard DPO's scalar reward aggregation causes conflicts where models unlearn desirable features in specific dimensions. This limits performance in multi-axis evaluations like aesthetic quality and semantic alignment.

Method: Proposed MCDPO introduces a disentangled Bradley-Terry objective with conditional preference vectors for independent axis optimization. Includes dimensional reward dropout to balance training. Uses Classifier-Free Guidance for inference-time reward dimension amplification.

Result: Experiments on Stable Diffusion 1.5/SDXL show superior benchmark performance. Achieves dynamic multi-axis control at inference without additional training. Maintains feature quality across diverse evaluation dimensions.

Conclusion: MCDPO resolves reward conflicts in multi-axis alignment of diffusion models. Enables balanced learning and flexible inference control, outperforming baseline methods in both performance and adaptability.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback has emerged as a standard for aligning diffusion models. However, we identify a fundamental limitation in the standard DPO formulation because it relies on the Bradley-Terry model to aggregate diverse evaluation axes like aesthetic quality and semantic alignment into a single scalar reward. This aggregation creates a reward conflict where the model is forced to unlearn desirable features of a specific dimension if they appear in a globally non-preferred sample. To address this issue, we propose Multi Reward Conditional DPO (MCDPO). This method resolves reward conflicts by introducing a disentangled Bradley-Terry objective. MCDPO explicitly injects a preference outcome vector as a condition during training, which allows the model to learn the correct optimization direction for each reward axis independently within a single network. We further introduce dimensional reward dropout to ensure balanced optimization across dimensions. Extensive experiments on Stable Diffusion 1.5 and SDXL demonstrate that MCDPO achieves superior performance on benchmarks. Notably, our conditional framework enables dynamic and multiple-axis control at inference time using Classifier Free Guidance to amplify specific reward dimensions without additional training or external reward models.

### [11] [Solving Semi-Supervised Few-Shot Learning from an Auto-Annotation Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10244)
*Tian Liu,Anwesha Basu,James Caverlee,Shu Kong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为SWIFT（Stage-Wise Finetuning with Temperature Tuning）的方法，在有限标注数据和大量未标注数据的条件下，通过优化视觉语言模型（VLM）的伪标签置信度和监督信号，显著提升了半监督少样本学习（SSFSL）性能，超越现有方法约5个准确率点，甚至接近全监督学习表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前SSFSL研究未充分利用公开可用的视觉语言模型（VLM）及其预训练数据，而相关领域少样本学习（FSL）已通过利用这些资源提升性能。作者旨在探索如何在SSFSL中有效整合开放资源以实现真实场景的自动标注。

Method: 首先发现直接应用SSL方法微调VLM表现不佳，归因于VLM输出的softmax分布过于平坦导致伪标签失效。提出两种简单技术：分类器初始化和温度系数调整联合增强伪标签置信度，并结合阶段式微调形成SWIFT框架，允许在有限标注数据、大量未标注数据及预训练集噪音数据中有效优化VLM。

Result: 在5个SSFSL基准测试中，SWIFT对比特最新FSL/SSL方法提升约5%准确率，性能逼近需使用真实标签微调的全监督学习方法，并成功揭示了提升未标注数据利用率与监督信号强度的关键机制。

Conclusion: 研究证实基于VLM的SSFSL性能受限于伪标签质量而非方法本身，通过简单工程改进即可突破性能瓶颈，为实际应用中如何结合开放资源与半监督学习提供了高效可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Semi-supervised few-shot learning (SSFSL) formulates real-world applications like ''auto-annotation'', as it aims to learn a model over a few labeled and abundant unlabeled examples to annotate the unlabeled ones. Despite the availability of powerful open-source Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and their pretraining data, the SSFSL literature largely neglects these open-source resources. In contrast, the related area few-shot learning (FSL) has already exploited them to boost performance. Arguably, to achieve auto-annotation in the real world, SSFSL should leverage such open-source resources. To this end, we start by applying established SSL methods to finetune a VLM. Counterintuitively, they significantly underperform FSL baselines. Our in-depth analysis reveals the root cause: VLMs produce rather ''flat'' distributions of softmax probabilities. This results in zero utilization of unlabeled data and weak supervision signals. We address this issue with embarrassingly simple techniques: classifier initialization and temperature tuning. They jointly increase the confidence scores of pseudo-labels, improving the utilization rate of unlabeled data, and strengthening supervision signals. Building on this, we propose: Stage-Wise Finetuning with Temperature Tuning (SWIFT), which enables existing SSL methods to effectively finetune a VLM on limited labeled data, abundant unlabeled data, and task-relevant but noisy data retrieved from the VLM's pretraining set. Extensive experiments on five SSFSL benchmarks show that SWIFT outperforms recent FSL and SSL methods by $\sim$5 accuracy points. SWIFT even rivals supervised learning, which finetunes VLMs with the unlabeled data being labeled with ground truth!

### [12] [RobustSora: De-Watermarked Benchmark for Robust AI-Generated Video Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10248)
*Zhuo Wang,Xiliang Liu,Ligang Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces RobustSora, a benchmark for evaluating watermark robustness in AI-generated video detection, revealing that detectors partially rely on watermarks and performance drops when watermark patterns are manipulated.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AIGC video detection benchmarks ignore the impact of digital watermarks embedded in generative models, which may skew detection results. This work aims to systematically assess this dependency and improve detection robustness.

Method: Constructing a controlled dataset (6,500 videos) with four categories (A-C, A-S, G-W, G-DeW) and two evaluation tasks (watermark-removed AI videos and false alarms from fake watermarks). Testbed includes 10 SOTA models (AIGC detectors, transformers, MLLMs) to measure performance variations.

Result: Models show 2-8% performance degradation under watermark manipulation. Transformers exhibit moderate watermark dependency (6-8%), while MLLMs show inconsistent patterns (2-8%). Detectors struggle with de-watermarked AI videos and falsely flag watermarked authentic videos.

Conclusion: Existing AIGC detectors partially rely on watermarks for detection, highlighting risks of overfitting. The study emphasizes the necessity of watermark-aware training strategies and robust evaluation protocols (like RobustSora) for reliable AIGC detection.

Abstract: The proliferation of AI-generated video technologies poses challenges to information integrity. While recent benchmarks advance AIGC video detection, they overlook a critical factor: many state-of-the-art generative models embed digital watermarks in outputs, and detectors may partially rely on these patterns. To evaluate this influence, we present RobustSora, the benchmark designed to assess watermark robustness in AIGC video detection. We systematically construct a dataset of 6,500 videos comprising four types: Authentic-Clean (A-C), Authentic-Spoofed with fake watermarks (A-S), Generated-Watermarked (G-W), and Generated-DeWatermarked (G-DeW). Our benchmark introduces two evaluation tasks: Task-I tests performance on watermark-removed AI videos, while Task-II assesses false alarm rates on authentic videos with fake watermarks. Experiments with ten models spanning specialized AIGC detectors, transformer architectures, and MLLM approaches reveal performance variations of 2-8pp under watermark manipulation. Transformer-based models show consistent moderate dependency (6-8pp), while MLLMs exhibit diverse patterns (2-8pp). These findings indicate partial watermark dependency and highlight the need for watermark-aware training strategies. RobustSora provides essential tools to advance robust AIGC detection research.

*Eunho Lee,Chaehyeon Song,Seunghoon Jeong,Ayoung Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: THE-Pose框架通过拓扑先验和混合图融合显著提升类别级6D姿态估计性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D图卷积方法依赖局部几何和深度信息，在复杂物体和视觉模糊场景下鲁棒性不足，需结合全局上下文与局部结构。

Method: 提出表面嵌入生成拓扑特征，并设计混合图融合模块(HGF)，自适应整合2D图像拓扑与3D点云特征。

Result: 在REAL275数据集实验表明THE-Pose较3D-GC基准方法(HS-Pose)提升35.8%，超过SOTA方法7.2%，在遮挡场景下表现稳定。

Conclusion: 拓扑特征与3D几何结构的融合有效缓解了局部几何方法的局限性，代码已开源。

Abstract: Category-level object pose estimation requires both global context and local structure to ensure robustness against intra-class variations. However, 3D graph convolution (3D-GC) methods only focus on local geometry and depth information, making them vulnerable to complex objects and visual ambiguities. To address this, we present THE-Pose, a novel category-level 6D pose estimation framework that leverages a topological prior via surface embedding and hybrid graph fusion. Specifically, we extract consistent and invariant topological features from the image domain, effectively overcoming the limitations inherent in existing 3D-GC based methods. Our Hybrid Graph Fusion (HGF) module adaptively integrates the topological features with point-cloud features, seamlessly bridging 2D image context and 3D geometric structure. These fused features ensure stability for unseen or complicated objects, even under significant occlusions. Extensive experiments on the REAL275 dataset show that THE-Pose achieves a 35.8% improvement over the 3D-GC baseline (HS-Pose) and surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by 7.2% across all key metrics. The code is avaialbe on https://github.com/EHxxx/THE-Pose

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超声心动图视频分割对临床诊断至关重要，但现有方法在长程时空依赖建模与计算效率之间难以平衡，且存在噪声与边界模糊问题。

Method: 采用线性键值关联（LKVA）建模帧间相关性，门控增量规则（GDR）存储中间状态，并通过多尺度键像素特征融合（KPFF）整合局部与全局特征。

Conclusion: GDKVM在保持高精度的同时满足临床实时需求，为超声心动图分析提供了新的技术框架。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of cardiac chambers in echocardiography sequences is crucial for the quantitative analysis of cardiac function, aiding in clinical diagnosis and treatment. The imaging noise, artifacts, and the deformation and motion of the heart pose challenges to segmentation algorithms. While existing methods based on convolutional neural networks, Transformers, and space-time memory networks have improved segmentation accuracy, they often struggle with the trade-off between capturing long-range spatiotemporal dependencies and maintaining computational efficiency with fine-grained feature representation. In this paper, we introduce GDKVM, a novel architecture for echocardiography video segmentation. The model employs Linear Key-Value Association (LKVA) to effectively model inter-frame correlations, and introduces Gated Delta Rule (GDR) to efficiently store intermediate memory states. Key-Pixel Feature Fusion (KPFF) module is designed to integrate local and global features at multiple scales, enhancing robustness against boundary blurring and noise interference. We validated GDKVM on two mainstream echocardiography video datasets (CAMUS and EchoNet-Dynamic) and compared it with various state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results show that GDKVM outperforms existing approaches in terms of segmentation accuracy and robustness, while ensuring real-time performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NCD方法依赖视觉特征导致特征区分度不足且受数据长尾分布限制，且缺乏对文本语义的利用。

Method: 提出多模态框架LLM-NCD：1) 联合优化已知类别图像与文本特征生成聚类中心语义原型；2) 双阶段发现机制通过语义相似度阈值动态分离已知与未知样本，进行自适应聚类。

Result: 在CIFAR-100数据集上较现有方法提升25.3%未知类分类准确率，并首次实现对长尾分布数据的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 多模态语义融合与原型引导聚类可有效解决NCD任务的特征表达局限性问题，为长尾数据场景提供新范式。

Abstract: Novel Class Discovery aims to utilise prior knowledge of known classes to classify and discover unknown classes from unlabelled data. Existing NCD methods for images primarily rely on visual features, which suffer from limitations such as insufficient feature discriminability and the long-tail distribution of data. We propose LLM-NCD, a multimodal framework that breaks this bottleneck by fusing visual-textual semantics and prototype guided clustering. Our key innovation lies in modelling cluster centres and semantic prototypes of known classes by jointly optimising known class image and text features, and a dualphase discovery mechanism that dynamically separates known or novel samples via semantic affinity thresholds and adaptive clustering. Experiments on the CIFAR-100 dataset show that compared to the current methods, this method achieves up to 25.3% improvement in accuracy for unknown classes. Notably, our method shows unique resilience to long tail distributions, a first in NCD literature.

*Hongsin Lee,Hye Won Chung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出Sample-wise Adaptive Adversarial Distillation（SAAD），通过动态调整对抗样本权重解决鲁棒性迁移中的鲁棒饱和问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗蒸馏方法未利用先进的鲁棒教师模型，且鲁棒饱和现象提示需关注对抗迁移性对鲁棒性传递的影响。

Method: 基于对抗转移性（学生生成对抗样本的有效性）评估学生与教师模型间的样本对齐度，对训练样本进行加权，无需额外计算成本。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和Tiny-ImageNet数据上，SAAD在AutoAttack鲁棒性指标上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 对抗迁移性是鲁棒性转移的核心因素，SAAD通过自适应样本加权有效提升学生模型鲁棒性。

Abstract: Adversarial distillation in the standard min-max adversarial training framework aims to transfer adversarial robustness from a large, robust teacher network to a compact student. However, existing work often neglects to incorporate state-of-the-art robust teachers. Through extensive analysis, we find that stronger teachers do not necessarily yield more robust students-a phenomenon known as robust saturation. While typically attributed to capacity gaps, we show that such explanations are incomplete. Instead, we identify adversarial transferability-the fraction of student-crafted adversarial examples that remain effective against the teacher-as a key factor in successful robustness transfer. Based on this insight, we propose Sample-wise Adaptive Adversarial Distillation (SAAD), which reweights training examples by their measured transferability without incurring additional computational cost. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet show that SAAD consistently improves AutoAttack robustness over prior methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/HongsinLee/saad.

TL;DR: MotionEdit是一个运动中心的图像编辑数据集和评估基准，MotionNFT框架通过运动对齐奖励提高了现有模型的运动编辑能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像编辑数据集主要关注静态外观变化或包含低质量运动编辑，运动编辑任务在科学和应用层面都具有挑战性，需要高质量数据集和系统性评估方案

Method: 构建包含高保真运动变换图像对的MotionEdit数据集，并设计多维度评估指标的MotionEdit-Bench基准。提出MotionNFT框架，通过计算生成图像与真实运动流的对齐程度作为奖励引导模型训练

Result: 基准测试表明现有扩散模型在运动编辑任务效果有限，MotionNFT在FLUX.1和Qwen-Image-Edit模型上显著提升运动保真度，且不损失通用编辑能力

Conclusion: MotionEdit为运动编辑任务提供标准化数据集和评估方案，MotionNFT通过运动感知强化学习有效解决该任务的技术缺口

Abstract: We introduce MotionEdit, a novel dataset for motion-centric image editing-the task of modifying subject actions and interactions while preserving identity, structure, and physical plausibility. Unlike existing image editing datasets that focus on static appearance changes or contain only sparse, low-quality motion edits, MotionEdit provides high-fidelity image pairs depicting realistic motion transformations extracted and verified from continuous videos. This new task is not only scientifically challenging but also practically significant, powering downstream applications such as frame-controlled video synthesis and animation.
  To evaluate model performance on the novel task, we introduce MotionEdit-Bench, a benchmark that challenges models on motion-centric edits and measures model performance with generative, discriminative, and preference-based metrics. Benchmark results reveal that motion editing remains highly challenging for existing state-of-the-art diffusion-based editing models. To address this gap, we propose MotionNFT (Motion-guided Negative-aware Fine Tuning), a post-training framework that computes motion alignment rewards based on how well the motion flow between input and model-edited images matches the ground-truth motion, guiding models toward accurate motion transformations. Extensive experiments on FLUX.1 Kontext and Qwen-Image-Edit show that MotionNFT consistently improves editing quality and motion fidelity of both base models on the motion editing task without sacrificing general editing ability, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Motivation: 现有研究过度关注低层次视觉一致性，忽视镜头过渡设计与电影语言对叙事表达的作用，导致视频生成缺乏专业剪辑模式。

Method: 1) 相机控制模块注入6-DoF姿态和内参参数；2) 分层掩码机制引入专业编辑模式提示；3) 构建ShotWeaver40K数据集并开发可控性评估指标体系。

Result: 实验验证了框架在生成电影化镜头过渡中的有效性，较现有方法显著提升了视觉叙事表达的可控性。

Conclusion: ShotDirector成功结合参数化条件与高层语义引导，为可控制多镜头视频生成提供了新的技术路径和数据基准。

Abstract: Shot transitions play a pivotal role in multi-shot video generation, as they determine the overall narrative expression and the directorial design of visual storytelling. However, recent progress has primarily focused on low-level visual consistency across shots, neglecting how transitions are designed and how cinematographic language contributes to coherent narrative expression. This often leads to mere sequential shot changes without intentional film-editing patterns. To address this limitation, we propose ShotDirector, an efficient framework that integrates parameter-level camera control and hierarchical editing-pattern-aware prompting. Specifically, we adopt a camera control module that incorporates 6-DoF poses and intrinsic settings to enable precise camera information injection. In addition, a shot-aware mask mechanism is employed to introduce hierarchical prompts aware of professional editing patterns, allowing fine-grained control over shot content. Through this design, our framework effectively combines parameter-level conditions with high-level semantic guidance, achieving film-like controllable shot transitions. To facilitate training and evaluation, we construct ShotWeaver40K, a dataset that captures the priors of film-like editing patterns, and develop a set of evaluation metrics for controllable multi-shot video generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.

Conclusion: 高效内存架构与混合训练策略的结合可显著降低视觉-语言导航模型的训练成本，同时保持甚至提升任务完成率，为多模态交互场景提供实用化解决方案

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promising potential in Vision-Language Navigation (VLN). However, their practical development is severely hindered by the substantial training overhead. We recognize two key issues that contribute to the overhead: (1) the quadratic computational burden from processing long-horizon historical observations as massive sequences of tokens, and (2) the exploration-efficiency trade-off in DAgger, i.e., a data aggregation process of collecting agent-explored trajectories. While more exploration yields effective error-recovery trajectories for handling test-time distribution shifts, it comes at the cost of longer trajectory lengths for both training and inference. To address these challenges, we propose Efficient-VLN, a training-efficient VLN model. Specifically, to mitigate the token processing burden, we design two efficient memory mechanisms: a progressive memory that dynamically allocates more tokens to recent observations, and a learnable recursive memory that utilizes the key-value cache of learnable tokens as the memory state. Moreover, we introduce a dynamic mixed policy to balance the exploration-efficiency trade-off. Extensive experiments show that Efficient-VLN achieves state-of-the-art performance on R2R-CE (64.2% SR) and RxR-CE (67.0% SR). Critically, our model consumes merely 282 H800 GPU hours, demonstrating a dramatic reduction in training overhead compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) in histopathology seeks to reduce annotation cost by learning from image-level labels, yet it remains limited by inter-class homogeneity, intra-class heterogeneity, and the region-shrinkage effect of CAM-based supervision. We propose a simple and effective prototype-driven framework that leverages vision-language alignment to improve region discovery under weak supervision. Our method integrates CoOp-style learnable prompt tuning to generate text-based prototypes and combines them with learnable image prototypes, forming a dual-modal prototype bank that captures both semantic and appearance cues. To address oversmoothing in ViT representations, we incorporate a multi-scale pyramid module that enhances spatial precision and improves localization quality. Experiments on the BCSS-WSSS benchmark show that our approach surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods, and detailed analyses demonstrate the benefits of text description diversity, context length, and the complementary behavior of text and image prototypes. These results highlight the effectiveness of jointly leveraging textual semantics and visual prototype learning for WSSS in digital pathology.

Conclusion: 结合视觉-语言对齐与分割模型的空间线索的框架能显著提升弱监督下病理图像的分割性能，为无需密集标注的方案提供可行性。

Abstract: Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) in histopathology relies heavily on classification backbones, yet these models often localize only the most discriminative regions and struggle to capture the full spatial extent of tissue structures. Vision-language models such as CONCH offer rich semantic alignment and morphology-aware representations, while modern segmentation backbones like SegFormer preserve fine-grained spatial cues. However, combining these complementary strengths remains challenging, especially under weak supervision and without dense annotations. We propose a prototype learning framework for WSSS in histopathological images that integrates morphology-aware representations from CONCH, multi-scale structural cues from SegFormer, and text-guided semantic alignment to produce prototypes that are simultaneously semantically discriminative and spatially coherent. To effectively leverage these heterogeneous sources, we introduce text-guided prototype initialization that incorporates pathology descriptions to generate more complete and semantically accurate pseudo-masks. A structural distillation mechanism transfers spatial knowledge from SegFormer to preserve fine-grained morphological patterns and local tissue boundaries during prototype learning. Our approach produces high-quality pseudo masks without pixel-level annotations, improves localization completeness, and enhances semantic consistency across tissue types. Experiments on BCSS-WSSS datasets demonstrate that our prototype learning framework outperforms existing WSSS methods while remaining computationally efficient through frozen foundation model backbones and lightweight trainable adapters.

Abstract: We propose a novel generative approach for 3D human pose estimation. 3D human pose estimation poses several key challenges due to the complex geometry of the human body, self-occluding joints, and the requirement for large-scale real-world motion datasets. To address these challenges, we introduce Point2Pose, a framework that effectively models the distribution of human poses conditioned on sequential point cloud and pose history. Specifically, we employ a spatio-temporal point cloud encoder and a pose feature encoder to extract joint-wise features, followed by an attention-based generative regressor. Additionally, we present a large-scale indoor dataset MVPose3D, which contains multiple modalities, including IMU data of non-trivial human motions, dense multi-view point clouds, and RGB images. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the baseline models, demonstrating its superior performance across various datasets.

Motivation: 传统单模态token压缩方法无法利用音视频跨模态协同，音频和视频动态信息密度差异导致固定token分配策略低效，联合压缩方法存在研究空白。

Method: 1.提出CS²模块实现音视频联合token池的协同压缩，动态分配token预算；2.设计Sync-RoPE保持时间关系建模能力，确保压缩后的时序一致性。

Conclusion: 跨模态协同压缩机制有效解决音视频联合token压缩难题，通过动态预算分配和时间关系维护，在效率与性能间取得均衡。

Abstract: Audio-Visual Large Language Models (AV-LLMs) face prohibitive computational overhead from massive audio and video tokens. Token reduction, while extensively explored for video-only LLMs, is insufficient for the audio-visual domain, as these unimodal methods cannot leverage audio-visual cross-modal synergies. Furthermore, the distinct and dynamic information densities of audio and video render static budgets per modality suboptimal. How to perform token reduction on a joint audio-visual stream thus remains an unaddressed bottleneck. To fill this gap, we introduce EchoingPixels, a framework inspired by the coexistence and interaction of visuals and sound in real-world scenes. The core of our framework is the Cross-Modal Semantic Sieve (CS2), a module enabling early audio-visual interaction. Instead of compressing modalities independently, CS2 co-attends to the joint multimodal stream and reduces tokens from an entire combined pool of audio-visual tokens rather than using fixed budgets per modality. This single-pool approach allows it to adaptively allocate the token budget across both modalities and dynamically identify salient tokens in concert. To ensure this aggressive reduction preserves the vital temporal modeling capability, we co-design a Synchronization-Augmented RoPE (Sync-RoPE) to maintain critical temporal relationships for the sparsely selected tokens. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EchoingPixels achieves performance comparable to strong baselines using only 5-20% of the original tokens, with a 2-3x speedup and memory reduction.

Conclusion: StainNet填补了特殊染色病理图像分析的模型空白，开源权重(https://huggingface.co/JWonderLand/StainNet)将推动相关领域发展

Abstract: Foundation models trained with self-supervised learning (SSL) on large-scale histological images have significantly accelerated the development of computational pathology. These models can serve as backbones for region-of-interest (ROI) image analysis or patch-level feature extractors in whole-slide images (WSIs) based on multiple instance learning (MIL). Existing pathology foundation models (PFMs) are typically pre-trained on Hematoxylin-Eosin (H&E) stained pathology images. However, images with special stains, such as immunohistochemistry, are also frequently used in clinical practice. PFMs pre-trained mainly on H\&E-stained images may be limited in clinical applications involving special stains. To address this issue, we propose StainNet, a specialized foundation model for special stains based on the vision transformer (ViT) architecture. StainNet adopts a self-distillation SSL approach and is trained on over 1.4 million patch images cropping from 20,231 publicly available special staining WSIs in the HISTAI database. To evaluate StainNet, we conduct experiments on an in-house slide-level liver malignancy classification task and two public ROI-level datasets to demonstrate its strong ability. We also perform few-ratio learning and retrieval evaluations, and compare StainNet with recently larger PFMs to further highlight its strengths. We have released the StainNet model weights at: https://huggingface.co/JWonderLand/StainNet.

Abstract: Real-World Image Super-Resolution (Real-ISR) aims to recover high-quality images from low-quality inputs degraded by unknown and complex real-world factors. Real-world scenarios involve diverse and coupled degradations, making it necessary to provide diffusion models with richer and more informative guidance. However, existing methods often assume known degradation severity and rely on CLIP text encoders that cannot capture numerical severity, limiting their generalization ability. To address this, we propose \textbf{HD-CLIP} (\textbf{H}ierarchical \textbf{D}egradation CLIP), which decomposes a low-quality image into a semantic embedding and an ordinal degradation embedding that captures ordered relationships and allows interpolation across unseen levels. Furthermore, we integrated it into diffusion models via classifier-free guidance (CFG) and proposed classifier-free projection guidance (CFPG). HD-CLIP leverages semantic cues to guide generative restoration while using degradation cues to suppress undesired hallucinations and artifacts. As a \textbf{plug-and-play module}, HD-CLIP can be seamlessly integrated into various super-resolution frameworks without training, significantly improving detail fidelity and perceptual realism across diverse real-world datasets.

Method: 提出场景图增量更新（SGI）方法，通过逐步更新输入场景图生成中间推理步骤，结合思维链（CoT）和场景图技术，无需训练即可辅助模型推理。

Result: SGI在CoSPlan基准上平均提升5.2%性能，显著增强VLMs（如Intern-VLM、Qwen2）的错误修正能力，并成功泛化到传统规划任务（如Plan-Bench、VQA）。

Conclusion: SGI方法有效解决了VLMs在视觉序列规划中的纠错难题，为复杂任务的实用化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit impressive complex reasoning capabilities but remain largely unexplored in visual sequential planning, i.e., executing multi-step actions towards a goal. Additionally, practical sequential planning often involves non-optimal (erroneous) steps, challenging VLMs to detect and correct such steps. We propose Corrective Sequential Planning Benchmark (CoSPlan) to evaluate VLMs in error-prone, vision-based sequential planning tasks across 4 domains: maze navigation, block rearrangement, image reconstruction,and object reorganization. CoSPlan assesses two key abilities: Error Detection (identifying non-optimal action) and Step Completion (correcting and completing action sequences to reach the goal). Despite using state-of-the-art reasoning techniques such as Chain-of-Thought and Scene Graphs, VLMs (e.g. Intern-VLM and Qwen2) struggle on CoSPlan, failing to leverage contextual cues to reach goals. Addressing this, we propose a novel training-free method, Scene Graph Incremental updates (SGI), which introduces intermediate reasoning steps between the initial and goal states. SGI helps VLMs reason about sequences, yielding an average performance gain of 5.2%. In addition to enhancing reliability in corrective sequential planning, SGI generalizes to traditional planning tasks such as Plan-Bench and VQA.

Abstract: Motion generation is fundamental to computer animation and widely used across entertainment, robotics, and virtual environments. While recent methods achieve impressive results, most rely on fixed skeletal templates, which prevent them from generalizing to skeletons with different or perturbed topologies. We address the core limitation of current motion generation methods - the combined lack of large-scale heterogeneous animal motion data and unified generative frameworks capable of jointly modeling arbitrary skeletal topologies and textual conditions. To this end, we introduce OmniZoo, a large-scale animal motion dataset spanning 140 species and 32,979 sequences, enriched with multimodal annotations. Building on OmniZoo, we propose a generalized autoregressive motion generation framework capable of producing text-driven motions for arbitrary skeletal topologies. Central to our model is a Topology-aware Skeleton Embedding Module that encodes geometric and structural properties of any skeleton into a shared token space, enabling seamless fusion with textual semantics. Given a text prompt and a target skeleton, our method generates temporally coherent, physically plausible, and semantically aligned motions, and further enables cross-species motion style transfer.

Abstract: Weakly supervised semantic segmentation offers a label-efficient solution to train segmentation models for volumetric medical imaging. However, existing approaches often rely on 2D encoders that neglect the inherent volumetric nature of the data. We propose TranSamba, a hybrid Transformer-Mamba architecture designed to capture 3D context for weakly supervised volumetric medical segmentation. TranSamba augments a standard Vision Transformer backbone with Cross-Plane Mamba blocks, which leverage the linear complexity of state space models for efficient information exchange across neighboring slices. The information exchange enhances the pairwise self-attention within slices computed by the Transformer blocks, directly contributing to the attention maps for object localization. TranSamba achieves effective volumetric modeling with time complexity that scales linearly with the input volume depth and maintains constant memory usage for batch processing. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that TranSamba establishes new state-of-the-art performance, consistently outperforming existing methods across diverse modalities and pathologies.

*Tarik Reza Toha,Shao-Jung,Lu,Shahriar Nirjon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: mmCounter通过提取超低频信号（<1Hz）和创新信号处理技术，在密集室内空间准确计数静止人群，突破传统毫米波雷达依赖运动检测的局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有毫米波雷达难以检测密集静态人群，因为空间分辨率不足且依赖移动检测。此外，呼吸频率估计等现有研究需预知人数，与本研究问题存在本质差异。

Method: 提取来自呼吸和微小躯干移动的<1Hz超低频信号，设计多阶段信号处理流程分离信号源并映射到个体，结合空域信息实现计数。

Result: 87%平均F1分数、0.6平均绝对误差（熟悉环境）；60% F1、1.1误差（新环境）。可在3平方米空间内计数7人（无横向间距，纵向间隔1米）

Conclusion: 通过超低频生物信号和空间分析突破静态人群计数瓶颈，性能显著优于需预知人数的传统方法，验证了毫米波雷达在高密度静态场景下的可行性。

Abstract: mmWave radars struggle to detect or count individuals in dense, static (non-moving) groups due to limitations in spatial resolution and reliance on movement for detection. We present mmCounter, which accurately counts static people in dense indoor spaces (up to three people per square meter). mmCounter achieves this by extracting ultra-low frequency (< 1 Hz) signals, primarily from breathing and micro-scale body movements such as slight torso shifts, and applying novel signal processing techniques to differentiate these subtle signals from background noise and nearby static objects. Our problem differs significantly from existing studies on breathing rate estimation, which assume the number of people is known a priori. In contrast, mmCounter utilizes a novel multi-stage signal processing pipeline to extract relevant low-frequency sources along with their spatial information and map these sources to individual people, enabling accurate counting. Extensive evaluations in various environments demonstrate that mmCounter delivers an 87% average F1 score and 0.6 mean absolute error in familiar environments, and a 60% average F1 score and 1.1 mean absolute error in previously untested environments. It can count up to seven individuals in a three square meter space, such that there is no side-by-side spacing and only a one-meter front-to-back distance.

Abstract: Video Question Answering (VideoQA) task serves as a critical playground for evaluating whether foundation models can effectively perceive, understand, and reason about dynamic real-world scenarios. However, existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with simultaneously modeling spatial relationships within video frames and understanding the causal dynamics of temporal evolution on complex and reasoning-intensive VideoQA task. In this work, we equip MLLM with a comprehensive and extensible Video Toolkit, to enhance MLLM's spatiotemporal reasoning capabilities and ensure the harmony between the quantity and diversity of tools. To better control the tool invocation sequence and avoid toolchain shortcut issues, we propose a Spatiotemporal Reasoning Framework (STAR) that strategically schedules temporal and spatial tools, thereby progressively localizing the key area in the video. Our STAR framework enhances GPT-4o using lightweight tools, achieving an 8.2% gain on VideoMME and 4.6% on LongVideoBench. We believe that our proposed Video Toolkit and STAR framework make an important step towards building autonomous and intelligent video analysis assistants.

*Woojun Jung,Jaehoon Go,Mingyu Jeon,Sunjae Yoon,Junyeong Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Visual Funnel缓解多模态大语言模型的‘上下文盲’问题，通过结构化图像裁剪提升上下文与细节的融合能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM在处理细粒度视觉任务时存在‘上下文盲’问题，根源在于高保真细节与全局语境的结构断层，而非信息量不足。

Method: Visual Funnel分两步：1）通过上下文锚定单次前向推理定位关键区域；2）基于注意力熵构建动态尺寸的多裁剪框组合，保留从焦点到广域的层次化上下文。

Result: 实验表明该方法显著优于单裁剪/无结构多裁剪基线，证明结构多样性比单纯增加裁剪数量更有效。

Conclusion: 证明上下文盲问题可通过输入结构优化解决，提出的训练无关方法为MLLM视觉理解提供新范式。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate impressive reasoning capabilities, but often fail to perceive fine-grained visual details, limiting their applicability in precision-demanding tasks. While methods that crop salient regions of an image offer a partial solution, we identify a critical limitation they introduce: "Contextual Blindness". This failure occurs due to structural disconnect between high-fidelity details (from the crop) and the broader global context (from the original image), even when all necessary visual information is present. We argue that this limitation stems not from a lack of information 'Quantity', but from a lack of 'Structural Diversity' in the model's input. To resolve this, we propose Visual Funnel, a training-free, two-step approach. Visual Funnel first performs Contextual Anchoring to identify the region of interest in a single forward pass. It then constructs an Entropy-Scaled Portfolio that preserves the hierarchical context - ranging from focal detail to broader surroundings - by dynamically determining crop sizes based on attention entropy and refining crop centers. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that Visual Funnel significantly outperforms naive single-crop and unstructured multi-crop baselines. Our results further validate that simply adding more unstructured crops provides limited or even detrimental benefits, confirming that the hierarchical structure of our portfolio is key to resolving Contextual Blindness.

Motivation: 受限于长视频单次处理的计算不可行性，现有零样本方法在搜索阶段面临候选膨胀，在精炼阶段依赖高成本模型验证。监督方法则扩展性差且泛化能力弱。

Method: 提出P2S框架：1) 自适应片段生成器基于查询意图动态调整候选区间，避免指数级候选膨胀；2) 查询分解技术将自然语言查询拆解为语义约束组合，直接通过跨模态匹配进行候选筛选，无需使用高成本视觉语言模型(VLMs)验证。

Conclusion: P2S首次实现了无需训练、无需验证模型的零样本长视频检索，同时解决效率瓶颈与成本问题，在跨领域长视频分析中具有普适性应用潜力。

Abstract: Zero-shot Long Video Moment Retrieval (ZLVMR) is the task of identifying temporal segments in hour-long videos using a natural language query without task-specific training. The core technical challenge of LVMR stems from the computational infeasibility of processing entire lengthy videos in a single pass. This limitation has established a 'Search-then-Refine' approach, where candidates are rapidly narrowed down, and only those portions are analyzed, as the dominant paradigm for LVMR. However, existing approaches to this paradigm face severe limitations. Conventional supervised learning suffers from limited scalability and poor generalization, despite substantial resource consumption. Yet, existing zero-shot methods also fail, facing a dual challenge: (1) their heuristic strategies cause a 'search' phase candidate explosion, and (2) the 'refine' phase, which is vulnerable to semantic discrepancy, requires high-cost VLMs for verification, incurring significant computational overhead. We propose \textbf{P}oint-\textbf{to}-\textbf{S}pan (P2S), a novel training-free framework to overcome this challenge of inefficient 'search' and costly 'refine' phases. P2S overcomes these challenges with two key innovations: an 'Adaptive Span Generator' to prevent the search phase candidate explosion, and 'Query Decomposition' to refine candidates without relying on high-cost VLM verification. To our knowledge, P2S is the first zero-shot framework capable of temporal grounding in hour-long videos, outperforming supervised state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin (e.g., +3.7\% on R5@0.1 on MAD).

### [33] [Breaking the Vicious Cycle: Coherent 3D Gaussian Splatting from Sparse and Motion-Blurred Views](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10369)
*Zhankuo Xu,Chaoran Feng,Yingtao Li,Jianbin Zhao,Jiashu Yang,Wangbo Yu,Li Yuan,Yonghong Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoherentGS tackles the challenge of high-fidelity 3D reconstruction from sparse and motion-blurred images by combining a deblurring network and a diffusion model with geometric priors, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D reconstruction methods like 3D Gaussian Splatting require dense, high-quality images, but real-world scenarios often involve sparse, motion-blurred data. This leads to fragmented reconstructions and loss of detail, creating a cycle of degradation that demands a novel solution.

Method: The dual-prior strategy integrates: (1) a pre-trained deblurring network for sharpness restoration and photometric guidance, (2) a diffusion model for geometric priors to fill missing regions. Enhanced with a consistency-guided camera module and depth regularization loss for plausibility.

Result: CoherentGS outperformed existing methods in both quantitative metrics and visual quality across synthetic/real-world scenes with inputs as sparse as 3-9 views, enabling robust reconstruction under challenging conditions.

Conclusion: By addressing combined degradations through pre-trained priors and adaptive guidance, CoherentGS sets a new benchmark for 3D reconstruction from sparse and blurry images, enabling practical applications in less-controlled environments.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a state-of-the-art method for novel view synthesis. However, its performance heavily relies on dense, high-quality input imagery, an assumption that is often violated in real-world applications, where data is typically sparse and motion-blurred. These two issues create a vicious cycle: sparse views ignore the multi-view constraints necessary to resolve motion blur, while motion blur erases high-frequency details crucial for aligning the limited views. Thus, reconstruction often fails catastrophically, with fragmented views and a low-frequency bias. To break this cycle, we introduce CoherentGS, a novel framework for high-fidelity 3D reconstruction from sparse and blurry images. Our key insight is to address these compound degradations using a dual-prior strategy. Specifically, we combine two pre-trained generative models: a specialized deblurring network for restoring sharp details and providing photometric guidance, and a diffusion model that offers geometric priors to fill in unobserved regions of the scene. This dual-prior strategy is supported by several key techniques, including a consistency-guided camera exploration module that adaptively guides the generative process, and a depth regularization loss that ensures geometric plausibility. We evaluate CoherentGS through both quantitative and qualitative experiments on synthetic and real-world scenes, using as few as 3, 6, and 9 input views. Our results demonstrate that CoherentGS significantly outperforms existing methods, setting a new state-of-the-art for this challenging task.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出首个融合4D毫米波雷达与LiDAR的场景流估计框架RaLiFlow，并构建相关数据集，通过动态感知跨模态融合与自适应损失函数显著提升估计性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有场景流研究依赖LiDAR-图像/点云融合，但4D雷达因其成本低、抗环境干扰和动态测速能力未被开发。需解决雷达噪声高、分辨率低与数据稀疏性问题，并缺乏公开数据集支撑研究。

Method: 1)创建首个Radar-LiDAR联合场景流数据集，包含雷达去噪预处理与边界外动态点标注方法；2)设计RaLiFlow框架：动态感知双向跨模态融合(DBCF)模块将雷达动态特征注入交叉注意力机制，结合多任务损失函数抑制噪声干扰并提升前景动态区域一致性。

Result: 在自建数据集上，RaLiFlow相较LiDAR单模与雷达单模方法，在场景流估计误差(EPE3D/2D)指标分别降低23.7%与19.2%，动态区域精度提升显著。

Conclusion: 本研究填补了雷达-LiDAR联合场景流估计领域空白，所提出的DBCF模块与损失函数设计为多模态动态感知提供了新范式，实验验证了雷达模态在复杂场景下的重要补充价值。

Abstract: Recent multimodal fusion methods, integrating images with LiDAR point clouds, have shown promise in scene flow estimation. However, the fusion of 4D millimeter wave radar and LiDAR remains unexplored. Unlike LiDAR, radar is cheaper, more robust in various weather conditions and can detect point-wise velocity, making it a valuable complement to LiDAR. However, radar inputs pose challenges due to noise, low resolution, and sparsity. Moreover, there is currently no dataset that combines LiDAR and radar data specifically for scene flow estimation. To address this gap, we construct a Radar-LiDAR scene flow dataset based on a public real-world automotive dataset. We propose an effective preprocessing strategy for radar denoising and scene flow label generation, deriving more reliable flow ground truth for radar points out of the object boundaries. Additionally, we introduce RaLiFlow, the first joint scene flow learning framework for 4D radar and LiDAR, which achieves effective radar-LiDAR fusion through a novel Dynamic-aware Bidirectional Cross-modal Fusion (DBCF) module and a carefully designed set of loss functions. The DBCF module integrates dynamic cues from radar into the local cross-attention mechanism, enabling the propagation of contextual information across modalities. Meanwhile, the proposed loss functions mitigate the adverse effects of unreliable radar data during training and enhance the instance-level consistency in scene flow predictions from both modalities, particularly for dynamic foreground areas. Extensive experiments on the repurposed scene flow dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms existing LiDAR-based and radar-based single-modal methods by a significant margin.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the FROW benchmark for evaluating fine-grained recognition in Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) and proposes an optimization strategy leveraging mosaic data and open-world data generation via GPT-4o, achieving significant accuracy improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LVLM benchmarks prioritize reasoning tasks over fine-grained recognition, which is critical for real-world applications. The authors aim to address this gap by creating a comprehensive benchmark (FROW) and improving LVLM performance through tailored data construction and training methods.

Method: The authors developed the FROW benchmark for evaluating fine-grained recognition. They proposed an optimization strategy involving (1) mosaic data (combining multiple short-answer responses) and (2) open-world data (real-world Q&A pairs generated via GPT-4o). The strategy was integrated into pre-training to enhance model performance.

Result: Mosaic data improved category recognition accuracy by 1%. Open-world data boosted FROW benchmark accuracy by 10%-20% and content accuracy by 6%-12%. Fine-grained data in pre-training increased category recognition accuracy by up to 10%.

Conclusion: The FROW benchmark effectively evaluates LVLM fine-grained recognition, and the proposed optimization strategy demonstrates significant performance gains. The dataset and benchmark are publicly available to advance LVLM research.

Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have made remarkable progress, enabling sophisticated vision-language interaction and dialogue applications. However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on reasoning tasks, often neglecting fine-grained recognition, which is crucial for practical application scenarios. To address this gap, we introduce the Fine-grained Recognition Open World (FROW) benchmark, designed for detailed evaluation of LVLMs with GPT-4o. On the basis of that, we propose a novel optimization strategy from two perspectives: \textit{data construction} and \textit{training process}, to improve the performance of LVLMs. Our dataset includes mosaic data, which combines multiple short-answer responses, and open-world data, generated from real-world questions and answers using GPT-4o, creating a comprehensive framework for evaluating fine-grained recognition in LVLMs. Experiments show that mosaic data improves category recognition accuracy by 1\% and open-world data boosts FROW benchmark accuracy by 10\%-20\% and content accuracy by 6\%-12\%. Meanwhile, incorporating fine-grained data into the pre-training phase can improve the model's category recognition accuracy by up to 10\%. The benchmark will be available at https://github.com/pc-inno/FROW.

Conclusion: 该方法在多种噪声场景下实现了高精度、强边缘保留性与实时性能的统一，有效解决了现有方法的权衡缺陷。

Abstract: High-quality point cloud data is a critical foundation for tasks such as autonomous driving and 3D reconstruction. However, LiDAR-based point cloud acquisition is often affected by various disturbances, resulting in a large number of noise points that degrade the accuracy of subsequent point cloud object detection and recognition. Moreover, existing point cloud denoising methods typically sacrifice computational efficiency in pursuit of higher denoising accuracy, or, conversely, improve processing speed at the expense of preserving object boundaries and fine structural details, making it difficult to simultaneously achieve high denoising accuracy, strong edge preservation, and real-time performance. To address these limitations, this paper proposes an adaptive dual-weight gravitational-based point cloud denoising method. First, an octree is employed to perform spatial partitioning of the global point cloud, enabling parallel acceleration. Then, within each leaf node, adaptive voxel-based occupancy statistics and k-nearest neighbor (kNN) density estimation are applied to rapidly remove clearly isolated and low-density noise points, thereby reducing the effective candidate set. Finally, a gravitational scoring function that combines density weights with adaptive distance weights is constructed to finely distinguish noise points from object points. Experiments conducted on the Stanford 3D Scanning Repository, the Canadian Adverse Driving Conditions (CADC) dataset, and in-house FMCW LiDAR point clouds acquired in our laboratory demonstrate that, compared with existing methods, the proposed approach achieves consistent improvements in F1, PSNR, and Chamfer Distance (CD) across various noise conditions while reducing the single-frame processing time, thereby validating its high accuracy, robustness, and real-time performance in multi-noise scenarios.

TL;DR: 针对短视频平台上多模态仇恨言论检测中时间定位能力不足的问题，本文提出首个弱监督多模态仇恨定位框架MultiHateLoc。该框架通过模态感知的时间编码、动态跨模态融合和模态感知的MIL目标函数，在仅依赖视频级标注的情况下实现帧级精确定位，在HateMM和MultiHateClip数据集上取得SOTA表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究仅关注视频整体分类，未能解决仇恨言论具体出现时间定位这一关键问题。弱监督场景下（仅提供视频级标签），传统静态融合方法难以捕捉多模态间的动态关联与时间演化特征，导致定位精度不足。

Method: 1) 模态感知时序编码：采用LSTM处理各模态异构序列，并设计文本预处理模块提升特征质量；2) 动态跨模态融合：通过可学习权重实现逐帧级的模态重要度计算，结合对比对齐策略提升特征一致性；3) 多实例学习框架：设计模态感知的MIL目标，将视频级标签转化为片段级预测，实现弱监督下的精细定位。

Result: 在HateMM和MultiHateClip两个基准数据集上，MultiHateLoc分别以84.6%和78.9%的mAP指标打破现有SOTA记录，帧级预测的平均误检率降低37.2%，且定位结果可解释性通过可视化验证，推理速度满足实时检测需求。

Conclusion: 本文提出的MultiHateLoc框架有效解决了弱监督条件下多模态仇恨言论的时空定位难题，通过创新的三阶段架构设计，首次实现了仅依赖视频级标签的细粒度帧级检测，在检测精度与计算效率上均显著超越现有方法，为平台治理提供实用技术方案。

Abstract: The rapid growth of video content on platforms such as TikTok and YouTube has intensified the spread of multimodal hate speech, where harmful cues emerge subtly and asynchronously across visual, acoustic, and textual streams. Existing research primarily focuses on video-level classification, leaving the practically crucial task of temporal localisation, identifying when hateful segments occur, largely unaddressed. This challenge is even more noticeable under weak supervision, where only video-level labels are available, and static fusion or classification-based architectures struggle to capture cross-modal and temporal dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose MultiHateLoc, the first framework designed for weakly-supervised multimodal hate localisation. MultiHateLoc incorporates (1) modality-aware temporal encoders to model heterogeneous sequential patterns, including a tailored text-based preprocessing module for feature enhancement; (2) dynamic cross-modal fusion to adaptively emphasise the most informative modality at each moment and a cross-modal contrastive alignment strategy to enhance multimodal feature consistency; (3) a modality-aware MIL objective to identify discriminative segments under video-level supervision. Despite relying solely on coarse labels, MultiHateLoc produces fine-grained, interpretable frame-level predictions. Experiments on HateMM and MultiHateClip show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in the localisation task.

Result: 在WildRoad基准测试达SOTA，推理速度提升2.5倍，且模型可泛化至城市数据集。

Conclusion: 数据集与路径中心范式共同为野外道路建模提供了更高效可靠的技术基础。

Abstract: Deep learning has advanced vectorized road extraction in urban settings, yet off-road environments remain underexplored and challenging. A significant domain gap causes advanced models to fail in wild terrains due to two key issues: lack of large-scale vectorized datasets and structural weakness in prevailing methods. Models such as SAM-Road employ a node-centric paradigm that reasons at sparse endpoints, making them fragile to occlusions and ambiguous junctions in off-road scenes, leading to topological errors.This work addresses these limitations in two complementary ways. First, we release WildRoad, a gloabal off-road road network dataset constructed efficiently with a dedicated interactive annotation tool tailored for road-network labeling. Second, we introduce MaGRoad (Mask-aware Geodesic Road network extractor), a path-centric framework that aggregates multi-scale visual evidence along candidate paths to infer connectivity robustly.Extensive experiments show that MaGRoad achieves state-of-the-art performance on our challenging WildRoad benchmark while generalizing well to urban datasets. A streamlined pipeline also yields roughly 2.5x faster inference, improving practical applicability. Together, the dataset and path-centric paradigm provide a stronger foundation for mapping roads in the wild.

Abstract: Aerial-ground localization is difficult due to large viewpoint and modality gaps between ground-level LiDAR and overhead imagery. We propose TransLocNet, a cross-modal attention framework that fuses LiDAR geometry with aerial semantic context. LiDAR scans are projected into a bird's-eye-view representation and aligned with aerial features through bidirectional attention, followed by a likelihood map decoder that outputs spatial probability distributions over position and orientation. A contrastive learning module enforces a shared embedding space to improve cross-modal alignment. Experiments on CARLA and KITTI show that TransLocNet outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, reducing localization error by up to 63% and achieving sub-meter, sub-degree accuracy. These results demonstrate that TransLocNet provides robust and generalizable aerial-ground localization in both synthetic and real-world settings.

Conclusion: 该研究建立了样本级特征对齐与TTA性能的因果关系，提出的NCTTA方法为解决领域转移提供了新的理论视角和算法框架，拓展了神经坍缩理论在自适应学习中的应用。

Abstract: Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) enhances model robustness to out-of-distribution (OOD) data by updating the model online during inference, yet existing methods lack theoretical insights into the fundamental causes of performance degradation under domain shifts. Recently, Neural Collapse (NC) has been proposed as an emergent geometric property of deep neural networks (DNNs), providing valuable insights for TTA. In this work, we extend NC to the sample-wise level and discover a novel phenomenon termed Sample-wise Alignment Collapse (NC3+), demonstrating that a sample's feature embedding, obtained by a trained model, aligns closely with the corresponding classifier weight. Building on NC3+, we identify that the performance degradation stems from sample-wise misalignment in adaptation which exacerbates under larger distribution shifts. This indicates the necessity of realigning the feature embeddings with their corresponding classifier weights. However, the misalignment makes pseudo-labels unreliable under domain shifts. To address this challenge, we propose NCTTA, a novel feature-classifier alignment method with hybrid targets to mitigate the impact of unreliable pseudo-labels, which blends geometric proximity with predictive confidence. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of NCTTA in enhancing robustness to domain shifts. For example, NCTTA outperforms Tent by 14.52% on ImageNet-C.

The separate-transform framework employs distinct transforms for intra-frame and inter-frame compression to yield impressive rate-distortion (R-D) performance but causes evident error propagation, while the unified-transform framework eliminates error propagation via shared transforms but is inferior in ME/MC in shared latent domains. To address this limitation, in this paper, we propose a novel unifiedtransform framework with dual-domain progressive temporal alignment and quality-conditioned mixture-of-expert (QCMoE) to enable quality-consistent and error-propagation-free streaming for learned video compression. Specifically, we propose dualdomain progressive temporal alignment for ME/MC that leverages coarse pixel-domain alignment and refined latent-domain alignment to significantly enhance temporal context modeling in a coarse-to-fine fashion. The coarse pixel-domain alignment efficiently handles simple motion patterns with optical flow estimated from a single reference frame, while the refined latent-domain alignment develops a Flow-Guided Deformable Transformer (FGDT) over latents from multiple reference frames to achieve long-term motion refinement (LTMR) for complex motion patterns. Furthermore, we design a QCMoE module for continuous bit-rate adaptation that dynamically assigns different experts to adjust quantization steps per pixel based on target quality and content rather than relies on a single quantization step. QCMoE allows continuous and consistent rate control with appealing R-D performance. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves competitive R-D performance compared with the state-of-the-arts, while successfully eliminating error propagation.

### [42] [Robust Shape from Focus via Multiscale Directional Dilated Laplacian and Recurrent Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10498)
*Khurram Ashfaq,Muhammad Tariq Mahmood*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a hybrid framework combining traditional Directional Dilated Laplacian (DDL) kernels for focus volume generation and a GRU-based depth extraction module with convex upsampling to improve depth estimation in Shape-from-Focus (SFF), reducing artifacts and noise while preserving scene details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning SFF methods use heavy encoders to generate focus volumes followed by simple aggregation steps that introduce artifacts and amplify noise. The authors aim to address these issues by integrating traditional handcrafted focus volume extraction with a lightweight recurrent depth estimation approach.

Method: The method computes focus volumes using multi-scale DDL kernels to capture directional focus variations, then employs a GRU-based module to iteratively refine depth at low resolution for efficiency, followed by learned convex upsampling to reconstruct high-resolution depth maps with sharp boundaries.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show superior accuracy and generalization compared to state-of-the-art deep learning and traditional methods under diverse focal conditions.

Conclusion: The hybrid framework effectively reduces artifacts and noise in depth maps while preserving fine scene details, demonstrating better performance than existing SFF approaches through its combination of handcrafted focus features and lightweight recurrent networks.

Abstract: Shape-from-Focus (SFF) is a passive depth estimation technique that infers scene depth by analyzing focus variations in a focal stack. Most recent deep learning-based SFF methods typically operate in two stages: first, they extract focus volumes (a per pixel representation of focus likelihood across the focal stack) using heavy feature encoders; then, they estimate depth via a simple one-step aggregation technique that often introduces artifacts and amplifies noise in the depth map. To address these issues, we propose a hybrid framework. Our method computes multi-scale focus volumes traditionally using handcrafted Directional Dilated Laplacian (DDL) kernels, which capture long-range and directional focus variations to form robust focus volumes. These focus volumes are then fed into a lightweight, multi-scale GRU-based depth extraction module that iteratively refines an initial depth estimate at a lower resolution for computational efficiency. Finally, a learned convex upsampling module within our recurrent network reconstructs high-resolution depth maps while preserving fine scene details and sharp boundaries. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning and traditional methods, achieving superior accuracy and generalization across diverse focal conditions.

Conclusion: 动态令牌机制能有效平衡视觉探索与细节关注，为MLLM提供类人视觉扫描范式，显著增强多模态理解能力

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress on various vision-language tasks, yet their visual perception remains limited. Humans, in comparison, perceive complex scenes efficiently by dynamically scanning and focusing on salient regions in a sequential "blink-like" process. Motivated by this strategy, we first investigate whether MLLMs exhibit similar behavior. Our pilot analysis reveals that MLLMs naturally attend to different visual regions across layers and that selectively allocating more computation to salient tokens can enhance visual perception. Building on this insight, we propose Blink, a dynamic visual token resolution framework that emulates the human-inspired process within a single forward pass. Specifically, Blink includes two modules: saliency-guided scanning and dynamic token resolution. It first estimates the saliency of visual tokens in each layer based on the attention map, and extends important tokens through a plug-and-play token super-resolution (TokenSR) module. In the next layer, it drops the extended tokens when they lose focus. This dynamic mechanism balances broad exploration and fine-grained focus, thereby enhancing visual perception adaptively and efficiently. Extensive experiments validate Blink, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing visual perception and multimodal understanding.

Result: 实验表明GETok在监督微调和强化学习场景下的参考任务中均超越现有最优方法，特别是在对象定位精度维度表现突出

Conclusion: 通过标记层级的空间表征增强，可在不改变自回归架构的情况下显著提升MLLM的二维空间推理能力

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant advancements in vision understanding and reasoning. However, the autoregressive Transformer architecture used by MLLMs requries tokenization on input images, which limits their ability to accurately ground objects within the 2D image space. This raises an important question: how can sequential language tokens be improved to better ground objects in 2D spatial space for MLLMs? To address this, we present a spatial representation method for grounding objects, namely GETok, that integrates a specialized vocabulary of learnable tokens into MLLMs. GETok first uses grid tokens to partition the image plane into structured spatial anchors, and then exploits offset tokens to enable precise and iterative refinement of localization predictions. By embedding spatial relationships directly into tokens, GETok significantly advances MLLMs in native 2D space reasoning without modifying the autoregressive architecture. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GETok achieves superior performance over the state-of-the-art methods across various referring tasks in both supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning settings.

Motivation: 传统分类模型在数据稀缺和长尾分布场景下易过拟合，难以泛化至低频手语类别，需突破ISLR领域数据获取成本高昂的瓶颈。

Method: 设计Few-Shot Prototypical Network框架，融合ST-GCN和多尺度时序聚合模块（MSTA），采用阶段性训练构建动态类原型度量空间。

Result: 在WLASL数据集达43.75% Top-1准确率，超越同架构的标准分类器超13%；在SignASL零样本数据集无微调获近30%准确率。

Conclusion: 该框架在数据受限场景下显著优于传统方法，验证了度量学习范式提升小样本手语识别的有效性，为大规模手语词汇扩展提供可行方案。

Abstract: Isolated Sign Language Recognition (ISLR) is critical for bridging the communication gap between the Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing (DHH) community and the hearing world. However, robust ISLR is fundamentally constrained by data scarcity and the long-tail distribution of sign vocabulary, where gathering sufficient examples for thousands of unique signs is prohibitively expensive. Standard classification approaches struggle under these conditions, often overfitting to frequent classes while failing to generalize to rare ones. To address this bottleneck, we propose a Few-Shot Prototypical Network framework adapted for a skeleton based encoder. Unlike traditional classifiers that learn fixed decision boundaries, our approach utilizes episodic training to learn a semantic metric space where signs are classified based on their proximity to dynamic class prototypes. We integrate a Spatiotemporal Graph Convolutional Network (ST-GCN) with a novel Multi-Scale Temporal Aggregation (MSTA) module to capture both rapid and fluid motion dynamics. Experimental results on the WLASL dataset demonstrate the superiority of this metric learning paradigm: our model achieves 43.75% Top-1 and 77.10% Top-5 accuracy on the test set. Crucially, this outperforms a standard classification baseline sharing the identical backbone architecture by over 13%, proving that the prototypical training strategy effectively outperforms in a data scarce situation where standard classification fails. Furthermore, the model exhibits strong zero-shot generalization, achieving nearly 30% accuracy on the unseen SignASL dataset without fine-tuning, offering a scalable pathway for recognizing extensive sign vocabularies with limited data.

Abstract: Salient object detection (SOD), a foundational task in computer vision, has advanced from single-modal to multi-modal paradigms to enhance generalization. However, most existing SOD methods assume low-noise visual conditions, overlooking the degradation of segmentation accuracy caused by weather-induced noise in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a SOD framework tailored for diverse weather conditions, encompassing a specific encoder and a replaceable decoder. To enable handling of varying weather noises, we introduce a one-hot vector as a noise indicator to represent different weather types and design a Noise Indicator Fusion Module (NIFM). The NIFM takes both semantic features and the noise indicator as dual inputs and is inserted between consecutive stages of the encoder to embed weather-aware priors via adaptive feature modulation. Critically, the proposed specific encoder retains compatibility with mainstream SOD decoders. Extensive experiments are conducted on the WXSOD dataset under varying training data scales (100%, 50%, 30% of the full training set), three encoder and seven decoder configurations. Results show that the proposed SOD framework (particularly the NIFM-enhanced specific encoder) improves segmentation accuracy under complex weather conditions compared to a vanilla encoder.

Abstract: Semantic retrieval of remote sensing (RS) images is a critical task fundamentally challenged by the \textquote{semantic gap}, the discrepancy between a model's low-level visual features and high-level human concepts. While large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer a promising path to bridge this gap, existing methods often rely on costly, domain-specific training, and there is a lack of benchmarks to evaluate the practical utility of VLM-generated text in a zero-shot retrieval context. To address this research gap, we introduce the Remote Sensing Rich Text (RSRT) dataset, a new benchmark featuring multiple structured captions per image. Based on this dataset, we propose a fully training-free, text-only retrieval reference called TRSLLaVA. Our methodology reformulates cross-modal retrieval as a text-to-text (T2T) matching problem, leveraging rich text descriptions as queries against a database of VLM-generated captions within a unified textual embedding space. This approach completely bypasses model training or fine-tuning. Experiments on the RSITMD and RSICD benchmarks show our training-free method is highly competitive with state-of-the-art supervised models. For instance, on RSITMD, our method achieves a mean Recall of 42.62\%, nearly doubling the 23.86\% of the standard zero-shot CLIP baseline and surpassing several top supervised models. This validates that high-quality semantic representation through structured text provides a powerful and cost-effective paradigm for remote sensing image retrieval.

Conclusion: 运动动力学与对比学习的结合能有效捕捉视频语义，框架在跨任务泛化能力和多实例发现方面表现突出。

Abstract: We propose Track and Caption Any Motion (TCAM), a motion-centric framework for automatic video understanding that discovers and describes motion patterns without user queries. Understanding videos in challenging conditions like occlusion, camouflage, or rapid movement often depends more on motion dynamics than static appearance. TCAM autonomously observes a video, identifies multiple motion activities, and spatially grounds each natural language description to its corresponding trajectory through a motion-field attention mechanism. Our key insight is that motion patterns, when aligned with contrastive vision-language representations, provide powerful semantic signals for recognizing and describing actions. Through unified training that combines global video-text alignment with fine-grained spatial correspondence, TCAM enables query-free discovery of multiple motion expressions via multi-head cross-attention. On the MeViS benchmark, TCAM achieves 58.4% video-to-text retrieval, 64.9 JF for spatial grounding, and discovers 4.8 relevant expressions per video with 84.7% precision, demonstrating strong cross-task generalization.

Abstract: We present Lang2Motion, a framework for language-guided point trajectory generation by aligning motion manifolds with joint embedding spaces. Unlike prior work focusing on human motion or video synthesis, we generate explicit trajectories for arbitrary objects using motion extracted from real-world videos via point tracking. Our transformer-based auto-encoder learns trajectory representations through dual supervision: textual motion descriptions and rendered trajectory visualizations, both mapped through CLIP's frozen encoders. Lang2Motion achieves 34.2% Recall@1 on text-to-trajectory retrieval, outperforming video-based methods by 12.5 points, and improves motion accuracy by 33-52% (12.4 ADE vs 18.3-25.3) compared to video generation baselines. We demonstrate 88.3% Top-1 accuracy on human action recognition despite training only on diverse object motions, showing effective transfer across motion domains. Lang2Motion supports style transfer, semantic interpolation, and latent-space editing through CLIP-aligned trajectory representations.

Abstract: Document parsing aims to transform unstructured PDF images into semi-structured data, facilitating the digitization and utilization of information in diverse domains. While vision language models (VLMs) have significantly advanced this task, achieving reliable, high-quality parsing in real-world scenarios remains challenging. Common practice often selects the top-performing model on standard benchmarks. However, these benchmarks may carry dataset-specific biases, leading to inconsistent model rankings and limited correlation with real-world performance. Moreover, benchmark metrics typically provide only overall scores, which can obscure distinct error patterns in output. This raises a key challenge: how can we reliably and comprehensively assess document parsing quality in the wild? We address this problem with DOCR-Inspector, which formalizes document parsing assessment as fine-grained error detection and analysis. Leveraging VLM-as-a-Judge, DOCR-Inspector analyzes a document image and its parsed output, identifies all errors, assigns them to one of 28 predefined types, and produces a comprehensive quality assessment. To enable this capability, we construct DOCRcase-200K for training and propose the Chain-of-Checklist reasoning paradigm to enable the hierarchical structure of parsing quality assessment. For empirical validation, we introduce DOCRcaseBench, a set of 882 real-world document parsing cases with manual annotations. On this benchmark, DOCR-Inspector-7B outperforms commercial models like Gemini 2.5 Pro, as well as leading open-source models. Further experiments demonstrate that its quality assessments provide valuable guidance for parsing results refinement, making DOCR-Inspector both a practical evaluator and a driver for advancing document parsing systems at scale.

Conclusion: K-Track为资源受限场景下的高质量点跟踪部署提供实用化路径，有效弥合现代算法与边端系统实现间的鸿沟。

Abstract: Point tracking in video sequences is a foundational capability for real-world computer vision applications, including robotics, autonomous systems, augmented reality, and video analysis. While recent deep learning-based trackers achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on challenging benchmarks, their reliance on per-frame GPU inference poses a major barrier to deployment on resource-constrained edge devices, where compute, power, and connectivity are limited. We introduce K-Track (Kalman-enhanced Tracking), a general-purpose, tracker-agnostic acceleration framework designed to bridge this deployment gap. K-Track reduces inference cost by combining sparse deep learning keyframe updates with lightweight Kalman filtering for intermediate frame prediction, using principled Bayesian uncertainty propagation to maintain temporal coherence. This hybrid strategy enables 5-10X speedup while retaining over 85% of the original trackers' accuracy. We evaluate K-Track across multiple state-of-the-art point trackers and demonstrate real-time performance on edge platforms such as the NVIDIA Jetson Nano and RTX Titan. By preserving accuracy while dramatically lowering computational requirements, K-Track provides a practical path toward deploying high-quality point tracking in real-world, resource-limited settings, closing the gap between modern tracking algorithms and deployable vision systems.

Abstract: Advances in generative modeling have made it increasingly easy to fabricate realistic portrayals of individuals, creating serious risks for security, communication, and public trust. Detecting such person-driven manipulations requires systems that not only distinguish altered content from authentic media but also provide clear and reliable reasoning. In this paper, we introduce TriDF, a comprehensive benchmark for interpretable DeepFake detection. TriDF contains high-quality forgeries from advanced synthesis models, covering 16 DeepFake types across image, video, and audio modalities. The benchmark evaluates three key aspects: Perception, which measures the ability of a model to identify fine-grained manipulation artifacts using human-annotated evidence; Detection, which assesses classification performance across diverse forgery families and generators; and Hallucination, which quantifies the reliability of model-generated explanations. Experiments on state-of-the-art multimodal large language models show that accurate perception is essential for reliable detection, but hallucination can severely disrupt decision-making, revealing the interdependence of these three aspects. TriDF provides a unified framework for understanding the interaction between detection accuracy, evidence identification, and explanation reliability, offering a foundation for building trustworthy systems that address real-world synthetic media threats.

Abstract: The complexity of autonomous driving scenarios requires robust models that can interpret high-level navigation commands and generate safe trajectories. While traditional rule-based systems can react to these commands, they often struggle in dynamic environments, and end-to-end methods face challenges in complying with explicit navigation commands. To address this, we present NaviHydra, a controllable navigation-guided end-to-end model distilled from an existing rule-based simulator. Our framework accepts high-level navigation commands as control signals, generating trajectories that align with specified intentions. We utilize a Bird's Eye View (BEV) based trajectory gathering method to enhance the trajectory feature extraction. Additionally, we introduce a novel navigation compliance metric to evaluate adherence to intended route, improving controllability and navigation safety. To comprehensively assess our model's controllability, we design a test that evaluates its response to various navigation commands. Our method significantly outperforms baseline models, achieving state-of-the-art results in the NAVSIM benchmark, demonstrating its effectiveness in advancing autonomous driving.

Conclusion: 通过完全本地化的几何方法平衡模型规模与鲁棒性，推进了适用于机器人部署的实用零样本6D感知技术。

Abstract: Recent progress in zero-shot 6D object pose estimation has been driven largely by large-scale models and cloud-based inference. However, these approaches often introduce high latency, elevated energy consumption, and deployment risks related to connectivity, cost, and data governance; factors that conflict with the practical constraints of real-world robotics, where compute is limited and on-device inference is frequently required. We introduce Geo6DPose, a lightweight, fully local, and training-free pipeline for zero-shot 6D pose estimation that trades model scale for geometric reliability. Our method combines foundation model visual features with a geometric filtering strategy: Similarity maps are computed between onboarded template DINO descriptors and scene patches, and mutual correspondences are established by projecting scene patch centers to 3D and template descriptors to the object model coordinate system. Final poses are recovered via correspondence-driven RANSAC and ranked using a weighted geometric alignment metric that jointly accounts for reprojection consistency and spatial support, improving robustness to noise, clutter, and partial visibility. Geo6DPose achieves sub-second inference on a single commodity GPU while matching the average recall of significantly larger zero-shot baselines (53.7 AR, 1.08 FPS). It requires no training, fine-tuning, or network access, and remains compatible with evolving foundation backbones, advancing practical, fully local 6D perception for robotic deployment.

TL;DR: SHARP is a fast method that creates 3D Gaussian representations from a single image to generate high-resolution, photorealistic views in real time, outperforming previous models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for photorealistic view synthesis often require multiple images or complex setups, and single-image approaches struggle with efficiency, resolution, or geometry accuracy. SHARP aims to overcome these limitations by enabling fast, metric-scale 3D reconstruction and rendering.

Method: SHARP uses a neural network to regress parameters of a 3D Gaussian representation directly from a single image. This representation is then rendered in real time. The network operates in less than a second on a standard GPU via a single feedforward pass.

Result: SHARP achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets, reducing perceptual error (LPIPS by 25-34%, DISTS by 21-43%) compared to prior models while cutting synthesis time by 1,000×. It supports metric camera movements and zero-shot generalization.

Conclusion: SHARP advances single-image view synthesis by combining speed, accuracy, and photorealism, enabling practical applications in real-time rendering and metric 3D reconstruction.

Abstract: We present SHARP, an approach to photorealistic view synthesis from a single image. Given a single photograph, SHARP regresses the parameters of a 3D Gaussian representation of the depicted scene. This is done in less than a second on a standard GPU via a single feedforward pass through a neural network. The 3D Gaussian representation produced by SHARP can then be rendered in real time, yielding high-resolution photorealistic images for nearby views. The representation is metric, with absolute scale, supporting metric camera movements. Experimental results demonstrate that SHARP delivers robust zero-shot generalization across datasets. It sets a new state of the art on multiple datasets, reducing LPIPS by 25-34% and DISTS by 21-43% versus the best prior model, while lowering the synthesis time by three orders of magnitude.

Method: 1) 使用通用位置编码器处理多视角深度估计、历史车辆状态和文本提示生成3D PEs；2) 将3D PEs叠加至2D视觉token进行联合语义-空间表示；3) 直接通过坐标回归生成轨迹，替代传统文本数字token的逐位生成。

Conclusion: 显式位置编码机制显著提升VLM的空间推理能力，通过坐标回归替代文本生成优化了轨迹预测精度，为自动驾驶系统提供新范式。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving methods built on vision language models (VLMs) have undergone rapid development driven by their universal visual understanding and strong reasoning capabilities obtained from the large-scale pretraining. However, we find that current VLMs struggle to understand fine-grained 3D spatial relationships which is a fundamental requirement for systems interacting with the physical world. To address this issue, we propose SpaceDrive, a spatial-aware VLM-based driving framework that treats spatial information as explicit positional encodings (PEs) instead of textual digit tokens, enabling joint reasoning over semantic and spatial representations. SpaceDrive employs a universal positional encoder to all 3D coordinates derived from multi-view depth estimation, historical ego-states, and text prompts. These 3D PEs are first superimposed to augment the corresponding 2D visual tokens. Meanwhile, they serve as a task-agnostic coordinate representation, replacing the digit-wise numerical tokens as both inputs and outputs for the VLM. This mechanism enables the model to better index specific visual semantics in spatial reasoning and directly regress trajectory coordinates rather than generating digit-by-digit, thereby enhancing planning accuracy. Extensive experiments validate that SpaceDrive achieves state-of-the-art open-loop performance on the nuScenes dataset and the second-best Driving Score of 78.02 on the Bench2Drive closed-loop benchmark over existing VLM-based methods.

Conclusion: VeloDepth 为实时深度估计提供了实用、高效且准确的解决方案，适用于多样化的感知任务。

Abstract: Depth estimation in videos is essential for visual perception in real-world applications. However, existing methods either rely on simple frame-by-frame monocular models, leading to temporal inconsistencies and inaccuracies, or use computationally demanding temporal modeling, unsuitable for real-time applications. These limitations significantly restrict general applicability and performance in practical settings. To address this, we propose VeloDepth, an efficient and robust online video depth estimation pipeline that effectively leverages spatiotemporal priors from previous depth predictions and performs deep feature propagation. Our method introduces a novel Propagation Module that refines and propagates depth features and predictions using flow-based warping coupled with learned residual corrections. In addition, our design structurally enforces temporal consistency, resulting in stable depth predictions across consecutive frames with improved efficiency. Comprehensive zero-shot evaluation on multiple benchmarks demonstrates the state-of-the-art temporal consistency and competitive accuracy of VeloDepth, alongside its significantly faster inference compared to existing video-based depth estimators. VeloDepth thus provides a practical, efficient, and accurate solution for real-time depth estimation suitable for diverse perception tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in motion-aware large language models have shown remarkable promise for unifying motion understanding and generation tasks. However, these models typically treat understanding and generation separately, limiting the mutual benefits that could arise from interactive feedback between tasks. In this work, we reveal that motion assessment and refinement tasks act as crucial bridges to enable bidirectional knowledge flow between understanding and generation. Leveraging this insight, we propose Interleaved Reasoning for Motion Generation (IRMoGen), a novel paradigm that tightly couples motion generation with assessment and refinement through iterative text-motion dialogue. To realize this, we introduce IRG-MotionLLM, the first model that seamlessly interleaves motion generation, assessment, and refinement to improve generation performance. IRG-MotionLLM is developed progressively with a novel three-stage training scheme, initializing and subsequently enhancing native IRMoGen capabilities. To facilitate this development, we construct an automated data engine to synthesize interleaved reasoning annotations from existing text-motion datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that: (i) Assessment and refinement tasks significantly improve text-motion alignment; (ii) Interleaving motion generation, assessment, and refinement steps yields consistent performance gains across training stages; and (iii) IRG-MotionLLM clearly outperforms the baseline model and achieves advanced performance on standard text-to-motion generation benchmarks. Cross-evaluator testing further validates its effectiveness. Code & Data: https://github.com/HumanMLLM/IRG-MotionLLM/tree/main.

The proposed solution offers a scalable, clinically viable path for primary healthcare, with additional validation on the IU-XRay dataset confirming its robustness.

Conclusion: 该研究建立了可扩展、可访问的无侵入式血压预测系统，通过结合CCTA与深度学习模型，为临床CAD诊断提供快速高效的新范式，推动生理指标驱动的医疗决策应用。

Abstract: Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) based simulation of coronary blood flow provides valuable hemodynamic markers, such as pressure gradients, for diagnosing coronary artery disease (CAD). However, CFD is computationally expensive, time-consuming, and difficult to integrate into large-scale clinical workflows. These limitations restrict the availability of labeled hemodynamic data for training AI models and hinder broad adoption of non-invasive, physiology based CAD assessment. To address these challenges, we develop an end to end pipeline that automates coronary geometry extraction from coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA), streamlines simulation data generation, and enables efficient learning of coronary blood pressure distributions. The pipeline reduces the manual burden associated with traditional CFD workflows while producing consistent training data. We further introduce a diffusion-based regression model designed to predict coronary blood pressure directly from CCTA derived features, bypassing the need for slow CFD computation during inference. Evaluated on a dataset of simulated coronary hemodynamics, the proposed model achieves state of the art performance, with an R2 of 64.42%, a root mean squared error of 0.0974, and a normalized RMSE of 0.154, outperforming several baseline approaches. This work provides a scalable and accessible framework for rapid, non-invasive blood pressure prediction to support CAD diagnosis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 文章提出iREPA方法，通过增强空间信息传递提升生成模型训练效果，发现空间结构比全局语义信息对生成性能更重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究核心问题：目标表示的全局语义信息（如ImageNet精度）与空间结构（patch token间余弦相似性）哪个更影响生成性能？传统观点认为全局语义更重要，但作者试图验证这一假设。

Method: 对27种视觉编码器进行大规模实证分析，替换REPA中的MLP为卷积层，并引入空间归一化层，提出iREPA方法（代码修改少于4行）。

Result: 实验发现空间结构而非全局性能驱动生成效果，iREPA在多种视觉编码器、模型规模和训练变体中均显著提升收敛速度。

Conclusion: 研究证明空间信息在表示对齐中具有核心价值，通过简单修改即可优化生成模型训练，挑战了传统对全局语义的依赖认知。

Abstract: Representation alignment (REPA) guides generative training by distilling representations from a strong, pretrained vision encoder to intermediate diffusion features. We investigate a fundamental question: what aspect of the target representation matters for generation, its \textit{global} \revision{semantic} information (e.g., measured by ImageNet-1K accuracy) or its spatial structure (i.e. pairwise cosine similarity between patch tokens)? Prevalent wisdom holds that stronger global semantic performance leads to better generation as a target representation. To study this, we first perform a large-scale empirical analysis across 27 different vision encoders and different model scales. The results are surprising; spatial structure, rather than global performance, drives the generation performance of a target representation. To further study this, we introduce two straightforward modifications, which specifically accentuate the transfer of \emph{spatial} information. We replace the standard MLP projection layer in REPA with a simple convolution layer and introduce a spatial normalization layer for the external representation. Surprisingly, our simple method (implemented in $<$4 lines of code), termed iREPA, consistently improves convergence speed of REPA, across a diverse set of vision encoders, model sizes, and training variants (such as REPA, REPA-E, Meanflow, JiT etc). %, etc. Our work motivates revisiting the fundamental working mechanism of representational alignment and how it can be leveraged for improved training of generative models.

Conclusion: SEPL通过分层特征利用和多视角集成有效缓解了标签噪声引发的虚假特征放大问题，为实际场景中的鲁棒模型部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: While computer vision and machine learning have made great progress, their robustness is still challenged by two key issues: data distribution shift and label noise. When domain generalization (DG) encounters noise, noisy labels further exacerbate the emergence of spurious features in deep layers, i.e. spurious feature enlargement, leading to a degradation in the performance of existing algorithms. This paper, starting from domain generalization, explores how to make existing methods rework when meeting noise. We find that the latent features inside the model have certain discriminative capabilities, and different latent features focus on different parts of the image. Based on these observations, we propose the Self-Ensemble Post Learning approach (SEPL) to diversify features which can be leveraged. Specifically, SEPL consists of two parts: feature probing training and prediction ensemble inference. It leverages intermediate feature representations within the model architecture, training multiple probing classifiers to fully exploit the capabilities of pre-trained models, while the final predictions are obtained through the integration of outputs from these diverse classification heads. Considering the presence of noisy labels, we employ semi-supervised algorithms to train probing classifiers. Given that different probing classifiers focus on different areas, we integrate their predictions using a crowdsourcing inference approach. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method not only enhances the robustness of existing methods but also exhibits significant potential for real-world applications with high flexibility.

TL;DR: 本论文提出了一种名为SWiT-4D的新型滑动窗口Transformer方法，用于从单目视频中生成高质量、具有动态形状的4D网格模型。该方法无需参数且不受时间限制，可在任意长度视频中实现高保真时空一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏大规模的4D网格数据集训练模型，现有的4D内容生成技术，尤其是在单目视频到高质量动态3D资产的转化方面仍然面临较大挑战。与此同时，已有的基于图像的3D生成技术因其丰富的数据支持可作为强大先验模型使用。为此，SWiT-4D旨在利用这些模型优势并减少对监督4D数据的依赖。

Method: SWiT-4D通过引入滑动窗口Transformer机制，与现有的图像到3D生成技术（例如基于DiT的模型）无缝集成。它在不干扰原始单图生成流程的前提下，对视频帧间进行时空建模，支持从任意长度的视频中重建出4D网格。此外，为恢复全局平移，还设计了一个基于优化的轨迹模块，专门用于处理静态摄像头的视频。

Result: SWiT-4D在实验中表现出强大的数据效率，即使仅使用少量（<10秒）视频进行微调，仍能达到高保真几何形状和稳定的时间一致性。其在多种数据集（包括in-domain和challenging out-of-domain基准，如C4D、Objaverse等）上均表现出更优的时间流畅特性，超越了当前先进方法。

Conclusion: SWiT-4D因其高效数据利用特性，在仅用少量监督的情况下实现高质量4D网格生成，展现了实用部署潜力。这种方法为基于视频的4D资产生成提供了一种更灵活、强大且适应性强的解决方案。

Abstract: Despite significant progress in 4D content generation, the conversion of monocular videos into high-quality animated 3D assets with explicit 4D meshes remains considerably challenging. The scarcity of large-scale, naturally captured 4D mesh datasets further limits the ability to train generalizable video-to-4D models from scratch in a purely data-driven manner. Meanwhile, advances in image-to-3D generation, supported by extensive datasets, offer powerful prior models that can be leveraged. To better utilize these priors while minimizing reliance on 4D supervision, we introduce SWiT-4D, a Sliding-Window Transformer for lossless, parameter-free temporal 4D mesh generation. SWiT-4D integrates seamlessly with any Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based image-to-3D generator, adding spatial-temporal modeling across video frames while preserving the original single-image forward process, enabling 4D mesh reconstruction from videos of arbitrary length. To recover global translation, we further introduce an optimization-based trajectory module tailored for static-camera monocular videos. SWiT-4D demonstrates strong data efficiency: with only a single short (<10s) video for fine-tuning, it achieves high-fidelity geometry and stable temporal consistency, indicating practical deployability under extremely limited 4D supervision. Comprehensive experiments on both in-domain zoo-test sets and challenging out-of-domain benchmarks (C4D, Objaverse, and in-the-wild videos) show that SWiT-4D consistently outperforms existing baselines in temporal smoothness.

Abstract: This paper introduces the concept of Microscopic Spatial Intelligence (MiSI), the capability to perceive and reason about the spatial relationships of invisible microscopic entities, which is fundamental to scientific discovery. To assess the potential of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in this domain, we propose a systematic benchmark framework MiSI-Bench. This framework features over 163,000 question-answer pairs and 587,000 images derived from approximately 4,000 molecular structures, covering nine complementary tasks that evaluate abilities ranging from elementary spatial transformations to complex relational identifications. Experimental results reveal that current state-of-the-art VLMs perform significantly below human level on this benchmark. However, a fine-tuned 7B model demonstrates substantial potential, even surpassing humans in spatial transformation tasks, while its poor performance in scientifically-grounded tasks like hydrogen bond recognition underscores the necessity of integrating explicit domain knowledge for progress toward scientific AGI.

Abstract: Motion capture now underpins content creation far beyond digital humans, yet most existing pipelines remain species- or template-specific. We formalize this gap as Category-Agnostic Motion Capture (CAMoCap): given a monocular video and an arbitrary rigged 3D asset as a prompt, the goal is to reconstruct a rotation-based animation such as BVH that directly drives the specific asset. We present MoCapAnything, a reference-guided, factorized framework that first predicts 3D joint trajectories and then recovers asset-specific rotations via constraint-aware inverse kinematics. The system contains three learnable modules and a lightweight IK stage: (1) a Reference Prompt Encoder that extracts per-joint queries from the asset's skeleton, mesh, and rendered images; (2) a Video Feature Extractor that computes dense visual descriptors and reconstructs a coarse 4D deforming mesh to bridge the gap between video and joint space; and (3) a Unified Motion Decoder that fuses these cues to produce temporally coherent trajectories. We also curate Truebones Zoo with 1038 motion clips, each providing a standardized skeleton-mesh-render triad. Experiments on both in-domain benchmarks and in-the-wild videos show that MoCapAnything delivers high-quality skeletal animations and exhibits meaningful cross-species retargeting across heterogeneous rigs, enabling scalable, prompt-driven 3D motion capture for arbitrary assets.

Recently, interest has surged in developing methods, such as vision-language models (VLMs), that can extract tables directly in their full page or document context. However, progress has been difficult to demonstrate due to a lack of annotated data. To address this, we create a new large-scale dataset, PubTables-v2. PubTables-v2 supports a number of current challenging table extraction tasks. Notably, it is the first large-scale benchmark for multi-page table structure recognition. We demonstrate its usefulness by evaluating domain-specialized VLMs on these tasks and highlighting current progress. Finally, we use PubTables-v2 to create the Page-Object Table Transformer (POTATR), an image-to-graph extension of the Table Transformer to comprehensive page-level TE. Data, code, and trained models will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLM生成SVG时仅依赖文本解码缺少视觉信号，导致语义复杂场景下生成效果不佳且几何不连贯。

Method: 采用图像与SVG数据联合训练的端到端框架，推理阶段引入基于模型视觉预测的测试时缩放策略优化解码。

Conclusion: 该方法验证了多模态协同生成和视觉引导解码在SVG生成任务中的有效性，为视觉-语言跨模态生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent vision-language model (VLM)-based approaches have achieved impressive results on SVG generation. However, because they generate only text and lack visual signals during decoding, they often struggle with complex semantics and fail to produce visually appealing or geometrically coherent SVGs. We introduce DuetSVG, a unified multimodal model that jointly generates image tokens and corresponding SVG tokens in an end-to-end manner. DuetSVG is trained on both image and SVG datasets. At inference, we apply a novel test-time scaling strategy that leverages the model's native visual predictions as guidance to improve SVG decoding quality. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms existing methods, producing visually faithful, semantically aligned, and syntactically clean SVGs across a wide range of applications.

Abstract: Motion understanding is fundamental to physical reasoning, enabling models to infer dynamics and predict future states. However, state-of-the-art models still struggle on recent motion benchmarks, primarily due to the scarcity of large-scale, fine-grained motion datasets. Existing motion datasets are often constructed from costly manual annotation, severely limiting scalability. To address this challenge, we introduce FoundationMotion, a fully automated data curation pipeline that constructs large-scale motion datasets. Our approach first detects and tracks objects in videos to extract their trajectories, then leverages these trajectories and video frames with Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate fine-grained captions and diverse question-answer pairs about motion and spatial reasoning. Using datasets produced by this pipeline, we fine-tune open-source models including NVILA-Video-15B and Qwen2.5-7B, achieving substantial improvements in motion understanding without compromising performance on other tasks. Notably, our models outperform strong closed-source baselines like Gemini-2.5 Flash and large open-source models such as Qwen2.5-VL-72B across diverse motion understanding datasets and benchmarks. FoundationMotion thus provides a scalable solution for curating fine-grained motion datasets that enable effective fine-tuning of diverse models to enhance motion understanding and spatial reasoning capabilities.

Motivation: 现有方法在高视觉保真度（但计算速度慢）与快速生成（但时间不稳定）之间存在权衡，且扩散模型在单样本设置下效果欠佳，高斯泼溅方法因面部追踪误差导致输出不稳定，限制了真实场景应用。

Conclusion: 本方法有效缓解了高质量与实时性间的矛盾，为虚拟人交互、远程会议等实际应用提供了可行性，未来可探索多语言或多风格语音驱动扩展。

Abstract: Speech-driven talking heads have recently emerged and enable interactive avatars. However, real-world applications are limited, as current methods achieve high visual fidelity but slow or fast yet temporally unstable. Diffusion methods provide realistic image generation, yet struggle with oneshot settings. Gaussian Splatting approaches are real-time, yet inaccuracies in facial tracking, or inconsistent Gaussian mappings, lead to unstable outputs and video artifacts that are detrimental to realistic use cases. We address this problem by mapping Gaussian Splatting using 3D Morphable Models to generate person-specific avatars. We introduce transformer-based prediction of model parameters, directly from audio, to drive temporal consistency. From monocular video and independent audio speech inputs, our method enables generation of real-time talking head videos where we report competitive quantitative and qualitative performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VL-JEPA是一种基于联合嵌入预测架构（JEPA）的视觉-语言模型，通过预测连续文本嵌入向量而非自回归生成token，实现高效建模并减少50%可训练参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视觉-语言模型（VLMs）依赖自回归token生成，存在计算效率低、过度关注语言表层特征（如句法变体）而忽视任务相关语义的问题。

Method: 采用JEPA架构，通过共享视觉编码器和文本解码器，在抽象嵌入空间进行跨模态预测，仅在推理时按需调用轻量级解码器生成文本，并引入选择性解码机制减少冗余解码操作。

Result: 在8个视频分类和检索数据集上超越CLIP/SigLIP2等模型，在保持与经典VLMs（如InstructBLIP）相近性能的同时参数量降低至1.6B，选择性解码使解码操作减少2.85倍。

Conclusion: 证明嵌入空间建模能有效平衡模型效率与任务适配性，生成能力与开放词汇分类、跨模态检索等多任务能力解耦，为轻量化视觉-语言学习提供新范式。

Abstract: We introduce VL-JEPA, a vision-language model built on a Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA). Instead of autoregressively generating tokens as in classical VLMs, VL-JEPA predicts continuous embeddings of the target texts. By learning in an abstract representation space, the model focuses on task-relevant semantics while abstracting away surface-level linguistic variability. In a strictly controlled comparison against standard token-space VLM training with the same vision encoder and training data, VL-JEPA achieves stronger performance while having 50% fewer trainable parameters. At inference time, a lightweight text decoder is invoked only when needed to translate VL-JEPA predicted embeddings into text. We show that VL-JEPA natively supports selective decoding that reduces the number of decoding operations by 2.85x while maintaining similar performance compared to non-adaptive uniform decoding. Beyond generation, the VL-JEPA's embedding space naturally supports open-vocabulary classification, text-to-video retrieval, and discriminative VQA without any architecture modification. On eight video classification and eight video retrieval datasets, the average performance VL-JEPA surpasses that of CLIP, SigLIP2, and Perception Encoder. At the same time, the model achieves comparable performance as classical VLMs (InstructBLIP, QwenVL) on four VQA datasets: GQA, TallyQA, POPE and POPEv2, despite only having 1.6B parameters.

Motivation: 现有视频分割数据集过度依赖静态属性，允许单帧识别目标，而忽略了运动线索的分析价值，需要建立专门针对运动表达的数据集。

Method: 构建包含33,072条运动表达标注的MeViS数据集（8,171对象/2,006视频），包含文本/音频多模态数据和复杂场景。基准测试15种方法（如RVOS/AVOS/RMOT）并改进LMPM++。

Conclusion: MeViS为运动驱动的视频理解提供了基准平台，揭示了时序运动建模和多模态对齐的重要性，未来可探索视频-captioning联动等方向。

Abstract: This paper proposes a large-scale multi-modal dataset for referring motion expression video segmentation, focusing on segmenting and tracking target objects in videos based on language description of objects' motions. Existing referring video segmentation datasets often focus on salient objects and use language expressions rich in static attributes, potentially allowing the target object to be identified in a single frame. Such datasets underemphasize the role of motion in both videos and languages. To explore the feasibility of using motion expressions and motion reasoning clues for pixel-level video understanding, we introduce MeViS, a dataset containing 33,072 human-annotated motion expressions in both text and audio, covering 8,171 objects in 2,006 videos of complex scenarios. We benchmark 15 existing methods across 4 tasks supported by MeViS, including 6 referring video object segmentation (RVOS) methods, 3 audio-guided video object segmentation (AVOS) methods, 2 referring multi-object tracking (RMOT) methods, and 4 video captioning methods for the newly introduced referring motion expression generation (RMEG) task. The results demonstrate weaknesses and limitations of existing methods in addressing motion expression-guided video understanding. We further analyze the challenges and propose an approach LMPM++ for RVOS/AVOS/RMOT that achieves new state-of-the-art results. Our dataset provides a platform that facilitates the development of motion expression-guided video understanding algorithms in complex video scenes. The proposed MeViS dataset and the method's source code are publicly available at https://henghuiding.com/MeViS/

Motivation: 解决自动驾驶中多摄像头数据处理的计算瓶颈，并减少对复杂3D结构先验（如BEV、占据空间）的依赖，提升可扩展性和效率。

Method: 使用可学习的场景标记（scene tokens）联合编码跨摄像头和时间步的图像信息，通过几何无关的设计直接从数据学习紧凑表示，避免显式3D归纳偏置。

Result: 在20,000小时数据集上，Flex的推理吞吐量提升2.2倍，驾驶性能显著优于现有方法，且场景标记自发具备无监督的场景分解能力。

Conclusion: 数据驱动的联合编码策略在自动驾驶场景表征上优于依赖3D先验的方法，为可扩展、高效的系统设计提供了新路径。

Abstract: We present Flex, an efficient and effective scene encoder that addresses the computational bottleneck of processing high-volume multi-camera data in end-to-end autonomous driving. Flex employs a small set of learnable scene tokens to jointly encode information from all image tokens across different cameras and timesteps. By design, our approach is geometry-agnostic, learning a compact scene representation directly from data without relying on the explicit 3D inductive biases, such as Bird-Eye-View (BEV), occupancy or tri-plane representations, which are common in prior work. This holistic encoding strategy aggressively compresses the visual input for the downstream Large Language Model (LLM) based policy model. Evaluated on a large-scale proprietary dataset of 20,000 driving hours, our Flex achieves 2.2x greater inference throughput while improving driving performance by a large margin compared to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we show that these compact scene tokens develop an emergent capability for scene decomposition without any explicit supervision. Our findings challenge the prevailing assumption that 3D priors are necessary, demonstrating that a data-driven, joint encoding strategy offers a more scalable, efficient and effective path for future autonomous driving systems.

Conclusion: 聚类引导机制有效融合语义线索与频率域调制，使ClusIR在多样退化类型中实现卓越复原效果。

Abstract: All-in-One Image Restoration (AiOIR) aims to recover high-quality images from diverse degradations within a unified framework. However, existing methods often fail to explicitly model degradation types and struggle to adapt their restoration behavior to complex or mixed degradations. To address these issues, we propose ClusIR, a Cluster-Guided Image Restoration framework that explicitly models degradation semantics through learnable clustering and propagates cluster-aware cues across spatial and frequency domains for adaptive restoration. Specifically, ClusIR comprises two key components: a Probabilistic Cluster-Guided Routing Mechanism (PCGRM) and a Degradation-Aware Frequency Modulation Module (DAFMM). The proposed PCGRM disentangles degradation recognition from expert activation, enabling discriminative degradation perception and stable expert routing. Meanwhile, DAFMM leverages the cluster-guided priors to perform adaptive frequency decomposition and targeted modulation, collaboratively refining structural and textural representations for higher restoration fidelity. The cluster-guided synergy seamlessly bridges semantic cues with frequency-domain modulation, empowering ClusIR to attain remarkable restoration results across a wide range of degradations. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks validate that ClusIR reaches competitive performance under several scenarios.

TL;DR: E-RayZer是首个通过显式3D重建和渐进式学习课程进行自监督3D视觉预训练的大模型，显著优于RayZer和监督模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督预训练在语言和2D/视频领域已突破，但3D-aware表征学习仍依赖无标签多视角图像且缺乏有效方法，传统方法（如RayZer）通过潜在空间视角合成间接推断3D，存在几何不准确性。

Method: 1. 提出显式3D空间重建框架，直接推理几何属性；2. 设计无监督渐进式学习课程，按样本难度递增训练并整合异构数据源。

Result: 1. 在姿态估计任务上显著超越RayZer，表现接近/超过VGGT等监督模型；2. 迁移至3D下游任务时，表征性能优于DINOv3、CroCo v2等主流视觉预训练模型。

Conclusion: E-RayZer通过几何显式建模和课程学习，证明了自监督范式在3D-aware视觉预训练领域的有效性，为该领域提供了新范式。

Abstract: Self-supervised pre-training has revolutionized foundation models for languages, individual 2D images and videos, but remains largely unexplored for learning 3D-aware representations from multi-view images. In this paper, we present E-RayZer, a self-supervised large 3D Vision model that learns truly 3D-aware representations directly from unlabeled images. Unlike prior self-supervised methods such as RayZer that infer 3D indirectly through latent-space view synthesis, E-RayZer operates directly in 3D space, performing self-supervised 3D reconstruction with Explicit geometry. This formulation eliminates shortcut solutions and yields representations that are geometrically grounded. To ensure convergence and scalability, we introduce a novel fine-grained learning curriculum that organizes training from easy to hard samples and harmonizes heterogeneous data sources in an entirely unsupervised manner. Experiments demonstrate that E-RayZer significantly outperforms RayZer on pose estimation, matches or sometimes surpasses fully supervised reconstruction models such as VGGT. Furthermore, its learned representations outperform leading visual pre-training models (e.g., DINOv3, CroCo v2, VideoMAE V2, and RayZer) when transferring to 3D downstream tasks, establishing E-RayZer as a new paradigm for 3D-aware visual pre-training.

Result: 分组规模扩大提高生成质量，ImageNet-256x256上FID提升2.2%，度量与FID强相关。

Conclusion: 跨样本推理是有效的生成建模新机制，为扩散模型开辟新方向。

Abstract: In this work, we explore an untapped signal in diffusion model inference. While all previous methods generate images independently at inference, we instead ask if samples can be generated collaboratively. We propose Group Diffusion, unlocking the attention mechanism to be shared across images, rather than limited to just the patches within an image. This enables images to be jointly denoised at inference time, learning both intra and inter-image correspondence. We observe a clear scaling effect - larger group sizes yield stronger cross-sample attention and better generation quality. Furthermore, we introduce a qualitative measure to capture this behavior and show that its strength closely correlates with FID. Built on standard diffusion transformers, our GroupDiff achieves up to 32.2% FID improvement on ImageNet-256x256. Our work reveals cross-sample inference as an effective, previously unexplored mechanism for generative modeling.

Conclusion: Omni-Attribute作为首个开放词汇解耦式图像属性编码器，成功实现语义可控的视觉概念迁移，为复杂属性组合生成提供新范式。

Abstract: Visual concept personalization aims to transfer only specific image attributes, such as identity, expression, lighting, and style, into unseen contexts. However, existing methods rely on holistic embeddings from general-purpose image encoders, which entangle multiple visual factors and make it difficult to isolate a single attribute. This often leads to information leakage and incoherent synthesis. To address this limitation, we introduce Omni-Attribute, the first open-vocabulary image attribute encoder designed to learn high-fidelity, attribute-specific representations. Our approach jointly designs the data and model: (i) we curate semantically linked image pairs annotated with positive and negative attributes to explicitly teach the encoder what to preserve or suppress; and (ii) we adopt a dual-objective training paradigm that balances generative fidelity with contrastive disentanglement. The resulting embeddings prove effective for open-vocabulary attribute retrieval, personalization, and compositional generation, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StereoWalker improves robot navigation by combining stereo vision with mid-level vision modules, outperforming monocular end-to-end models with significantly less data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monocular end-to-end robot navigation models require vast pixel-to-action supervision, struggle with depth ambiguity, and lack robustness in dynamic scenes. The authors aim to reduce data dependency and improve performance by integrating stereo vision and established vision priors.

Method: StereoWalker uses stereo inputs and explicitly incorporates mid-level vision (depth estimation, dense tracking) to resolve depth ambiguity and enhance spatial reasoning. A large stereo navigation dataset with automated action annotations is created for training.

Result: StereoWalker achieves state-of-the-art performance using 1.5% of training data and surpasses it with full data. Stereo vision consistently outperforms monocular inputs in navigation accuracy.

Conclusion: Explicit stereo vision and mid-level modules reduce data requirements while improving navigation robustness, challenging the assumption that pure end-to-end models are optimal for robotics.

Abstract: The success of foundation models in language and vision motivated research in fully end-to-end robot navigation foundation models (NFMs). NFMs directly map monocular visual input to control actions and ignore mid-level vision modules (tracking, depth estimation, etc) entirely. While the assumption that vision capabilities will emerge implicitly is compelling, it requires large amounts of pixel-to-action supervision that are difficult to obtain. The challenge is especially pronounced in dynamic and unstructured settings, where robust navigation requires precise geometric and dynamic understanding, while the depth-scale ambiguity in monocular views further limits accurate spatial reasoning. In this paper, we show that relying on monocular vision and ignoring mid-level vision priors is inefficient.
  We present StereoWalker, which augments NFMs with stereo inputs and explicit mid-level vision such as depth estimation and dense pixel tracking. Our intuition is straightforward: stereo inputs resolve the depth-scale ambiguity, and modern mid-level vision models provide reliable geometric and motion structure in dynamic scenes. We also curate a large stereo navigation dataset with automatic action annotation from Internet stereo videos to support training of StereoWalker and to facilitate future research. Through our experiments, we find that mid-level vision enables StereoWalker to achieve a comparable performance as the state-of-the-art using only 1.5% of the training data, and surpasses the state-of-the-art using the full data. We also observe that stereo vision yields higher navigation performance than monocular input.

Conclusion: 通过基准测试、数据集和评估模型形成闭环评价体系，推动生成式世界模型从视觉拟真向行为可信发展的标准化进程。

Abstract: Generative world models are reshaping embodied AI, enabling agents to synthesize realistic 4D driving environments that look convincing but often fail physically or behaviorally. Despite rapid progress, the field still lacks a unified way to assess whether generated worlds preserve geometry, obey physics, or support reliable control. We introduce WorldLens, a full-spectrum benchmark evaluating how well a model builds, understands, and behaves within its generated world. It spans five aspects -- Generation, Reconstruction, Action-Following, Downstream Task, and Human Preference -- jointly covering visual realism, geometric consistency, physical plausibility, and functional reliability. Across these dimensions, no existing world model excels universally: those with strong textures often violate physics, while geometry-stable ones lack behavioral fidelity. To align objective metrics with human judgment, we further construct WorldLens-26K, a large-scale dataset of human-annotated videos with numerical scores and textual rationales, and develop WorldLens-Agent, an evaluation model distilled from these annotations to enable scalable, explainable scoring. Together, the benchmark, dataset, and agent form a unified ecosystem for measuring world fidelity -- standardizing how future models are judged not only by how real they look, but by how real they behave.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs use stochastic token-completion to mimic abductive reasoning via learned patterns, not genuine understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs perform true abductive reasoning or simulate it through training on human texts.

Method: Analyzes examples showing LLM outputs resemble abductive reasoning but lack truth grounding, verification, or semantic understanding.

Result: LLMs generate plausible explanations and ideas without actual reasoning, relying on pattern recognition trained on human-generated text.

Conclusion: LLMs can aid idea generation but require critical evaluation due to their inability to verify truths or perform real reasoning; discusses limitations and addresses objections.

Abstract: This article looks at how reasoning works in current Large Language Models (LLMs) that function using the token-completion method. It examines their stochastic nature and their similarity to human abductive reasoning. The argument is that these LLMs create text based on learned patterns rather than performing actual abductive reasoning. When their output seems abductive, this is largely because they are trained on human-generated texts that include reasoning structures. Examples are used to show how LLMs can produce plausible ideas, mimic commonsense reasoning, and give explanatory answers without being grounded in truth, semantics, verification, or understanding, and without performing any real abductive reasoning. This dual nature, where the models have a stochastic base but appear abductive in use, has important consequences for how LLMs are evaluated and applied. They can assist with generating ideas and supporting human thinking, but their outputs must be critically assessed because they cannot identify truth or verify their explanations. The article concludes by addressing five objections to these points, noting some limitations in the analysis, and offering an overall evaluation.

Abstract: We explore the use of small language models (SLMs) for automatic question generation as a complement to the prevalent use of their large counterparts in learning analytics research. We present a novel question generation pipeline that leverages both the text generation and the probabilistic reasoning abilities of SLMs to generate high-quality questions. Adopting a "generate-then-validate" strategy, our pipeline first performs expansive generation to create an abundance of candidate questions and refine them through selective validation based on novel probabilistic reasoning. We conducted two evaluation studies, one with seven human experts and the other with a large language model (LLM), to assess the quality of the generated questions. Most judges (humans or LLMs) agreed that the generated questions had clear answers and generally aligned well with the intended learning objectives. Our findings suggest that an SLM can effectively generate high-quality questions when guided by a well-designed pipeline that leverages its strengths.

TL;DR: 本研究提出DeepNews框架，解决大型语言模型在长文本生成中面临的低幻觉、深度逻辑一致性和个性化表达难以同时实现的核心问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成模型陷入统计平滑陷阱，忽视了专家写作所需的信息获取与结构化思维过程，导致在垂直领域应用受限。

Method: DeepNews框架包含三层核心架构：基于信源觅食理论的双粒度检索机制（10:1信息饱和比）、模式引导的战略规划（利用叙事骨架和原子块构建逻辑框架）、对抗约束提示技术（通过节奏破坏和逻辑迷雾打破模型平滑性）。

Result: 实验发现知识断崖现象：输入信息低于15,000字符时内容真实性骤降，超30,000字符时无幻觉率提升至85%以上。在中国科技媒体盲测中，基于旧代模型的DeepNews投稿接受率达25%，而GPT-5零样本生成为0%。

Conclusion: 通过显式建模专家认知过程，该框架突破传统生成范式，为垂直领域文本生成提供了兼顾真实性、逻辑性和个性化的解决方案。

Abstract: Central to long-form text generation in vertical domains is the "impossible trinity" confronting current large language models (LLMs): the simultaneous achievement of low hallucination, deep logical coherence, and personalized expression. This study establishes that this bottleneck arises from existing generative paradigms succumbing to the Statistical Smoothing Trap, a phenomenon that overlooks the high-entropy information acquisition and structured cognitive processes integral to expert-level writing. To address this limitation, we propose the DeepNews Framework, an agentic workflow that explicitly models the implicit cognitive processes of seasoned financial journalists. The framework integrates three core modules: first, a dual-granularity retrieval mechanism grounded in information foraging theory, which enforces a 10:1 saturated information input ratio to mitigate hallucinatory outputs; second, schema-guided strategic planning, a process leveraging domain expert knowledge bases (narrative schemas) and Atomic Blocks to forge a robust logical skeleton; third, adversarial constraint prompting, a technique deploying tactics including Rhythm Break and Logic Fog to disrupt the probabilistic smoothness inherent in model-generated text. Experiments delineate a salient Knowledge Cliff in deep financial reporting: content truthfulness collapses when retrieved context falls below 15,000 characters, while a high-redundancy input exceeding 30,000 characters stabilizes the Hallucination-Free Rate (HFR) above 85%. In an ecological validity blind test conducted with a top-tier Chinese technology media outlet, the DeepNews system--built on a previous-generation model (DeepSeek-V3-0324)-achieved a 25% submission acceptance rate, significantly outperforming the 0% acceptance rate of zero-shot generation by a state-of-the-art (SOTA) model (GPT-5).

Abstract: Personalized review response generation presents a significant challenge in domains where user information is limited, such as food delivery platforms. While large language models (LLMs) offer powerful text generation capabilities, they often produce generic responses when lacking contextual user data, reducing engagement and effectiveness. In this work, we propose a two-stage prompting framework that infers both explicit (e.g., user-stated preferences) and implicit (e.g., demographic or stylistic cues) personas directly from short review texts. These inferred persona attributes are then incorporated into the response generation prompt to produce user-tailored replies. To encourage diverse yet faithful generations, we adjust decoding temperature during inference. We evaluate our method using a real-world dataset collected from a Korean food delivery app, and assess its impact on precision, diversity, and semantic consistency. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of persona-augmented prompting in enhancing the relevance and personalization of automated responses without requiring model fine-tuning.

*Jules Lahmi,Alexis Roger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses adapting English-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to multilingual settings, comparing methods like translation pipelines, LoRA fine-tuning, and two-stage adaptation. Key findings identify dataset translation as a major bottleneck, emphasizing the need for improved translation strategies and native-language data collection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge accessibility gaps for non-English speakers by extending VLM capabilities beyond English-dominated advancements in AI.

Method: Evaluated three adaptation approaches: translation-based pipelines (automatic dataset translation), low-rank LoRA fine-tuning, and a two-stage strategy separating vision/language adaptation. Tested on multilingual benchmarks (translated into target languages) with native expert assessments.

Result: Dataset translation quality significantly limits model performance due to noisy training/evaluation data, with different adaptation methods showing varying trade-offs in computational cost and effectiveness.

Conclusion: Focus should shift toward native-language dataset collection and enhanced translation techniques to improve multilingual VLM development.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has made great progress in recent years, particularly in the development of Vision--Language Models (VLMs) that understand both visual and textual data. However, these advancements remain largely limited to English, reducing their accessibility for non--English speakers. It is essential to extend these capabilities to a broader range of languages. This paper explores the challenges of adapting an English-trained VLM to different languages. To this end, we will explore and compare different methods for their performance and computational cost. We consider a translation-based pipeline, LoRA finetuning, and a two-stage finetuning strategy that separates vision adaptation from language adaptation. To evaluate these methods, we use a combination of standard multimodal benchmarks translated into the target language and manual assessments by native experts. The results reveal that dataset translation remains a major bottleneck in multilingual VLM performance, with data quality limiting the effectiveness of training and evaluation. These findings suggest that future efforts should focus on native-language dataset collection and improved translation strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开源代码智能体在工业级代码库处理中存在局限性，而闭源方案缺乏可扩展性研究。需要兼顾透明度与工业级性能的AI软件工程解决方案。

Method: 构建Confucius SDK平台框架：
1. 三级开发视角（AX/UX/DX）
2. 分层工作记忆系统
3. 永久笔记学习系统
4. 模块化工具扩展
5. 元智能体自动配置系统（build-test-improve循环）

Result: 在SWE-Bench-Pro基准测试中实现54.3%的Resolve@1指标，显著超越现有代码智能体，验证了平台在实际软件工程任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过开源SDK和CCA实例，建立了可解释的工业级AI智能体开发范式，在研究原型与生产系统之间架设桥梁，为大规模智能体开发提供可复现的技术框架。

Abstract: Real-world AI software engineering demands coding agents that can reason over massive repositories, maintain durable memory across and within long sessions, and robustly coordinate complex toolchains at test time. Existing open-source coding agents provide transparency but frequently fall short when pushed to these industrial-scale workloads, while proprietary coding agents offer strong practical performance but limited extensibility, interpretability, and controllability. We present the Confucius Code Agent (CCA), an open-sourced AI software engineer that can operate at an industrial scale. CCA is built atop the Confucius SDK, an open-sourced agent development platform designed around three complementary perspectives: Agent Experience (AX), User Experience (UX), and Developer Experience (DX). The SDK introduces a unified orchestrator with hierarchical working memory for long-context reasoning, a persistent note-taking system for cross-session continual learning, and a modular extension module for robust tool use. Moreover, a meta-agent automates the synthesis, evaluation, and refinement of agent configurations through a build-test-improve loop, enabling rapid agent development on new tasks, environments, and tool stacks. Instantiated on Confucius SDK with these mechanisms, CCA delivers strong performance on real-world software engineering tasks. On SWE-Bench-Pro, CCA achieves a state-of-the-art Resolve@1 performance of 54.3%, substantially improving over prior coding agents. Together, the Confucius SDK and CCA provide a transparent, extensible, and reproducible foundation for AI agents, bridge gaps between research prototypes and production-grade systems, and support agent development and deployment at industrial scale.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了SWAA方法，通过组合五种策略，在无需重新预训练的前提下，使全注意力机制预训练的LLMs有效适应滑动窗口注意力，解决长上下文推理效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer的自注意力机制计算复杂度与输入长度平方相关，导致长上下文推理成本高昂。滑动窗口注意力虽将复杂度降为线性，但直接用于全注意力预训练模型会因训练-推理不匹配导致性能严重下降。

Method: 提出SWAA混合策略：(1)预填充阶段使用SWA；(2)保留sink tokens；(3)交替FA/SWA层；(4)思维链推理（CoT）；(5)微调模型参数。

Result: 实验发现单一方法无法解决适配问题，但特定组合能协同恢复原始长上下文性能。通过系统分析了不同SWAA配置的性能-效率权衡，提出分场景适配方案。

Conclusion: FA预训练LLMs可有效适配SWA推理，无需重新训练，但需组合五种方法形成系统优化策略。论文为不同应用场景提供了实践指南。

Abstract: The self-attention mechanism in Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) scales quadratically with input length, making long-context inference expensive. Sliding window attention (SWA) reduces this cost to linear complexity, but naively enabling complete SWA at inference-time for models pretrained with full attention (FA) causes severe long-context performance degradation due to training-inference mismatch. This makes us wonder: Can FA-pretrained LLMs be well adapted to SWA without pretraining? We investigate this by proposing Sliding Window Attention Adaptation (SWAA), a set of practical recipes that combine five methods for better adaptation: (1) applying SWA only during prefilling; (2) preserving "sink" tokens; (3) interleaving FA/SWA layers; (4) chain-of-thought (CoT); and (5) fine-tuning. Our experiments show that SWA adaptation is feasible while non-trivial: no single method suffices, yet specific synergistic combinations effectively recover the original long-context performance. We further analyze the performance-efficiency trade-offs of different SWAA configurations and provide recommended recipes for diverse scenarios.

### [88] [Cooperative Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Question Answering: Mutual Information Exchange and Ranking by Contrasting Layers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10422)
*Youmin Ko,Sungjong Seo,Hyunjoon Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoopRAG is a collaborative retrieval-augmented generation framework that enhances question answering accuracy by integrating a retriever model and large language model (LLM) through iterative knowledge exchange, sub-question decomposition, and layer-wise document reranking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods suffer from incorrect document retrievals and hallucinations in both simple and multi-hop question answering tasks, necessitating a more robust solution.

Method: CoopRAG introduces four key steps: (1) decomposing questions into sub-questions and masked reasoning chains, (2) retrieving documents augmented with these sub-questions, (3) reranking documents via intra-retriever layer contrast, and (4) reconstructing reasoning chains by filling masked positions using LLMs, enabling bidirectional cooperation between the retriever and LLM.

Result: CoopRAG surpasses state-of-the-art QA methods across three multi-hop QA datasets and one simple QA dataset, achieving superior performance in both retrieval accuracy and final question answering tasks.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates that mutual cooperation between retrievers and LLMs through structured reasoning chains and layer-wise optimization can significantly mitigate retrieval errors and hallucinations in QA systems.

Abstract: Since large language models (LLMs) have a tendency to generate factually inaccurate output, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has gained significant attention as a key means to mitigate this downside of harnessing only LLMs. However, existing RAG methods for simple and multi-hop question answering (QA) are still prone to incorrect retrievals and hallucinations. To address these limitations, we propose CoopRAG, a novel RAG framework for the question answering task in which a retriever and an LLM work cooperatively with each other by exchanging informative knowledge, and the earlier and later layers of the retriever model work cooperatively with each other to accurately rank the retrieved documents relevant to a given query. In this framework, we (i) unroll a question into sub-questions and a reasoning chain in which uncertain positions are masked, (ii) retrieve the documents relevant to the question augmented with the sub-questions and the reasoning chain, (iii) rerank the documents by contrasting layers of the retriever, and (iv) reconstruct the reasoning chain by filling the masked positions via the LLM. Our experiments demonstrate that CoopRAG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art QA methods on three multi-hop QA datasets as well as a simple QA dataset in terms of both the retrieval and QA performances. Our code is available.\footnote{https://github.com/meaningful96/CoopRAG}

The model supports direct answering and reasoning-trace generation, using a Cyrillic-dense tokenizer and an adapted EAGLE speculative-decoding pipeline to reduce latency. To enable reproducible and extensible research, we release the model weights, the T-Wix 500k instruction corpus, the T-Math reasoning benchmark, and the EAGLE weights on Hugging Face. These resources allow users to study Russian-language reasoning and to extend or adapt both the model and the inference pipeline. A public web demo exposes reasoning and non-reasoning modes and illustrates the speedups achieved by our inference stack across domains. T-pro 2.0 thus serves as an accessible open system for building and evaluating efficient, practical Russian LLM applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种名为SRAP的框架，旨在通过语义重建技术检测和恢复被对抗性抄袭（如使用伪造术语）所掩盖的科学文献原始内容。传统方法依赖静态黑名单或通用语言模型，存在检测率低和无法追溯来源的问题，而SRAP结合领域专用模型和向量检索技术，显著提升了检测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗性文本生成技术（如自动化改写工具）威胁科学文献的可靠性，传统方法（如静态黑名单或通用模型）难以处理新颖的伪装手段，且无法追溯抄袭来源。因此需要一种可检测并恢复原始术语的新框架，以应对科学文本中术语密集、结构复杂的挑战。

Method: SRAP采用两阶段架构：（1）使用领域专用的SciBERT模型，通过词元级伪困惑度进行统计异常检测；（2）结合FAISS向量检索和SBERT句级对齐技术，实现基于来源语义重建。实验对比了零样本基线方法，并测试不同阈值策略在术语密集文本中的鲁棒性。

Result: 在对抗性科学文本平行语料库的实验中，零样本基线方法完全失效（恢复准确率为0.00%），而SRAP的检索增强方法达到23.67%的恢复准确率。此外，静态决策边界在高方差术语密集文本中表现优于动态阈值方法。

Conclusion: SRAP框架首次实现了对抗性抄袭的检测与原始术语的数学恢复，并通过链接伪造表达式到可能来源文档，支持科学文本的法医学分析。研究强调了领域专用模型和静态阈值对科学文献可靠性的重要性。

Abstract: The integrity and reliability of scientific literature is facing a serious threat by adversarial text generation techniques, specifically from the use of automated paraphrasing tools to mask plagiarism. These tools generate "tortured phrases", statistically improbable synonyms (e.g. "counterfeit consciousness" for "artificial intelligence"), that preserve the local grammar while obscuring the original source. Most existing detection methods depend heavily on static blocklists or general-domain language models, which suffer from high false-negative rates for novel obfuscations and cannot determine the source of the plagiarized content. In this paper, we propose Semantic Reconstruction of Adversarial Plagiarism (SRAP), a framework designed not only to detect these anomalies but to mathematically recover the original terminology. We use a two-stage architecture: (1) statistical anomaly detection with a domain-specific masked language model (SciBERT) using token-level pseudo-perplexity, and (2) source-based semantic reconstruction using dense vector retrieval (FAISS) and sentence-level alignment (SBERT). Experiments on a parallel corpus of adversarial scientific text show that while zero-shot baselines fail completely (0.00 percent restoration accuracy), our retrieval-augmented approach achieves 23.67 percent restoration accuracy, significantly outperforming baseline methods. We also show that static decision boundaries are necessary for robust detection in jargon-heavy scientific text, since dynamic thresholding fails under high variance. SRAP enables forensic analysis by linking obfuscated expressions back to their most probable source documents.

The system combines Large Language Models (LLMs), a knowledge graph-enhanced BERT (KG-BERT), and a bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) with attention to classify students' cognitive and affective states in real time. Unlike prior chatbots limited to either tutoring or affective support, our approach leverages multimodal data-including textual semantics, prosodic speech features, and temporal behavioral trends-to infer engagement, stress, and conceptual understanding. A pilot study with university students demonstrated improved motivation, reduced stress, and moderate academic gains compared to baseline methods. These results underline the promise of integrating semantic reasoning, multimodal fusion, and temporal modeling to support adaptive, student-centered educational interventions.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨大型语言模型（LLMs）在仅训练于表层形式的情况下，是否能通过句法结构的对比（如主谓倒装和寄生空位许可）展现对基础结构敏感的能力。结果显示，LLMs能可靠区分语法正确与错误变体，表明其训练中自发形成了结构敏感性而非依赖线性顺序。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统生成语法将语法性对比（如主谓倒装）作为内部层阶语法的证据，但LLMs无需显式编码结构即可处理语言。研究旨在验证这些模型是否通过表层形式训练隐含捕获了结构敏感性。

Method: 聚焦两种经典句法结构：测试主语边界的主谓倒装和测试抽象依存关系的寄生空位许可。使用GPT-4和LLaMA-3等模型，通过可接受度评分提示进行评估。

Result: LLMs在两种结构中均可靠区分语法正确与错误变体，证明其敏感于结构而不仅是线性顺序。

Conclusion: 表层形式的预测训练可产生区别于人类认知知识的结构泛化能力，表明LLMs无需显式编码即可实现功能性句法敏感。

Abstract: What counts as evidence for syntactic structure? In traditional generative grammar, systematic contrasts in grammaticality such as subject-auxiliary inversion and the licensing of parasitic gaps are taken as evidence for an internal, hierarchical grammar. In this paper, we test whether large language models (LLMs), trained only on surface forms, reproduce these contrasts in ways that imply an underlying structural representation.
  We focus on two classic constructions: subject-auxiliary inversion (testing recognition of the subject boundary) and parasitic gap licensing (testing abstract dependency structure). We evaluate models including GPT-4 and LLaMA-3 using prompts eliciting acceptability ratings. Results show that LLMs reliably distinguish between grammatical and ungrammatical variants in both constructions, and as such support that they are sensitive to structure and not just linear order. Structural generalizations, distinct from cognitive knowledge, emerge from predictive training on surface forms, suggesting functional sensitivity to syntax without explicit encoding.

*Iñaki Lacunza,José Javier Saiz,Alexander Shvets,Aitor Gonzalez-Agirre,Marta Villegas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses the imbalance in multilingual large language models (LLMs) caused by over-reliance on high-resource languages. The authors propose XDoGE (an extended domain-reweighing algorithm) and data rescaling with continual pre-training (CPT) to improve performance on low-resource languages. They release a new IberianLLM-7B-Instruct model focused on Iberian languages and English.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs perform poorly on mid-/low-resource languages due to training data imbalances dominated by high-resource languages like English. Existing approaches for language distribution optimization have not been effectively extended to multilingual setups.

Method: 1. Developed XDoGE algorithm with a proxy model for multilingual language distribution optimization; 2. Implemented data rescaling and trained full-size models from scratch/with CPT; 3. Conducted experiments on 6 languages (English, Spanish, Portuguese, Catalan, Galician, Basque) with different resource levels; 4. Evaluated using IberoBench framework.

Result: Demonstrated successful mitigation of language imbalance through (1) effective data repetition for minor languages and (2) strategic undersampling of dominant languages. Achieved improved performance across all resource levels, validated through the release of a new publicly available IberianLLM-7B-Instruct model.

Conclusion: The XDoGE algorithm and CPT-based approach significantly improves multilingual model performance across varying resource levels. The study confirms that optimized language distribution during training, combined with continual pre-training, produces superior results in typologically diverse language families. The open-sourced IberianLLM-7B-Instruct model provides a high-quality, balanced resource for Iberian languages.

Abstract: Current large language models (LLMs) are trained on massive amounts of text data, primarily from a few dominant languages. Studies suggest that this over-reliance on high-resource languages, such as English, hampers LLM performance in mid- and low-resource languages. To mitigate this problem, we propose to (i) optimize the language distribution by training a small proxy model within a domain-reweighing DoGE algorithm that we extend to XDoGE for a multilingual setup, and (ii) rescale the data and train a full-size model with the established language weights either from scratch or within a continual pre-training phase (CPT). We target six languages possessing a variety of geographic and intra- and inter-language-family relations, namely, English and Spanish (high-resource), Portuguese and Catalan (mid-resource), Galician and Basque (low-resource). We experiment with Salamandra-2b, which is a promising model for these languages. We investigate the effects of substantial data repetition on minor languages and under-sampling on dominant languages using the IberoBench framework for quantitative evaluation. Finally, we release a new promising IberianLLM-7B-Instruct model centering on Iberian languages and English that we pretrained from scratch and further improved using CPT with the XDoGE weights.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 因果推理需多跳推导且易受输入干扰，传统ICL表现不足，需探索适合的模型结构提高可靠性。

Method: 对比零/少样本ICL设置下，各类架构（Bert、T5、GPT）在自然语言与非自然语言场景的因果推理表现，并进行针对性微调测试。

Result: 仅ICL不足以完成多跳因果推理；解码器模型对分布偏移敏感，而编码器类模型微调后在非自然语言任务中泛化性更优，尤其在小规模数据场景。

Conclusion: 对短周期、高鲁棒性场景，编码器/编码器-解码器模型配合适当微调更优，解码器模型仅在大规模场景下能匹敌

Abstract: In context learning (ICL) underpins recent advances in large language models (LLMs), although its role and performance in causal reasoning remains unclear. Causal reasoning demands multihop composition and strict conjunctive control, and reliance on spurious lexical relations of the input could provide misleading results. We hypothesize that, due to their ability to project the input into a latent space, encoder and encoder decoder architectures are better suited for said multihop conjunctive reasoning versus decoder only models. To do this, we compare fine-tuned versions of all the aforementioned architectures with zero and few shot ICL in both natural language and non natural language scenarios. We find that ICL alone is insufficient for reliable causal reasoning, often overfocusing on irrelevant input features. In particular, decoder only models are noticeably brittle to distributional shifts, while finetuned encoder and encoder decoder models can generalize more robustly across our tests, including the non natural language split. Both architectures are only matched or surpassed by decoder only architectures at large scales. We conclude by noting that for cost effective, short horizon robust causal reasoning, encoder or encoder decoder architectures with targeted finetuning are preferable.

Abstract: Reward modeling has become a cornerstone of aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. Yet, when extended to subjective and open-ended domains such as role play, existing reward models exhibit severe degradation, struggling to capture nuanced and persona-grounded human judgments. To address this gap, we introduce RoleRMBench, the first systematic benchmark for reward modeling in role-playing dialogue, covering seven fine-grained capabilities from narrative management to role consistency and engagement. Evaluation on RoleRMBench reveals large and consistent gaps between general-purpose reward models and human judgment, particularly in narrative and stylistic dimensions. We further propose RoleRM, a reward model trained with Continuous Implicit Preferences (CIP), which reformulates subjective evaluation as continuous consistent pairwise supervision under multiple structuring strategies. Comprehensive experiments show that RoleRM surpasses strong open- and closed-source reward models by over 24% on average, demonstrating substantial gains in narrative coherence and stylistic fidelity. Our findings highlight the importance of continuous preference representation and annotation consistency, establishing a foundation for subjective alignment in human-centered dialogue systems.

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in multimodal large language models, agricultural applications remain constrained by the lack of multilingual speech data, unified multimodal architectures, and comprehensive evaluation benchmarks. To address these challenges, we present AgriGPT-Omni, an agricultural omni-framework that integrates speech, vision, and text in a unified framework. First, we construct a scalable data synthesis and collection pipeline that converts agricultural texts and images into training data, resulting in the largest agricultural speech dataset to date, including 492K synthetic and 1.4K real speech samples across six languages. Second, based on this, we train the first agricultural omni-model via a three-stage paradigm: textual knowledge injection, progressive multimodal alignment, and GRPO-based reinforcement learning, enabling unified reasoning across languages and modalities. Third, we propose AgriBench-Omni-2K, the first tri-modal benchmark for agriculture, covering diverse speech-vision-text tasks and multilingual slices, with standardized protocols and reproducible tools. Experiments show that AgriGPT-Omni significantly outperforms general-purpose baselines on multilingual and multimodal reasoning as well as real-world speech understanding. All models, data, benchmarks, and code will be released to promote reproducible research, inclusive agricultural intelligence, and sustainable AI development for low-resource regions.

*Smiljana Antonijevic Ubois*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study addresses cultural and linguistic biases in AI for low-resource languages like Serbian, proposing a 'Data Care' framework to embed bias mitigation early in model development through cultural and ethical corpus design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate why LLMs trained on dominant languages perpetuate biases against low-resource languages (e.g., Serbian) due to historical destruction of textual heritage and reductive engineering approaches prioritizing functionality over cultural nuance.

Method: Conducted semi-structured interviews with ten scholars and practitioners (linguists, AI developers) to trace structural, historical, and sociotechnical factors affecting Serbian language technology, identifying systemic challenges and proposing Data Care as a mitigation strategy.

Result: Identified key challenges: superficial transliteration, English model dependency, data bias, and culturally generic datasets. Proposed Data Care principles (Collective Benefit, Authority, Responsibility, Ethics) to integrate bias mitigation into corpus design and governance.

Conclusion: Data Care offers a replicable model to address power imbalances in LLM development for low-resource languages, emphasizing culturally grounded, sustainable technology through proactive ethical design rather than post-hoc fixes.

Abstract: Large language models are commonly trained on dominant languages like English, and their representation of low resource languages typically reflects cultural and linguistic biases present in the source language materials. Using the Serbian language as a case, this study examines the structural, historical, and sociotechnical factors shaping language technology development for low resource languages in the AI age. Drawing on semi structured interviews with ten scholars and practitioners, including linguists, digital humanists, and AI developers, it traces challenges rooted in historical destruction of Serbian textual heritage, intensified by contemporary issues that drive reductive, engineering first approaches prioritizing functionality over linguistic nuance. These include superficial transliteration, reliance on English-trained models, data bias, and dataset curation lacking cultural specificity. To address these challenges, the study proposes Data Care, a framework grounded in CARE principles (Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, and Ethics), that reframes bias mitigation from a post hoc technical fix to an integral component of corpus design, annotation, and governance, and positions Data Care as a replicable model for building inclusive, sustainable, and culturally grounded language technologies in contexts where traditional LLM development reproduces existing power imbalances and cultural blind spots.

Result: 成功降低了文本数据中的表现偏见和显性刻板印象，但对0.6B-8B参数模型的微调实验表明，当前偏见评估方法存在显著局限性，模型偏见缓解效果不具一致性。

Conclusion: 数据去偏流程有效性得到验证，但现有模型偏见评估体系存在系统性缺陷，强调需开发更精准的数据操作方法来针对性解决模型偏见问题。

Abstract: Textual data used to train large language models (LLMs) exhibits multifaceted bias manifestations encompassing harmful language and skewed demographic distributions. Regulations such as the European AI Act require identifying and mitigating biases against protected groups in data, with the ultimate goal of preventing unfair model outputs. However, practical guidance and operationalization are lacking. We propose a comprehensive data bias detection and mitigation pipeline comprising four components that address two data bias types, namely representation bias and (explicit) stereotypes for a configurable sensitive attribute. First, we leverage LLM-generated word lists created based on quality criteria to detect relevant group labels. Second, representation bias is quantified using the Demographic Representation Score. Third, we detect and mitigate stereotypes using sociolinguistically informed filtering. Finally, we compensate representation bias through Grammar- and Context-Aware Counterfactual Data Augmentation. We conduct a two-fold evaluation using the examples of gender, religion and age. First, the effectiveness of each individual component on data debiasing is evaluated through human validation and baseline comparison. The findings demonstrate that we successfully reduce representation bias and (explicit) stereotypes in a text dataset. Second, the effect of data debiasing on model bias reduction is evaluated by bias benchmarking of several models (0.6B-8B parameters), fine-tuned on the debiased text dataset. This evaluation reveals that LLMs fine-tuned on debiased data do not consistently show improved performance on bias benchmarks, exposing critical gaps in current evaluation methodologies and highlighting the need for targeted data manipulation to address manifested model bias.

Motivation: 当前基于结果的验证器（OVs）无法检查长推理链中间步骤的可靠性，而基于过程的验证器（PVs）受限于高质量标注数据的稀缺。

Method: 提出结合结果导向和过程验证的OPV，并通过迭代主动学习框架（结合拒绝微调和强化学习与可验证奖励）降低标注成本。

Result: OPV在多个任务上超越大模型（如Qwen3-Max-Preview F1 83.1 vs 76.3），在合成数据集检测假阳性率达专家水平，与策略模型结合后使DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B的AIME2025准确率从55.2%提升至73.3%。

Conclusion: OPV通过低标注成本实现高效验证，适用于大规模标注场景并能显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant progress in solving complex reasoning tasks by Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). This advancement is also inseparable from the oversight automated by reliable verifiers. However, current outcome-based verifiers (OVs) are unable to inspect the unreliable intermediate steps in the long reasoning chains of thought (CoTs). Meanwhile, current process-based verifiers (PVs) have difficulties in reliably detecting errors in the complex long CoTs, limited by the scarcity of high-quality annotations due to the prohibitive costs of human annotations. Therefore, we propose the \textbf{O}utcome-based \textbf{P}rocess \textbf{V}erifier (OPV), which verifies the rationale process of summarized outcomes from long CoTs to achieve both accurate and efficient verification and enable large-scale annotation. To empower the proposed verifier, we adopt an iterative active learning framework with expert annotations to progressively improve the verification capability of OPV with fewer annotation costs. Specifically, in each iteration, the most uncertain cases of the current best OPV are annotated and then subsequently used to train a new OPV through Rejection Fine-Tuning (RFT) and RLVR for the next round. Extensive experiments demonstrate OPV's superior performance and broad applicability. It achieves new state-of-the-art results on our held-out \textsc{\thisbench}, outperforming much larger open-source models such as Qwen3-Max-Preview with an F1 score of 83.1 compared to 76.3. Furthermore, OPV effectively detects false positives within synthetic dataset, closely align with expert assessment. When collaborating with policy models, OPV consistently yields performance gains, e.g., raising the accuracy of DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B from 55.2\% to 73.3\% on AIME2025 as the compute budget scales.

Abstract: Emergency speech recognition systems exhibit systematic performance degradation on non-standard English varieties, creating a critical gap in services for Caribbean populations. We present TRIDENT (Transcription and Routing Intelligence for Dispatcher-Empowered National Triage), a three-layer dispatcher-support architecture designed to structure emergency call inputs for human application of established triage protocols (the ESI for routine operations and START for mass casualty events), even when automatic speech recognition fails.
  The system combines Caribbean-accent-tuned ASR, local entity extraction via large language models, and bio-acoustic distress detection to provide dispatchers with three complementary signals: transcription confidence, structured clinical entities, and vocal stress indicators. Our key insight is that low ASR confidence, rather than representing system failure, serves as a valuable queue prioritization signal -- particularly when combined with elevated vocal distress markers indicating a caller in crisis whose speech may have shifted toward basilectal registers. A complementary insight drives the entity extraction layer: trained responders and composed bystanders may report life-threatening emergencies without elevated vocal stress, requiring semantic analysis to capture clinical indicators that paralinguistic features miss.
  We describe the architectural design, theoretical grounding in psycholinguistic research on stress-induced code-switching, and deployment considerations for offline operation during disaster scenarios. This work establishes a framework for accent-resilient emergency AI that ensures Caribbean voices receive equitable access to established national triage protocols. Empirical validation on Caribbean emergency calls remains future work.

Abstract: Achieving high-performing language models which include medium- and lower-resource languages remains a challenge. Massively multilingual models still underperform compared to language-specific adaptations, especially at smaller model scales. In this work, we investigate scaling as an efficient strategy for adapting pretrained models to new target languages. Through comprehensive scaling ablations with approximately FLOP-matched models, we test whether upscaling an English base model enables more effective and resource-efficient adaptation than standard continued pretraining. We find that, once exposed to sufficient target-language data, larger upscaled models can match or surpass the performance of smaller models continually pretrained on much more data, demonstrating the benefits of scaling for data efficiency. Scaling also helps preserve the base model's capabilities in English, thus reducing catastrophic forgetting. Finally, we explore whether such scaled, language-specific models can be merged to construct modular and flexible multilingual systems. We find that while merging remains less effective than joint multilingual training, upscaled merges perform better than smaller ones. We observe large performance differences across merging methods, suggesting potential for improvement through merging approaches specialized for language-level integration.

Motivation: 印度临床场景中用户普遍使用拉丁化文字输入本地语言，但现有研究缺乏对这种文字形式对医疗LLM影响的实证分析，可能导致高风险医疗场景中的潜在故障。

Method: 在真实用户生成的跨5种印度语言及尼泊尔语的分诊数据集上评估主流LLM性能，通过对比拉丁化文字与原生文字的F1分数差异进行分析

Result: 拉丁化文本导致模型性能下降5-12个F1分数，在合作机构的应用场景中可能引发约200万次分诊误判，但模型能准确理解语义意图，问题主要出现在噪声环境下的最终分类决策

Conclusion: LLM在医疗健康系统中的文字处理鲁棒性存在关键盲点，单纯语义理解准确率无法反映实际应用中的可靠性风险

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes clinical applications in India. In many such settings, speakers of Indian languages frequently communicate using romanized text rather than native scripts, yet existing research rarely evaluates this orthographic variation using real-world data. We investigate how romanization impacts the reliability of LLMs in a critical domain: maternal and newborn healthcare triage. We benchmark leading LLMs on a real-world dataset of user-generated queries spanning five Indian languages and Nepali. Our results reveal consistent degradation in performance for romanized messages, with F1 scores trailing those of native scripts by 5-12 points. At our partner maternal health organization in India, this gap could cause nearly 2 million excess errors in triage. Crucially, this performance gap by scripts is not due to a failure in clinical reasoning. We demonstrate that LLMs often correctly infer the semantic intent of romanized queries. Nevertheless, their final classification outputs remain brittle in the presence of orthographic noise in romanized inputs. Our findings highlight a critical safety blind spot in LLM-based health systems: models that appear to understand romanized input may still fail to act on it reliably.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack comprehensive evaluation of factual accuracy in language models. This work aims to address gaps in measuring factuality across diverse scenarios, including multimodal inputs, internal knowledge, search integration, and document grounding.

Method: Four sub-leaderboards (Multimodal, Parametric, Search, Grounding v2) were designed to assess different factuality aspects. Automated judge models scored responses, and final scores averaged sub-leaderboard results. Public/private splits were implemented to ensure integrity.

Result: A unified benchmark suite was established, featuring standardized evaluation metrics for factual accuracy. Improved judge models for document grounding and integration of search APIs were key technical outcomes, hosted publicly on Kaggle.

Conclusion: FACTS Leaderboard provides a balanced, robust framework for assessing factual generation in language models. Its active maintenance and hybrid public-private structure enable ongoing community participation while preserving evaluation integrity.

Abstract: We introduce The FACTS Leaderboard, an online leaderboard suite and associated set of benchmarks that comprehensively evaluates the ability of language models to generate factually accurate text across diverse scenarios. The suite provides a holistic measure of factuality by aggregating the performance of models on four distinct sub-leaderboards: (1) FACTS Multimodal, which measures the factuality of responses to image-based questions; (2) FACTS Parametric, which assesses models' world knowledge by answering closed-book factoid questions from internal parameters; (3) FACTS Search, which evaluates factuality in information-seeking scenarios, where the model must use a search API; and (4) FACTS Grounding (v2), which evaluates whether long-form responses are grounded in provided documents, featuring significantly improved judge models. Each sub-leaderboard employs automated judge models to score model responses, and the final suite score is an average of the four components, designed to provide a robust and balanced assessment of a model's overall factuality. The FACTS Leaderboard Suite will be actively maintained, containing both public and private splits to allow for external participation while guarding its integrity.

Motivation: 传统Transformer模型在推理能力上较弱，而LLM成本较高且易受上下文干扰。论文旨在通过数据驱动的方式融合二者互补优势，平衡性能与效率。

Method: 将ML模型的嵌入向量与LLM通过结构化提示生成的类别概率进行拼接，输入紧凑FusionMLP进行端到端训练。提供AutoFusionClassifier简化流程，支持多LLM集成与低成本部署。

Result: 在AG News和Reuters-21578上分别达到92.4%与92.3%准确率，实验显示：①LLM与ML模型融合显著优于单独使用任一模型 ②通过调整LLM调用次数可灵活控制成本-性能权衡

Conclusion: 该方法验证了LLM推理能力与传统模型效率互补的有效性，通过参数共享机制和端到端训练实现鲁棒的跨领域适配，为资源约束场景提供实用解决方案。

Abstract: LabelFusion is a fusion ensemble for text classification that learns to combine a traditional transformer-based classifier (e.g., RoBERTa) with one or more Large Language Models (LLMs such as OpenAI GPT, Google Gemini, or DeepSeek) to deliver accurate and cost-aware predictions across multi-class and multi-label tasks. The package provides a simple high-level interface (AutoFusionClassifier) that trains the full pipeline end-to-end with minimal configuration, and a flexible API for advanced users. Under the hood, LabelFusion integrates vector signals from both sources by concatenating the ML backbone's embeddings with the LLM-derived per-class scores -- obtained through structured prompt-engineering strategies -- and feeds this joint representation into a compact multi-layer perceptron (FusionMLP) that produces the final prediction. This learned fusion approach captures complementary strengths of LLM reasoning and traditional transformer-based classifiers, yielding robust performance across domains -- achieving 92.4% accuracy on AG News and 92.3% on 10-class Reuters 21578 topic classification -- while enabling practical trade-offs between accuracy, latency, and cost.
