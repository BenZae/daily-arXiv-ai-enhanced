A Structural Rebuttal to OpenAI's Hallucination Thesis", "comment": "17 pages, references to prior work arXiv:2509.16297 and arXiv:2511.06073", "summary": "OpenAI has recently argued that hallucinations in large language models result primarily from misaligned evaluation incentives that reward confident guessing rather than epistemic humility. On this view, hallucination is a contingent behavioral artifact, remediable through improved benchmarks and reward structures. In this paper, we challenge that interpretation. Drawing on previous work on structural hallucination and empirical experiments using a Licensing Oracle, we argue that hallucination is not an optimization failure but an architectural inevitability of the transformer model.\n  Transformers do not represent the world; they model statistical associations among tokens. Their embedding spaces form a pseudo-ontology derived from linguistic co-occurrence rather than world-referential structure. At ontological boundary conditions - regions where training data is sparse or incoherent - the model necessarily interpolates fictional continuations in order to preserve coherence. No incentive mechanism can modify this structural dependence on pattern completion.\n  Our empirical results demonstrate that hallucination can only be eliminated through external truth-validation and abstention modules, not through changes to incentives, prompting, or fine-tuning. The Licensing Oracle achieves perfect abstention precision across domains precisely because it supplies grounding that the transformer lacks.\n  We conclude that hallucination is a structural property of generative architectures and that reliable AI requires hybrid systems that distinguish linguistic fluency from epistemic responsibility.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5e7b\u89c9\u662fTransformer\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u5fc5\u7136\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4f18\u5316\u5931\u8d25\u3002\u9700\u901a\u8fc7\u5916\u90e8\u771f\u7406\u9a8c\u8bc1\u800c\u975e\u5185\u90e8\u6fc0\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u89e3\u51b3\u3002", "motivation": "\u6311\u6218\u5b66\u754c\u5c06\u5e7b\u89c9\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u7684\u4e3b\u6d41\u89c2\u70b9\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u6839\u672c\u6027\u8d28\u91cd\u65b0\u7406\u89e3\u5e7b\u89c9\u6210\u56e0", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u5e7b\u89c9\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bb8\u53ef\u9884\u8a00\u673a\uff08Licensing Oracle\uff09\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u6fc0\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u8c03\u6574\u65e0\u6cd5\u6291\u5236\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u4ec5\u5916\u90e8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u53ef\u6d88\u9664\u5e7b\u89c9\uff1bTransformer\u5728\u6570\u636e\u8fb9\u754c\u5916\u5fc5\u7136\u865a\u6784\u4fe1\u606f", "conclusion": "\u5efa\u8bae\u6784\u5efa\u533a\u5206\u8bed\u8a00\u6d41\u7545\u6027\u4e0e\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d23\u4efb\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4f4d\u751f\u6210\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u57fa\u7840"}}

We further propose two methods to improve the efficiency: tied word embedding that shares all embeddings across encoder and decoder, and merged attention that unifies decoder self- and cross-attention into a single joint module. Experiments demonstrate the generality of the adaptation strategy over architectures and modalities as well as the unique strength of the encoder-decoder architecture on long context modeling. Similar to T5Gemma, T5Gemma 2 yields comparable or better pretraining performance and significantly improved post-training performance than its Gemma 3 counterpart.

Understanding these dynamics is essential for assessing whether the media landscape offers a balanced and fair account of public debate. In earlier work, we introduced a pipeline that, given a news corpus, i) uses a hybrid human-machine approach to identify the range of viewpoints expressed about a given topic, and ii) classifies relevant claims with respect to the identified viewpoints, defined as sets of semantically and ideologically congruent claims (e.g., positions arguing that immigration positively impacts the UK economy). In this paper, we improve this pipeline by i) fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) for viewpoint classification and ii) enriching claim representations with semantic descriptions of relevant actors drawn from Wikidata. We evaluate our approach against alternative solutions on a benchmark centred on the UK immigration debate.

While sparse and linearized attention mechanisms attempt to mitigate this, they often compromise the representation of global dependencies or fail to capture multiscale semantic granularity effectively. In this paper, we propose Multiscale Aggregated Hierarchical Attention (MAHA), a novel architectural framework that reformulates the attention mechanism through hierarchical decomposition and mathematically rigorous aggregation. Unlike conventional approaches that treat token interactions at a single resolution, MAHA dynamically partitions the input sequence into hierarchical scales via learnable downsampling operators. The core innovation lies in its aggregation strategy: we model the fusion of scalespecific attention matrices as a resource allocation problem, solved via a convex optimization framework or a Nash equilibriumbased gametheoretic approach. This ensures a theoretically optimal balance between local nuance and global context fidelity. Implemented within a hybrid dilatedconvolutional transformer backbone, MAHA utilizes differentiable optimization layers to enable endtoend training. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that MAHA achieves superior scalability; empirical FLOPs analysis confirms an 81% reduction in computational cost at a sequence length of 4096 compared to standard attention.

To address this issue, we investigate the effectiveness of small VLM and propose SocialNav-MoE, an efficient Mixture-of-Experts vision language model for socially compliant navigation with reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT). We further introduce a semantic similarity reward (SSR) to effectively leverage RFT for enhancing the decision-making capabilities.

To address these challenges, we propose AquaDiff, a diffusion-based underwater image enhancement framework designed to correct chromatic distortions while preserving structural and perceptual fidelity. AquaDiff integrates a chromatic prior-guided color compensation strategy with a conditional diffusion process, where cross-attention dynamically fuses degraded inputs and noisy latent states at each denoising step. An enhanced denoising backbone with residual dense blocks and multi-resolution attention captures both global color context and local details. Furthermore, a novel cross-domain consistency loss jointly enforces pixel-level accuracy, perceptual similarity, structural integrity, and frequency-domain fidelity.

We find that many models struggle with modality fusion, where in some cases, removing the image even improves accuracy, indicating misalignment in vision-language integration. Chain-of-Thought prompting consistently enhances both accuracy and visual grounding, as demonstrated through ablation studies and occlusion-based interpretability. Our results reveal critical limitations in the scientific reasoning abilities of current MLLMs, providing actionable strategies for developing more robust and interpretable multimodal systems in chemistry.

We present HERBench, a VideoQA benchmark purpose-built to assess multi-evidence integration across time. Each question requires aggregating at least three non-overlapping evidential cues across distinct video segments, so neither language priors nor a single snapshot can suffice. HERBench comprises 26K five-way multiple-choice questions organized into twelve compositional tasks that probe identity binding, cross-entity relations, temporal ordering, co-occurrence verification, and counting. To make evidential demand measurable, we introduce the Minimum Required Frame-Set (MRFS), the smallest number of frames a model must fuse to answer correctly, and show that HERBench imposes substantially higher demand than prior datasets (mean MRFS 5.5 vs. 2.6-4.2). Evaluating 13 state-of-the-art Video-LLMs on HERBench reveals pervasive failures: accuracies of 31-42% are only slightly above the 20% random-guess baseline. We disentangle this failure into two critical bottlenecks: (1) a retrieval deficit, where frame selectors overlook key evidence, and (2) a fusion deficit, where models fail to integrate information even when all necessary evidence is provided.

Contemporary AI tools automate this for species with distinctive morphological features but remain largely image-based. Here, we extend Re-ID methodologies by incorporating precise dermatoglyphic textual descriptors-an approach used in forensics but new to ecology. We demonstrate that these specialist semantics abstract and encode animal coat topology using human-interpretable language tags. Drawing on 84,264 manually labelled minutiae across 3,355 images of 185 tigers (Panthera tigris), we evaluate this visual-textual methodology, revealing novel capabilities for cross-modal identity retrieval. To optimise performance, we developed a text-image co-synthesis pipeline to generate 'virtual individuals', each comprising dozens of life-like visuals paired with dermatoglyphic text. Benchmarking against real-world scenarios shows this augmentation significantly boosts AI accuracy in cross-modal retrieval while alleviating data scarcity. We conclude that dermatoglyphic language-guided biometrics can overcome vision-only limitations, enabling textual-to-visual identity recovery underpinned by human-verifiable matchings.

However, this voting strategy often induces confirmation bias and suffers from sparse rewards, limiting the overall performance. In this work, we propose subgroup-specific step-wise confidence-weighted pseudo-label estimation (SCOPE), a framework integrating model confidence and dynamic subgroup partitioning to address these issues. Specifically, SCOPE integrates the proposed step-wise confidence into pseudo label deduction, prioritizing high-quality reasoning paths over simple frequency count. Furthermore, it dynamically partitions the candidate outputs pool into independent subgroups by balancing reasoning quality against exploration diversity. By deriving local consensus via repeat sampling for each sub group, SCOPE provides diverse supervision targets to encourage broader exploration. We conduct experiments across various models and benchmarks, experimental results show that SCOPE consistently outperforms recent baselines.

However, these models may achieve high validation accuracy by learning specimen-specific artifacts rather than generalizable biological features, limiting real-world clinical utility. We introduce PANDA-PLUS-Bench, a curated benchmark dataset derived from expert-annotated prostate biopsies designed specifically to quantify this failure mode. The benchmark comprises nine carefully selected whole slide images from nine unique patients containing diverse Gleason patterns, with non-overlapping tissue patches extracted at both 512x512 and 224x224 pixel resolutions across eight augmentation conditions. Using this benchmark, we evaluate seven foundation models on their ability to separate biological signal from slide-level confounders. Our results reveal substantial variation in robustness across models: Virchow2 achieved the lowest slide-level encoding among large-scale models (81.0%) yet exhibited the second-lowest cross-slide accuracy (47.2%). HistoEncoder, trained specifically on prostate tissue, demonstrated the highest cross-slide accuracy (59.7%) and the strongest slide-level encoding (90.3%), suggesting tissue-specific training may enhance both biological feature capture and slide-specific signatures.

Using MCP-SafetyBench, we systematically evaluate leading open- and closed-source LLMs, revealing large disparities in safety performance and escalating vulnerabilities as task horizons and server interactions grow.

Despite aggressive treatment, the median survival rate is less than 15 months. Accurate multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) tumor segmentation is critical for surgical planning, radiotherapy, and disease monitoring. While deep learning models have improved the accuracy of automated segmentation, large-scale pre-trained models generalize poorly and often underperform, producing systematic errors such as false positives, label swaps, and slice discontinuities in slices. These limitations are further compounded by unequal access to GPU resources and the growing environmental cost of large-scale model training. In this work, we propose adaptive post-processing techniques to refine the quality of glioma segmentations produced by large-scale pretrained models developed for various types of tumors. We demonstrated the techniques in multiple BraTS 2025 segmentation challenge tasks, with the ranking metric improving by 14.9 % for the sub-Saharan Africa challenge and 0.9% for the adult glioma challenge.

While current state-of-the-art systems rely on closed data or compute-heavy models, TalkVerse offers 2.3 million high-resolution (720p/1080p) audio-video synchronized clips totaling 6.3k hours. These are curated from over 60k hours of video via a transparent pipeline that includes scene-cut detection, aesthetic assessment, strict audio-visual synchronization checks, and comprehensive annotations including 2D skeletons and structured visual/audio-style captions. Leveraging TalkVerse, we present a reproducible 5B DiT baseline built on Wan2.2-5B. By utilizing a video VAE with a high downsampling ratio and a sliding window mechanism with motion-frame context, our model achieves minute-long generation with low drift. It delivers comparable lip-sync and visual quality to the 14B Wan-S2V model but with 10$\\times$ lower inference cost. To enhance storytelling in long videos, we integrate an MLLM director to rewrite prompts based on audio and visual cues. Furthermore, our model supports zero-shot video dubbing via controlled latent noise injection. We open-source the dataset, training recipes, and 5B checkpoints to lower barriers for research in audio-driven human video generation.

While existing methods like KG-CoT improve reliability by integrating knowledge graph (KG) paths, they suffer from rigid hop-count selection (solely question-driven) and underutilization of reasoning paths (lack of guidance). To address this, we propose RFKG-CoT: First, it replaces the rigid hop-count selector with a relation-driven adaptive hop-count selector that dynamically adjusts reasoning steps by activating KG relations (e.g., 1-hop for direct \"brother\" relations, 2-hop for indirect \"father-son\" chains), formalized via a relation mask. Second, it introduces a few-shot in-context learning path guidance mechanism with CoT (think) that constructs examples in a \"question-paths-answer\" format to enhance LLMs' ability to understand reasoning paths. Experiments on four KGQA benchmarks show RFKG-CoT improves accuracy by up to 14.7 pp (Llama2-7B on WebQSP) over KG-CoT. Ablations confirm the hop-count selector and the path prompt are complementary, jointly transforming KG evidence into more faithful answers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faRFKG-CoT\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5173\u7cfb\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8df3\u8dc3\u6b21\u6570\u9009\u62e9\u5668\u548c\u8def\u5f84\u5f15\u5bfc\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u95ee\u7b54\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5KG-CoT\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u95ee\u7b54\u4e2d\u56e0\u56fa\u5b9a\u8df3\u8dc3\u6b21\u6570\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u8db3\u5bfc\u81f4\u6548\u679c\u53d7\u9650\u3002LLMs\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u4ecd\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "1.\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5173\u7cfb\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8df3\u8dc3\u9009\u62e9\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6fc0\u6d3b\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u5173\u7cfb\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u6b65\u9aa4\uff08\u5982\u7528\u5173\u7cfb\u63a9\u7801\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\uff09\u30022.\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8eCoT\u7684\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u8def\u5f84\u5f15\u5bfc\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u95ee\u9898-\u8def\u5f84-\u7b54\u6848\u683c\u5f0f\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u57284\u4e2aKGQA\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cRFKG-CoT\u4f7f\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe14.7\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff08Llama2-7B\u5728WebQSP\u4e0a\uff09\uff0c\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u8df3\u8dc3\u9009\u62e9\u5668\u548c\u8def\u5f84\u63d0\u793a\u4e92\u8865\uff0c\u53ef\u8054\u5408\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "RFKG-CoT\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8df3\u8dc3\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u663e\u6027\u8def\u5f84\u5f15\u5bfc\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u514b\u670dKG-CoT\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347LLMs\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

We present Puzzle Curriculum GRPO (PC-GRPO), a supervision-free recipe for RL with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) that strengthens visual reasoning in VLMs without annotations or external verifiers. PC-GRPO replaces labels with three self-supervised puzzle environments: PatchFit, Rotation (with binary rewards) and Jigsaw (with graded partial credit mitigating reward sparsity). To counter flat rewards and vanishing group-relative advantages, we introduce a difficulty-aware curriculum that dynamically weights samples and peaks at medium difficulty. We further monitor Reasoning-Answer Consistency (RAC) during post-training: mirroring reports for vanilla GRPO in LLMs, RAC typically rises early then degrades; our curriculum delays this decline, and consistency-enforcing reward schemes further boost RAC. RAC correlates with downstream accuracy. Across diverse benchmarks and on Qwen-7B and Qwen-3B backbones, PC-GRPO improves reasoning quality, training stability, and end-task accuracy, offering a practical path to scalable, verifiable, and interpretable RL post-training for VLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "PC-GRPO\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u6216\u5916\u90e8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u62fc\u56fe\u73af\u5883\u4e0e\u96be\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u8bfe\u7a0b\u52a8\u6001\u5e73\u8861\u6837\u672c\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u94fe\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "1. \u73b0\u6709RL\u65b9\u6cd5(\u5982GRPO)\u4f9d\u8d56\u6602\u8d35\u4e14\u6709\u566a\u97f3\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u6216\u5916\u90e8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\uff1b2.

In addition, we evaluate our model on the VoxCeleb1 dataset as a benchmark and reach 99.92% accuracy in Bimodal mode.

To address these issues, Machine Unlearning provides techniques to remove specific information from trained models without retraining from scratch. However, existing benchmarks for evaluating unlearning in LLMs face two major limitations: they focus only on English and support only entity-level forgetting (removing all information about a person). We introduce FAME (Fictional Actors for Multilingual Erasure), a synthetic benchmark for evaluating Machine Unlearning across five languages: English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish. FAME contains 1,000 fictional actor biographies and 20,000 question-answer pairs. Each biography includes information on 20 topics organized into structured categories (biography, career, achievements, personal information). This design enables both entity-level unlearning (i.e., forgetting entire identities) and instance-level unlearning (i.e., forgetting specific facts while retaining others). We provide two dataset splits to support these two different unlearning scenarios and enable systematic comparison of unlearning techniques across languages. Since FAME uses entirely fictional data, it ensures that the information was never encountered during model pretraining, allowing for a controlled evaluation of unlearning methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faFAME\uff08Fictional Actors for Multilingual Erasure\uff09\uff0c\u9996\u4e2a\u652f\u6301\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u82f1\u3001\u6cd5\u3001\u5fb7\u3001\u610f\u3001\u897f\u4e94\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u865a\u6784\u6f14\u5458\u7b80\u4ecb\u4e0e\u95ee\u7b54\u5bf9\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0b\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u6280\u672f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u6d4b\u8bc4\u57fa\u51c6\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u82f1\u6587\u548c\u5b9e\u4f53\u7ea7\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u652f\u6301\u548c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u9057\u5fd8\u8bc4\u4f30\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u9690\u79c1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u63a7\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u9057\u5fd8\u6548\u679c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u521b\u5efa\u5305\u542b1000\u4e2a\u865a\u6784\u6f14\u5458\u6863\u6848\u548c20000\u4e2a\u95ee\u7b54\u5bf9\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6FAME\uff0c\u6bcf\u4efd\u6863\u6848\u5305\u542b20\u4e2a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7c7b\u522b\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53cc\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5212\u5206\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u5b9e\u4f53\u7ea7\uff08\u5220\u9664\u6574\u4e2a\u8eab\u4efd\uff09\u548c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\uff08\u5220\u9664\u7279\u5b9a\u4e8b\u5b9e\uff09\u9057\u5fd8\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u865a\u6784\u6570\u636e\u786e\u4fdd\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u672a\u63a5\u89e6\u8fc7\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u4e8eFAME\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff1a\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\uff08\u5982Fine-Pruning,NegGrad,SCRUB\uff09\u5728\u5b8c\u5168\u8bb0\u5fc6\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4ec5\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u573a\u666f\u5b9e\u73b0\u5fae\u91cf\u9057\u5fd8\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u53c2\u6570\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u9057\u5fd8\u6548\u679c\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u65e0\u5173\uff0c\u9057\u5fd8\u6548\u679c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u8a00\u95f4\u5177\u6709\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u6280\u672f\u4ecd\u9700\u7a81\u7834\u6027\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u6d4b\u8bc4\u5bf9\u9690\u79c1\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4ef7\u503c\u3002\u865a\u6784\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53ef\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u5236\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u6307\u660e\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u5f00\u53d1\u8bed\u8a00\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6709\u6548\u9057\u5fd8\u673a\u5236\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

Camera-ready for WACV 2026", "summary": "Recent advances in generative AI have enabled the creation of highly realistic digital content, raising concerns around authenticity, ownership, and misuse. While watermarking has become an increasingly important mechanism to trace and protect digital media, most existing image watermarking schemes operate as black boxes, producing global detection scores without offering any insight into how or where the watermark is present. This lack of transparency impacts user trust and makes it difficult to interpret the impact of tampering. In this paper, we present a post-hoc image watermarking method that combines localised embedding with region-level interpretability. Our approach embeds watermark signals in the discrete wavelet transform domain using a statistical block-wise strategy. This allows us to generate detection maps that reveal which regions of an image are likely watermarked or altered.

We present a pose-based computational framework for interaction classification that moves beyond proximity heuristics by modeling the spatiotemporal geometry of anatomical keypoints. Rather than relying on pixel-level appearance or simple distance measures, the proposed method encodes interaction-specific motion signatures from keypoint trajectories, enabling differentiation of social interaction valence. The framework is implemented as an end-to-end computer vision pipeline integrating YOLOv11 for object detection (mAP@0.50: 96.24%), supervised individual identification (98.24% accuracy), ByteTrack for multi-object tracking (81.96% accuracy), ZebraPose for 27-point anatomical keypoint estimation, and a support vector machine classifier trained on pose-derived distance dynamics. On annotated interaction clips collected from a commercial dairy barn, the classifier achieved 77.51% accuracy in distinguishing affiliative and agonistic behaviors using pose information alone. Comparative evaluation against a proximity-only baseline shows substantial gains in behavioral discrimination, particularly for affiliative interactions.

This raises a fundamental question: what makes some questions more effective than others? To address this, a quantitative evaluation of question-generation models is essential. Video question generation (VQG) is a topic for video question answering (VideoQA), where questions are generated for given answers. Their evaluation typically focuses on the ability to answer questions, rather than the quality of generated questions. In contrast, we focus on the question quality in eliciting unseen knowledge from human experts. For a continuous improvement of VQG models, we propose a protocol that evaluates the ability by simulating question-answering communication with experts using a question-to-answer retrieval. We obtain the retriever by constructing a novel dataset, EgoExoAsk, which comprises 27,666 QA pairs generated from Ego-Exo4D's expert commentary annotation.

Current RLVR approaches typically conduct training across all generated tokens, but neglect to explore which tokens (e.g., prefix tokens) actually contribute to reasoning. This uniform training strategy spends substantial effort on optimizing low-return tokens, which in turn impedes the potential improvement from high-return tokens and reduces overall training effectiveness. To address this issue, we propose a novel RLVR approach called Progressive Prefix-token Policy Optimization (PPPO), which highlights the significance of the prefix segment of generated outputs. Specifically, inspired by the well-established human thinking theory of Path Dependence, where early-stage thoughts substantially constrain subsequent thinking trajectory, we identify an analogous phenomenon in LLM reasoning termed Beginning Lock-in Effect (BLE). PPPO leverages this finding by focusing its optimization objective on the prefix reasoning process of LLMs. This targeted optimization strategy can positively influence subsequent reasoning processes, and ultimately improve final results. To improve the learning effectiveness of LLMs on how to start reasoning with high quality, PPPO introduces two training strategies: (a) Progressive Prefix Retention, which shapes a progressive learning process by increasing the proportion of retained prefix tokens during training; (b) Continuation Accumulated Reward, which mitigates reward bias by sampling multiple continuations for one prefix token sequence, and accumulating their scores as the reward signal. Extensive experimental results on various reasoning tasks demonstrate that our proposed PPPO outperforms representative RLVR methods, with the accuracy improvements of 18.02% on only 26.17% training tokens.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aPPPO\u7684\u65b0\u578bRLVR\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u7126\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u751f\u6210\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u524d\u7f00\u6bb5\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f7f\u752826.17%\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3token\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b018.02%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dRLVR\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u751f\u6210token\u8fdb\u884c\u7edf\u4e00\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u524d\u7f00token\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8d44\u6e90\u6d6a\u8d39\u5728\u4f4e\u6536\u76catoken\u4e0a\u5e76\u963b\u788d\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u601d\u7ef4\u8def\u5f84\u4f9d\u8d56\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u524d\u7f00\u9501\u5b9a\u6548\u5e94\uff08BLE\uff09\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\uff1a1\uff09\u6e10\u8fdb\u524d\u7f00\u4fdd\u7559\uff08\u9010\u6b65\u589e\u52a0\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u4fdd\u7559\u7684\u524d\u7f00token\u6bd4\u4f8b\uff09\uff1b2\uff09\u8fde\u7eed\u7d2f\u79ef\u5956\u52b1\uff08\u5bf9\u591a\u4e2a\u7eed\u5199\u6837\u672c\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u6c42\u5e73\u5747\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u504f\u5dee\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cPPPO\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u4ee3\u8868\u6027RLVR\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u5728\u4ec5\u4f7f\u752826.17%\u8bad\u7ec3token\u65f6\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u534718.02%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u4f18\u5316LLM\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u524d\u7f00\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4e3a\u6539\u8fdb\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u524d\u7f00\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

This work addresses a fundamental question: what is the efficacy of different prompting strategies when applying LLMs to scientific information extraction? We focus on four key subtasks: event type classification (identifying synthesis steps), trigger text identification (locating event mentions), argument role extraction (recognizing parameter types), and argument text extraction (extracting parameter values). We evaluate four prompting strategies - zero-shot, few-shot, event-specific, and reflection-based - across six state-of-the-art LLMs (Gemma-3-12b-it, GPT-5-mini, O4-mini, Claude-Haiku-3.5, DeepSeek reasoning and non-reasoning) using the ZSEE dataset of 1,530 annotated sentences. Results demonstrate strong performance on event type classification (80-90\\% F1) but modest performance on fine-grained extraction tasks, particularly argument role and argument text extraction (50-65\\% F1). GPT-5-mini exhibits extreme prompt sensitivity with 11-79\\% F1 variation.

However, harsh lighting conditions and high equipment costs limit measurement methods based on traditional high-speed cameras. This paper proposes a method to measure high-frequency deformations by exploiting an event camera and LED markers. Firstly, observation noise is filtered based on the characteristics of the event stream generated by LED markers blinking and spatiotemporal correlation. Then, LED markers are extracted from the event stream after differentiating between motion-induced events and events from LED blinking, which enables the extraction of high-speed moving LED markers.

Manually written poems reach approximately 62% ASR, and automated versions 43%, with some models surpassing 90% success in single-turn interactions. The effect is structural: systems trained with RLHF, constitutional AI, and hybrid pipelines exhibit consistent degradation under minimal semiotic formal variation. Versification displaces the prompt into sparsely supervised latent regions, revealing guardrails that are excessively dependent on surface patterns.

Current methods often suffer from occlusions, garment style drift, and pose misalignment. We propose Pose-guided Multi-view Multimodal Diffusion (PMMD), a diffusion framework that synthesizes photorealistic person images conditioned on multi-view references, pose maps, and text prompts. A multimodal encoder jointly models visual views, pose features, and semantic descriptions, which reduces cross modal discrepancy and improves identity fidelity. We further design a ResCVA module to enhance local detail while preserving global structure, and a cross modal fusion module that integrates image semantics with text throughout the denoising pipeline. Experiments on the DeepFashion MultiModal dataset show that PMMD outperforms representative baselines in consistency, detail preservation, and controllability.

However, current approaches employ uniform language density for both intermediate reasoning and final answers, leading to computational inefficiency. Our observation found that reasoning process serves a computational function for the model itself, while answering serves a communicative function for human understanding. This distinction enables the use of compressed, symbol-rich language for intermediate computations while maintaining human-readable final explanations. To address this inefficiency, we present Denser: \\underline{D}ual-d\\underline{ens}ity inf\\underline{er}ence, a novel framework that optimizes information density separately for reasoning and answering phases. Our framework implements this through three components: a query processing module that analyzes input problems, a high-density compressed reasoning mechanism for efficient intermediate computations, and an answer generation component that translates compressed reasoning into human-readable solutions. Experimental evaluation across multiple reasoning question answering benchmarks demonstrates that Denser reduces token consumption by up to 62\\% compared to standard Chain-of-Thought methods while preserving or improving accuracy.

We conducted a comprehensive zero-shot evaluation across 14 distinct low-level tasks spanning 40 diverse datasets. By utilizing simple textual prompts without fine-tuning, we benchmarked Nano Banana Pro against state-of-the-art specialist models. Our extensive analysis reveals a distinct performance dichotomy: while \\textbf{Nano Banana Pro demonstrates superior subjective visual quality}, often hallucinating plausible high-frequency details that surpass specialist models, it lags behind in traditional reference-based quantitative metrics. We attribute this discrepancy to the inherent stochasticity of generative models, which struggle to maintain the strict pixel-level consistency required by conventional metrics.

Objective: This study aimed to explore a scalable alternative by developing and evaluating Large Language Models for Motivational Interviewing (MI-LLMs). Methods: We first curated five Chinese psychological counseling corpora and, using GPT-4 with an MI-informed prompt, transcribed multi-turn dialogues from the two highest-quality datasets (CPsyCounD and PsyDTCorpus) into 2,040 MI-style counseling conversations, of which 2,000 were used for training and 40 for testing. Three Chinese-capable open-source LLMs (Baichuan2-7B-Chat, ChatGLM-4-9B-Chat and Llama-3-8B-Chinese-Chat-v2) were fine-tuned on this corpus and were named as MI-LLMs. We evaluated MI-LLMs using round-based automatic metrics and expert manual coding with the Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity (MITI) Coding Manual 4.2.1. Results: Across all three models, fine-tuning substantially improved BLEU-4 and ROUGE scores compared with the base models, and manual coding showed that MI-LLMs achieved technical and relational global scores, and MI-adherent ratios that approached those of real MI dialogues, although complex reflections and reflection-to-question ratios remained less frequent.

However, long contexts pose significant challenges for inference efficiency, including high memory overhead from Key-Value (KV) cache and increased latency due to excessive memory accesses. Recent methods for dynamic KV selection struggle with trade-offs: block-level indexing degrades accuracy by retrieving irrelevant KV entries, while token-level indexing incurs high latency from inefficient retrieval mechanisms. In this paper, we propose CTKVR, a novel centroid-then-token KV retrieval scheme that addresses these limitations. CTKVR leverages a key observation: query vectors adjacent in position exhibit high similarity after Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) and share most of their top-k KV cache entries. Based on this insight, CTKVR employs a two-stage retrieval strategy: lightweight centroids are precomputed during prefilling for centroid-grained indexing, followed by token-level refinement for precise KV retrieval. This approach balances retrieval efficiency and accuracy. To further enhance performance, we implement an optimized system for indexing construction and search using CPU-GPU co-execution. Experimentally, CTKVR achieves superior performance across multiple benchmarks with less than 1% accuracy degradation.

However, current video understanding methods are mainly concerned with what and where the action is, which is unable to meet the requirements. Meanwhile, most of the existing datasets lack the labels indicating the degree of action standardization, and the action quality assessment datasets lack explainability and detailed feedback. Therefore, we define a new Human Action Form Assessment (AFA) task, and introduce a new diverse dataset CoT-AFA, which contains a large scale of fitness and martial arts videos with multi-level annotations for comprehensive video analysis. We enrich the CoT-AFA dataset with a novel Chain-of-Thought explanation paradigm. Instead of offering isolated feedback, our explanations provide a complete reasoning process--from identifying an action step to analyzing its outcome and proposing a concrete solution. Furthermore, we propose a framework named Explainable Fitness Assessor, which can not only judge an action but also explain why and provide a solution. This framework employs two parallel processing streams and a dynamic gating mechanism to fuse visual and semantic information, thereby boosting its analytical capabilities. The experimental results demonstrate that our method has achieved improvements in explanation generation (e.g., +16.0% in CIDEr), action classification (+2.7% in accuracy) and quality assessment (+2.1% in accuracy), revealing great potential of CoT-AFA for future studies.

Frameworks for \"thinking with images\" (e.g., ChatGPT-o3 and DeepEyes) show that stepwise multimodal reasoning can emerge by interleaving hypothesis formation with active acquisition of visual evidence, but they do not address three key challenges in spatial Chain-of-Thought (CoT): building global space perception under strict token budgets, explicitly associating 3D hypotheses with video frames for verification, and designing spatially grounded rewards for reinforcement learning. To address these issues, we present EagleVision, a dual-stage framework for progressive spatial cognition through macro perception and micro verification. In the macro perception stage, EagleVision employs a semantics-perspective-fusion determinantal point process (SPF-DPP) to select a compact set of geometry- and semantics-aware keyframes from long videos under a fixed token budget. In the micro verification stage, we formalize spatial CoT as BEV-grounded pose querying: the agent iteratively predicts poses on a BEV plane, retrieves the nearest real frames, and is trained purely by reinforcement learning with a spatial grounding reward that scores the consistency between predicted poses and observed views.

Many of the inherent difficulties in these tasks stem from Multi-word Expressions (MWEs), which complicate the tasks by introducing ambiguity, idiomatic expressions, infrequent usage, and a wide range of variations. Significant effort and substantial progress have been made in addressing the challenging nature of MWEs in Western languages, particularly English. This progress is attributed in part to the well-established research communities and the abundant availability of computational resources. However, the same level of progress is not true for language families such as Chinese and closely related Asian languages, which continue to lag behind in this regard. While sub-word modelling has been successfully applied to many Western languages to address rare words improving phrase comprehension, and enhancing machine translation (MT) through techniques like byte-pair encoding (BPE), it cannot be applied directly to ideograph language scripts like Chinese. In this work, we conduct a systematic study of the Chinese character decomposition technology in the context of MWE-aware neural machine translation (NMT).

This paper presents the first in-depth analysis of criticality metrics for safety evaluation of object detection systems. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature, we identify and assess a range of applicable metrics. Their effectiveness is empirically validated using the DeepAccident dataset, which features a variety of safety-critical scenarios. To enhance evaluation accuracy, we propose two novel application strategies: bidirectional criticality rating and multi-metric aggregation.

In contrast to prior research on byte-level LMs, which focuses predominantly on training from scratch, we train Bolmo by byteifying existing subword-level LMs. Byteification enables overcoming the limitations of subword tokenization - such as insufficient character understanding and efficiency constraints due to the fixed subword vocabulary - while performing at the level of leading subword-level LMs. Bolmo is specifically designed for byteification: our architecture resolves a mismatch between the expressivity of prior byte-level architectures and subword-level LMs, which makes it possible to employ an effective exact distillation objective between Bolmo and the source subword model. This allows for converting a subword-level LM to a byte-level LM by investing less than 1\\% of a typical pretraining token budget. Bolmo substantially outperforms all prior byte-level LMs of comparable size, and outperforms the source subword-level LMs on character understanding and, in some cases, coding, while coming close to matching the original LMs' performance on other tasks. Furthermore, we show that Bolmo can achieve inference speeds competitive with subword-level LMs by training with higher token compression ratios, and can be cheaply and effectively post-trained by leveraging the existing ecosystem around the source subword-level LM. Our results finally make byte-level LMs a practical choice competitive with subword-level LMs across a wide set of use cases.", "AI": {"tldr": "Bolmo\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5b50\u8bcd\u7ea7\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5b57\u8282\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\uff08byteification\uff09\uff0c\u57281B\u548c7B\u53c2\u6570\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u5b57\u8282\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4ec5\u97001%\u7684\u5e38\u89c4\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5b50\u8bcd\u5206\u8bcd\u5b58\u5728\u5b57\u7b26\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u56fa\u5b9a\u8bcd\u8868\u6548\u7387\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u5b57\u8282\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u4ece\u5934\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e14\u6548\u679c\u6b20\u4f73\uff0c\u9700\u63a2\u7d22\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u5b57\u8282\u7ea7\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u652f\u6301\u5b57\u8282\u5316\u7684\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u786e\u84b8\u998f\u76ee\u6807\u5c06\u5b50\u8bcd\u6a21\u578b\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\u81f3\u5b57\u8282\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u9ad8token\u538b\u7f29\u6bd4\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b50\u8bcd\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u884c\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "Bolmo\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u5b57\u8282\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u5b57\u7b26\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u6e90\u5b50\u8bcd\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5b50\u8bcd\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u4f4e\u4e14\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b57\u8282\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7Bolmo\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u521b\u65b0\u548c\u84b8\u998f\u7b56\u7565\u6210\u4e3a\u5b9e\u7528\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u8fbe\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5b50\u8bcd\u6a21\u578b\u6c34\u5e73\u3002"}}

Current deepfake detection methods are unreliable for two reasons: (i) distinguishing inauthentic content post-hoc is often impossible (e.g., with memorized samples), leading to an unbounded false positive rate (FPR); and (ii) detection lacks robustness, as adversaries can adapt to known detectors with near-perfect accuracy using minimal computational resources. To address these limitations, we propose a resynthesis framework to determine if a sample is authentic or if its authenticity can be plausibly denied. We make two key contributions focusing on the high-precision, low-recall setting against efficient (i.e., compute-restricted) adversaries. First, we demonstrate that our calibrated resynthesis method is the most reliable approach for verifying authentic samples while maintaining controllable, low FPRs. Second, we show that our method achieves adversarial robustness against efficient adversaries, whereas prior methods are easily evaded under identical compute budgets. Our approach supports multiple modalities and leverages state-of-the-art inversion techniques.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eresynthesis\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2a\u9020\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u68c0\u6d4b\u6280\u672f\u4e8b\u540e\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u548c\u6613\u88ab\u7ed5\u8fc7\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5bf9\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u573a\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2a\u9020\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u70b9\u81f4\u547d\u7f3a\u9677\uff1a(1)\u540e\u9a8c\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5e38\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\uff08\u5f15\u53d1\u65e0\u9650\u5047\u9633\u6027\u7387\uff09\uff1b(2)\u9632\u5fa1\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\uff08\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u80fd\u4ee5\u6781\u4f4e\u7b97\u529b\u7ed5\u8fc7\u68c0\u6d4b\uff09\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u53ef\u6eaf\u6e90\u7684resynthesis\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u7a81\u7834\u6b64\u7c7b\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u521b\u65b0\u6027\u5730\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u9636\u6bb5\u7b56\u7565\uff1a(1)\u901a\u8fc7\u6821\u51c6\u7684resynthesis\u8fc7\u7a0b\u91cd\u6784\u76ee\u6807\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u9006\u6027\u5efa\u7acb\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u6807\u51c6\uff1b(2)\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0b\u754c\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u963b\u65ad\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u5728\u6709\u9650\u7b97\u529b\u4e0b\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u9002\u914d\u3002\u6280\u672f\u5c42\u9762\u878d\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5904\u7406\u4e0e\u524d\u6cbf\u7684\u9006\u5411\u751f\u6210\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301<0.1%\u8d85\u4f4e\u5047\u9633\u6027\u7387\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u5bf9\u7b97\u529b\u53d7\u9650\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u8f83\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u534787%\u3002\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u4e8e\u7279\u5f81\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5176\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u57285\u79cd\u4e3b\u6d41\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5747\u4fdd\u6301>93%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u660e\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u7684resynthesis\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2a\u9020\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u591a\u5a92\u4f53\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u578b\u6280\u672f\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

The corpus contains 200 dialogues and 4709 utterances, including 2336 help seeker turns, with labeling and Cohen's kappa 0.639. In a counterbalanced study, the co-pilot reduced average annotation time by 22.4%. In expert review, it averaged 4.62 for evidence, 4.44 for clinical plausibility, and 4.40 for insight on a seven-point scale. Benchmarks with strong language models in zero-shot and fine-tuning settings demonstrate clear headroom, with the best macro F1-score around 30% and a tendency to overpredict mature defenses.

This raises the possibility of replacing human roles that bottleneck existing information flows, either due to insufficient staff or process complexity. However, LLMs make mistakes and some processing roles are safety critical. For example, triaging post-operative care to patients based on hospital referral letters, or updating site access schedules in nuclear facilities for work crews. If we want to introduce LLMs into critical information flows that were previously performed by humans, how can we make them safe and reliable? Rather than make performative claims about augmented generation frameworks or graph-based techniques, this paper argues that the safety argument should focus on the type of evidence we get from evaluation points in LLM processes, particularly in frameworks that employ LLM-as-Judges (LaJ) evaluators. This paper argues that although we cannot get deterministic evaluations from many natural language processing tasks, by adopting a basket of weighted metrics it may be possible to lower the risk of errors within an evaluation, use context sensitivity to define error severity and design confidence thresholds that trigger human review of critical LaJ judgments when concordance across evaluators is low.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec4\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u548c\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u5347LLMs\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5fc5\u8981\u65f6\u89e6\u53d1\u4eba\u5de5\u5e72\u9884\u3002", "motivation": "LLMs\u5728\u533b\u7597\u3001\u6838\u7535\u7ad9\u7b49\u5b89\u5168\u654f\u611f\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u66ff\u4ee3\u4eba\u529b\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u8bef\u5224\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u9700\u9488\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f53\u7cfb\uff08\u5982LLM-as-Judges\uff09\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u63d0\u51fa\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u591a\u7ef4\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u52a0\u6743\u6307\u6807\u7bee\u5b50\u964d\u4f4e\u5355\u4efb\u52a1\u5076\u7136\u8bef\u5dee\uff1b2\uff09\u5efa\u7acb\u9519\u8bef\u4e25\u91cd\u6027\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4f9d\u8d56\u6a21\u578b\uff1b3\uff09\u8bbe\u7f6e\u52a8\u6001\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u9608\u503c\u89e6\u53d1\u4eba\u5de5\u590d\u6838\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u6307\u6807\u5197\u4f59\u6027\u964d\u4f4e\u8bef\u5224\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5176\u9608\u503c\u89e6\u53d1\u673a\u5236\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u4ecb\u5165\u7684\u5173\u952e\u51b3\u7b56\u70b9\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u5b89\u5168\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u5728\u4e8e\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bc1\u636e\u94fe\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5316\u98ce\u9669\u7b49\u7ea7\u548c\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63a7\u5236\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9519\u8bef\u6982\u7387\u3002"}}

While existing methods achieve promising results in the camera coordinate system by assuming zero camera rotation, this simplification leads to significant errors when transforming the reconstructed mesh to the world coordinate system. To address this challenge, we propose Mesh-Plug, a plug-and-play module that accurately transforms human meshes from camera coordinates to world coordinates. Our key innovation lies in a human-centered approach that leverages both RGB images and depth maps rendered from the initial mesh to estimate camera rotation parameters, eliminating the dependency on environmental cues. Specifically, we first train a camera rotation prediction module that focuses on the human body's spatial configuration to estimate camera pitch angle. Then, by integrating the predicted camera parameters with the initial mesh, we design a mesh adjustment module that simultaneously refines the root joint orientation and body pose.

Recent work has proposed a simpler approach known as LatentQA: training LLMs to directly accept LLM activations as inputs and answer arbitrary questions about them in natural language. However, prior work has focused on narrow task settings for both training and evaluation. In this paper, we instead take a generalist perspective. We evaluate LatentQA-trained models, which we call Activation Oracles (AOs), in far out-of-distribution settings and examine how performance scales with training data diversity. We find that AOs can recover information fine-tuned into a model (e.g., biographical knowledge or malign propensities) that does not appear in the input text, despite never being trained with activations from a fine-tuned model. Our main evaluations are four downstream tasks where we can compare to prior white- and black-box techniques. We find that even narrowly-trained LatentQA models can generalize well, and that adding additional training datasets (such as classification tasks and a self-supervised context prediction task) yields consistent further improvements. Overall, our best AOs match or exceed prior white-box baselines on all four tasks and are the best method on 3 out of 4. These results suggest that diversified training to answer natural-language queries imparts a general capability to verbalize information about LLM activations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6837\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3LatentQA\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u79f0\u4f5cActivation Oracles\uff0cAOs\uff09\u6765\u89e3\u91ca\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6fc0\u6d3b\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u6a21\u578b\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u767d\u76d2\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u6fc0\u6d3b\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u590d\u6742\u4e14\u9002\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u800cLatentQA\u63d0\u4f9b\u76f4\u89c2\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u95ee\u7b54\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6837\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u9006\u5411\u5de5\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u77e5\u8bc6\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8bad\u7ec3Activation Oracles\uff08AOs\uff09\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u4efb\u52a1\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5LLM\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4e3a\u8f93\u5165\u5e76\u7528\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u56de\u7b54\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4e0e\u65e2\u6709\u767d\u76d2/\u9ed1\u76d2\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5bf9\u6548\u679c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "AOs\u53ef\u6062\u590d\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\uff08\u5373\u4f7f\u672a\u63a5\u89e6\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u591a\u6837\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u6700\u4f73AOs\u4e0e\u767d\u76d2\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c3\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u6837\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f7fLatentQA\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u5907\u4ece\u6fc0\u6d3b\u72b6\u6001\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u901a\u7528\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3aLLM\u89e3\u91ca\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002"}}

Such bias can lead to higher rates of inaccurate and missed diagnoses due to demographically skewed data and divergent distributions of diagnostic certainty. Current fairness interventions frequently fail to address these gaps or compromise overall diagnostic performance to achieve statistical parity among the subgroups. In this study, we developed Cross-Modal Alignment Consistency (CMAC-MMD), a training framework that standardises diagnostic certainty across intersectional patient subgroups. Unlike traditional debiasing methods, this approach equalises the model's decision confidence without requiring sensitive demographic data during clinical inference. We evaluated this approach using 10,015 skin lesion images (HAM10000) with external validation on 12,000 images (BCN20000), and 10,000 fundus images for glaucoma detection (Harvard-FairVLMed), stratifying performance by intersectional age, gender, and race attributes. In the dermatology cohort, the proposed method reduced the overall intersectional missed diagnosis gap (difference in True Positive Rate, $\u0394$TPR) from 0.50 to 0.26 while improving the overall Area Under the Curve (AUC) from 0.94 to 0.97 compared to standard training. Similarly, for glaucoma screening, the method reduced $\u0394$TPR from 0.41 to 0.31, achieving a better AUC of 0.72 (vs. 0.71 baseline). This establishes a scalable framework for developing high-stakes clinical decision support systems that are both accurate and can perform equitably across diverse patient subgroups, ensuring reliable performance without increasing privacy risks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6CMAC-MMD\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u51cf\u5c11\u533b\u7597\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u6027\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bca\u65ad\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u654f\u611f\u7684\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u533b\u7597AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u8bca\u65ad\u8fb9\u7f18\u5316\u60a3\u8005\u4e9a\u7fa4\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4e14\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\u5f80\u5f80\u672a\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u6216\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u6574\u4f53\u8bca\u65ad\u6027\u80fd\u4e3a\u4ee3\u4ef7\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86Cross-Modal Alignment Consistency\uff08CMAC-MMD\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6280\u672f\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u4e0d\u540c\u60a3\u8005\u4e9a\u7fa4\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u76ae\u80a4\u75c5\u53d8\u4e0e\u89c6\u7f51\u819c\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u76ae\u80a4\u79d1\u961f\u5217\u4e2d\uff0cCMAC-MMD\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u6574\u4f53\u4ea4\u53c9\u6027\u6f0f\u8bca\u7387\u5dee\u5f02\uff08\u0394TPR\u75310.50\u964d\u81f30.26\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347AUC\uff08\u75310.94\u5347\u81f30.97\uff09\uff1b\u5728\u9752\u5149\u773c\u7b5b\u67e5\u4e2d\uff0c\u0394TPR\u75310.41\u964d\u81f30.31\uff0cAUC\u75310.71\u5347\u81f30.72\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e2\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u53c8\u80fd\u786e\u4fdd\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u60a3\u8005\u4e9a\u7fa4\u4e2d\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002"}}

In this study, we therefore systematically compare the performance of state-of-the-art specialized counting architectures against VLMs on two popular counting datasets, as well as on a novel benchmark specifically created to have a finer-grained control over the visual properties of test images. Our findings show that most VLMs can approximately enumerate the number of items in a visual scene, matching or even surpassing the performance of specialized computer vision architectures. Notably, enumeration accuracy significantly improves when VLMs are prompted to generate intermediate representations (i.e., locations and verbal labels) of each object to be counted.

To achieve effective fusion, it is crucial to fully exploit the complementary information between the two modalities. Traditional CNN-based methods typically rely on channel-wise concatenation with fixed convolutional operators, which limits their adaptability to diverse spatial and spectral variations. While cross-attention mechanisms enable global interactions, they are computationally inefficient and may dilute fine-grained correspondences, making it difficult to capture complex semantic relationships. Recent advances in the Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (MMDiT) architecture have demonstrated impressive success in image generation and editing tasks.

We introduce AutoMAC-MRI, an explainable framework for grading motion artifacts across heterogeneous MR contrasts and orientations.

Within this feature space, we compute grade-specific affinity scores that quantify an image's proximity to each motion grade, thereby making grade assignments transparent and interpretable. We evaluate AutoMAC-MRI on more than 5000 expert-annotated brain MRI slices spanning multiple contrasts and views. Experiments assessing affinity scores against expert labels show that the scores align well with expert judgment, supporting their use as an interpretable measure of motion severity.

However, a major drawback of this scheme is its tendency to overly generalize, primarily due to the similarities between input and supervisory signals. In order to address this issue, this paper introduces a novel technique called masked reverse knowledge distillation (MRKD). By employing image-level masking (ILM) and feature-level masking (FLM), MRKD transforms the task of image reconstruction into image restoration. Specifically, ILM helps to capture global information by differentiating input signals from supervisory signals. On the other hand, FLM incorporates synthetic feature-level anomalies to ensure that the learned representations contain sufficient local information. With these two strategies, MRKD is endowed with stronger image context capture capacity and is less likely to be overgeneralized. Experiments on the widely-used MVTec anomaly detection dataset demonstrate that MRKD achieves impressive performance: image-level 98.9% AU-ROC, pixel-level 98.4% AU-ROC, and 95.3% AU-PRO.

Another important capability is to read measurements from instruments and apparatus. Here, we tried to mimic a human inspired approach to read measurements from a linear scale.

Modeling these bidirectional dynamics in 3D is essential for building expressive avatars and interactive robots. However, existing frameworks often treat talking and listening as independent processes or rely on non-causal full-sequence modeling, hindering temporal coherence across turns. We present TIMAR (Turn-level Interleaved Masked AutoRegression), a causal framework for 3D conversational head generation that models dialogue as interleaved audio-visual contexts.

In this work, we investigate the trade-off through empirical studies, yielding two key observations. First, we discover the reward clustering phenomenon in which many trajectories collapse toward the group-mean reward, offering limited optimization value. Second, we design a heuristic strategy named Optimal Variance Filtering (OVF), and verify that a high-variance subset of trajectories, selected by OVF can outperform the larger, unfiltered group. However, this static, post-sampling OVF approach still necessitates critical computational overhead, as it performs unnecessary sampling for trajectories that are ultimately discarded. To resolve this, we propose Pro-GRPO (Proactive GRPO), a novel dynamic framework that integrates latent feature-based trajectory pruning into the sampling process. Through the early termination of reward-clustered trajectories, Pro-GRPO reduces computational overhead. Leveraging its efficiency, Pro-GRPO employs an \"Expand-and-Prune\" strategy. This strategy first expands the size of initial sampling group to maximize trajectory diversity, then it applies multi-step OVF to the latents, avoiding prohibitive computational costs.

Despite significant advances in player and ball tracking, pose estimation, action localization, and automatic foul recognition, anticipating actions before they occur in sports videos has received comparatively little attention. This work introduces the task of action anticipation in basketball broadcast videos, focusing on predicting which team will gain possession of the ball following a shot attempt. To benchmark this task, a new self-curated dataset comprising 100,000 basketball video clips, over 300 hours of footage, and more than 2,000 manually annotated rebound events is presented. Comprehensive baseline results are reported using state-of-the-art action anticipation methods, representing the first application of deep learning techniques to basketball rebound prediction. Additionally, two complementary tasks, rebound classification and rebound spotting, are explored, demonstrating that this dataset supports a wide range of video understanding applications in basketball, for which no comparable datasets currently exist. Experimental results highlight both the feasibility and inherent challenges of anticipating rebounds, providing valuable insights into predictive modeling for dynamic multi-agent sports scenarios.

We investigate whether preserving marker independence, combined with deliberately shallow architectures, provides a more suitable inductive bias for self-supervised representation learning in multiplex data than increasing model scale. Using a Hodgkin lymphoma CODEX dataset with 145,000 cells and 49 markers, we compare standard early-fusion CNNs with channel-separated architectures, including a marker-aware baseline and our novel shallow Channel-Independent Model (CIM-S) with 5.5K parameters. After contrastive pretraining and linear evaluation, early-fusion models show limited ability to retain marker-specific information and struggle particularly with rare-cell discrimination. Channel-independent architectures, and CIM-S in particular, achieve substantially stronger representations despite their compact size. These findings are consistent across multiple self-supervised frameworks, remain stable across augmentation settings, and are reproducible across both the 49-marker and reduced 18-marker settings. These results show that lightweight, channel-independent architectures can match or surpass deep early-fusion CNNs and foundation models for multiplex representation learning.

We term this failure the 3D Mirage. This paper introduces the first end-to-end framework to probe, quantify, and tame this unquantified safety risk. To probe, we present 3D-Mirage, the first benchmark of real-world illusions (e.g., street art) with precise planar-region annotations and context-restricted crops. To quantify, we propose a Laplacian-based evaluation framework with two metrics: the Deviation Composite Score (DCS) for spurious non-planarity and the Confusion Composite Score (CCS) for contextual instability. To tame this failure, we introduce Grounded Self-Distillation, a parameter-efficient strategy that surgically enforces planarity on illusion ROIs while using a frozen teacher to preserve background knowledge, thus avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Our work provides the essential tools to diagnose and mitigate this phenomenon, urging a necessary shift in MDE evaluation from pixel-wise accuracy to structural and contextual robustness.

However, a fundamental challenge remains: how to efficiently acquire high-quality training data while maintaining annotation reliability? We introduce a self-evolving training pipeline powered by the Calibrated Step Reward System, which converts model-generated trajectories into reliable training signals through trajectory-level calibration, achieving >90% annotation accuracy with 10-100x lower cost. Leveraging this pipeline, we introduce Step-GUI, a family of models (4B/8B) that achieves state-of-the-art GUI performance (8B: 80.2% AndroidWorld, 48.5% OSWorld, 62.6% ScreenShot-Pro) while maintaining robust general capabilities. As GUI agent capabilities improve, practical deployment demands standardized interfaces across heterogeneous devices while protecting user privacy. To this end, we propose GUI-MCP, the first Model Context Protocol for GUI automation with hierarchical architecture that combines low-level atomic operations and high-level task delegation to local specialist models, enabling high-privacy execution where sensitive data stays on-device. Finally, to assess whether agents can handle authentic everyday usage, we introduce AndroidDaily, a benchmark grounded in real-world mobile usage patterns with 3146 static actions and 235 end-to-end tasks across high-frequency daily scenarios (8B: static 89.91%, end-to-end 52.50%).

However, this task is often challenged by environmental variability, visual similarities among species, and intra-class diversity. This study investigates the effectiveness of two individual deep learning architectures ResNet-101 and Inception v3 for wildlife object detection under such complex conditions. The models were trained and evaluated on a wildlife image dataset using a standardized preprocessing approach, which included resizing images to a maximum dimension of 800 pixels, converting them to RGB format, and transforming them into PyTorch tensors. A ratio of 70:30 training and validation split was used for model development. The ResNet-101 model achieved a classification accuracy of 94% and a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.91, showing strong performance in extracting deep hierarchical features.

Multi-view learning-based approaches mitigate these issues but often fail to generalize to real-world scenarios, as large-scale multi-view datasets with 3D ground truth are scarce and captured under constrained conditions. To overcome this limitation, recent methods rely on 2D pose estimation combined with 2D-to-3D pose lifting trained on synthetic data. Building on our previous MPL framework, we propose RUMPL, a transformer-based 3D pose lifter that introduces a 3D ray-based representation of 2D keypoints.

A new View Fusion Transformer leverages learned fused-ray tokens to aggregate information along rays, further improving multi-view consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RUMPL reduces MPJPE by up to 53% compared to triangulation and over 60% compared to transformer-based image-representation baselines.

In this paper, we perform an independent re-evaluation of these zero-shot claims using rigorous evaluation protocols while addressing potential sources of instrumentation bias. Our findings reveal a more nuanced picture: (1) deep learning methods perform comparably to iterative optimization on in-distribution T1w images and even on human-adjacent species (macaque), demonstrating improved task understanding; (2) however, performance degrades significantly on out-of-distribution contrasts (T2, T2*, FLAIR), with Cohen's d scores ranging from 0.7-1.5, indicating substantial practical impact on downstream clinical workflows; (3) deep learning methods face scalability limitations on high-resolution data, failing to run on 0.6 mm isotropic images, while iterative methods benefit from increased resolution; and (4) deep methods exhibit high sensitivity to preprocessing choices.

Recent approaches tend to adopt diffusion-based image/video generation models for realistic and expressive animation.

To address this, we propose DeX-Portrait, a novel approach capable of generating expressive portrait animation driven by disentangled pose and expression signals. Specifically, we represent the pose as an explicit global transformation and the expression as an implicit latent code. First, we design a powerful motion trainer to learn both pose and expression encoders for extracting precise and decomposed driving signals. Then we propose to inject the pose transformation into the diffusion model through a dual-branch conditioning mechanism, and the expression latent through cross attention.

Yu Zhou"], "title": "EmoCaliber: Advancing Reliable Visual Emotion Comprehension via Confidence Verbalization and Calibration", "comment": null, "summary": "Visual Emotion Comprehension (VEC) aims to infer sentiment polarities or emotion categories from affective cues embedded in images. In recent years, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have established a popular paradigm in VEC, leveraging their generalizability to unify VEC tasks defined under diverse emotion taxonomies. While this paradigm achieves notable success, it typically formulates VEC as a deterministic task, requiring the model to output a single, definitive emotion label for each image. Such a formulation insufficiently accounts for the inherent subjectivity of emotion perception, overlooking alternative interpretations that may be equally plausible to different viewers. To address this limitation, we propose equipping MLLMs with capabilities to verbalize their confidence in emotion predictions. This additional signal provides users with an estimate of both the plausibility of alternative interpretations and the MLLMs' self-assessed competence, thereby enhancing reliability in practice. Building on this insight, we introduce a three-stage training framework that progressively endows with structured reasoning, teaches to verbalize confidence, and calibrates confidence expression, culminating in EmoCaliber, a confidence-aware MLLM for VEC.

To fully exploit the potential of such models, a significant focus has been given to the collection of large amounts of training data that cover multiple remote sensing-specific tasks, such as image captioning or visual question answering. However, the cost of using and training LVLMs is high, due to the large number of parameters. While multiple parameter-efficient adaptation techniques have been explored, the computational costs of training and inference with these models can remain prohibitive for most institutions. In this work, we explore the use of encoder-only architectures and propose a model that can effectively address multi-task learning while remaining compact in terms of the number of parameters. In particular, our model tackles combinations of tasks that are not typically explored in a unified model: the generation of text from remote sensing images and cross-modal retrieval.

However, its development has been hindered by two major challenges: the lack of an efficient evaluation framework that reliably predicts downstream generation performance, and the difficulty of effectively adapting pretrained language models for visual synthesis. To address these issues, we introduce GRAN-TED, a paradigm to Generate Robust, Aligned, and Nuanced Text Embeddings for Diffusion models. Our contribution is twofold. First, we propose TED-6K, a novel text-only benchmark that enables efficient and robust assessment of an encoder's representational quality without requiring costly end-to-end model training. We demonstrate that performance on TED-6K, standardized via a lightweight, unified adapter, strongly correlates with an encoder's effectiveness in downstream generation tasks. Second, guided by this validated framework, we develop a superior text encoder using a novel two-stage training paradigm. This process involves an initial fine-tuning stage on a Multimodal Large Language Model for better visual representation, followed by a layer-wise weighting method to extract more nuanced and potent text features. Our experiments show that the resulting GRAN-TED encoder not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on TED-6K but also leads to demonstrable performance gains in text-to-image and text-to-video generation.

We evaluate SAM3 for RS imagery across four target types, comparing textual, geometric, and hybrid prompting strategies, under lightweight fine-tuning scales with increasing supervision, alongside zero-shot inference. Results show that combining semantic and geometric cues yields the highest performance across targets and metrics. Text-only prompting exhibits the lowest performance, with marked score gaps for irregularly shaped targets, reflecting limited semantic alignment between SAM3 textual representations and their overhead appearances. Nevertheless, textual prompting with light fine-tuning offers a practical performance-effort trade-off for geometrically regular and visually salient targets. Across targets, performance improves between zero-shot inference and fine-tuning, followed by diminishing returns as the supervision scale increases.

To overcome this limitation, we leverage CUT3R, a recent Reconstructive Foundation Model (RFM), to provide reliable geometric priors from a single RGB stream. We propose MoonSeg3R, which introduces three key components: (1) a self-supervised query refinement module with spatial-semantic distillation that transforms segmentation masks from 2D visual foundation models (VFMs) into discriminative 3D queries; (2) a 3D query index memory that provides temporal consistency by retrieving contextual queries; and (3) a state-distribution token from CUT3R that acts as a mask identity descriptor to strengthen cross-frame fusion.

However, existing distillation methods typically transfer modality-specific features directly to each sensor, which can distort their unique characteristics and degrade their individual strengths. To address this, we introduce IMKD, a radar-camera fusion framework based on multi-level knowledge distillation that preserves each sensor's intrinsic characteristics while amplifying their complementary strengths. IMKD applies a three-stage, intensity-aware distillation strategy to enrich the fused representation across the architecture: (1) LiDAR-to-Radar intensity-aware feature distillation to enhance radar representations with fine-grained structural cues, (2) LiDAR-to-Fused feature intensity-guided distillation to selectively highlight useful geometry and depth information at the fusion level, fostering complementarity between the modalities rather than forcing them to align, and (3) Camera-Radar intensity-guided fusion mechanism that facilitates effective feature alignment and calibration. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes benchmark show that IMKD reaches 67.0% NDS and 61.0% mAP, outperforming all prior distillation-based radar-camera fusion methods.

A core challenge lies in the limited availability of multi-view data and the tendency of monocular training to yield incomplete 3D head reconstructions. We identify the root cause of this issue as the entanglement between driving signal and target viewpoint when learning from monocular videos. To address this, we propose a transformer-based 3D portrait animation model with learnable data source tokens, so-called bias sinks, which enables unified training across monocular and multi-view datasets. This design leverages the strengths of both data sources during inference: strong generalization from monocular data and full 3D completeness from multi-view supervision. Furthermore, our training procedure yields a smooth latent avatar space that facilitates identity interpolation and flexible fitting to an arbitrary number of input observations. In extensive evaluations on single-view, few-shot, and monocular avatar creation tasks, we verify the efficacy of FlexAvatar. Many existing methods struggle with view extrapolation while FlexAvatar generates complete 3D head avatars with realistic facial animations.

In this paper, we introduce a robust method for pose estimation and calibration. We consider a set of rigid cameras, each observing the scene from a different perspective, which is a typical camera setup in animal behavior studies and forensic analysis of surveillance footage. Specifically, we analyse the individual components in a structure-from-motion (SfM) pipeline, and identify design choices that improve accuracy. Our main contributions are: (1) we investigate how to best subsample the predicted correspondences from a dense matcher to leverage them in the estimation process. (2) We investigate selection criteria for how to add the views incrementally.

Space-based sensing will enable inspection of RSOs at shorter ranges, independent of atmospheric effects, and from all aspects. The use of a sub-THz inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) imaging and sensing system for SDA has been proposed in previous work, demonstrating the achievement of sub-cm image resolution at ranges of up to 100 km. This work focuses on recognition of external structures by use of sequential feature detection and tracking throughout the aligned ISAR images of the satellites. The Hough transform is employed to detect linear features, which are tracked throughout the sequence. ISAR imagery is generated via a metaheuristic simulator capable of modelling encounters for a variety of deployment scenarios. Initial frame-to-frame alignment is achieved through a series of affine transformations to facilitate later association between image features. A gradient-by-ratio method is used for edge detection within individual ISAR images, and edge magnitude and direction are subsequently used to inform a double-weighted Hough transform to detect features with high accuracy. Feature evolution during sequences of frames is analysed. It is shown that the use of feature tracking within sequences with the proposed approach will increase confidence in feature detection and classification, and an example use-case of robust detection of shadowing as a feature is presented.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u5b50\u592a\u8d6b\u5179\u9006\u5408\u6210\u5b54\u5f84\u96f7\u8fbe\uff08ISAR\uff09\u56fe\u50cf\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u7a7a\u95f4\u57df\u611f\u77e5\uff08SDA\uff09\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7279\u5f81\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fd1\u5730\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e38\u9a7b\u7a7a\u95f4\u76ee\u6807\uff08RSOs\uff09\u6570\u91cf\u8fc5\u901f\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u9700\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684SDA\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u624b\u6bb5\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u8ddd\u79bb\u3001\u5927\u6c14\u6270\u52a8\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u7a7a\u95f4\u57fa\u4f20\u611f\u9700\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u7ed3\u6784\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eff\u5c04\u53d8\u6362\u8fdb\u884c\u56fe\u50cf\u5e8f\u5217\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u68af\u5ea6\u6bd4\u503c\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u8fb9\u7f18\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u6743\u91cd\u970d\u592b\u53d8\u6362\u8ffd\u8e2a\u7ebf\u6027\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u5143\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u751f\u6210ISAR\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u591a\u5e27\u7279\u5f81\u6f14\u53d8\u89c4\u5f8b\u3002", "result": "\u7279\u5f81\u8ddf\u8e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4e9a\u5398\u7c73\u7ea7\u5206\u8fa8\u7387ISAR\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u9634\u5f71\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u6790\u5bf9\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u7c7b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u6539\u5584\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u77ed\u8ddd\u7a7a\u95f4\u57faISAR\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u8bc6\u522b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u7a7a\u95f4\u76ee\u6807\u72b6\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

We introduce a new concept of 4D Occupancy Spatio-Temporal Persistence (OccSTeP), which aims to address two tasks: (1) reactive forecasting: ''what will happen next'' and (2) proactive forecasting: \"what would happen given a specific future action\". For the first time, we create a new OccSTeP benchmark with challenging scenarios (e.g., erroneous semantic labels and dropped frames). To address this task, we propose OccSTeP-WM, a tokenizer-free world model that maintains a dense voxel-based scene state and incrementally fuses spatio-temporal context over time. OccSTeP-WM leverages a linear-complexity attention backbone and a recurrent state-space module to capture long-range spatial dependencies while continually updating the scene memory with ego-motion compensation. This design enables online inference and robust performance even when historical sensor input is missing or noisy. Extensive experiments prove the effectiveness of the OccSTeP concept and our OccSTeP-WM, yielding an average semantic mIoU of 23.70% (+6.56% gain) and occupancy IoU of 35.89% (+9.26% gain).

Critically, the subjective nature of spatial rationality makes it challenging to quantify, hindering the use of traditional reward-based RLHF methods.

To resolve the gradient conflicts in standard DPO caused by identical foreground in win-lose pairs, we propose MaskDPO, which confines preference optimization exclusively to the background to enhance background spatial relationships, while retaining the inpainting loss in the foreground region for robust foreground preservation. To enhance coherence at the foreground-background boundary, we propose Conditional Asymmetric Preference Optimization, which samples pairs with differentiated cropping operations and applies global preference optimization to promote contextual awareness and enhance boundary coherence. Finally, based on the observation that winning samples share a commonality in plausible spatial relationships, we propose Shared Commonality Preference Optimization to enhance the model's understanding of spatial commonality across high-quality winning samples, further promoting shared spatial rationality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faInpaintDPO\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u524d\u666f\u9a71\u52a8\u56fe\u50cf\u4fee\u590d\u4e2d\u7684\u5c3a\u5ea6\u3001\u4f4d\u7f6e\u53ca\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0d\u534f\u8c03\u95ee\u9898", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4fee\u590d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u524d\u666f\u4e0e\u80cc\u666f\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u5173\u7cfb\u5408\u7406\u6027\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u4e3b\u89c2\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u4f20\u7edfRLHF\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u4f18\u5316\u7a7a\u95f4\u903b\u8f91\u4e00\u81f4\u6027", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86MaskDPO\uff08\u4e13\u6ce8\u80cc\u666f\u4f18\u5316\uff09\u3001\u6761\u4ef6\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\uff08\u591a\u88c1\u526a\u589e\u5f3a\u8fb9\u754c\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\uff09\u53ca\u5171\u4eab\u5171\u6027\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\uff08\u6316\u6398\u4f18\u8d28\u6837\u672c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5171\u6027\uff09\u4e09\u4f4d\u4e00\u4f53\u6846\u67b6", "result": "\u5728\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5408\u7406\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u4e0e\u8fb9\u754c\u8854\u63a5\uff0c\u76ee\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u80cc\u666f\u4e13\u5c5e\u4f18\u5316\u4e0e\u5171\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u5f3a\u5316\u7684\u521b\u65b0\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4e3a\u524d\u666f\u9a71\u52a8\u56fe\u50cf\u4fee\u590d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7a7a\u95f4\u7406\u6027\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f"}}

However, we observe that when only a limited number of crops per image are used, soft labels are prone to local semantic drift: a crop may visually resemble another class, causing its soft embedding to deviate from the ground-truth semantics of the original image. This mismatch between local visual content and global semantic meaning introduces systematic errors and distribution misalignment between training and testing. In this work, we revisit the overlooked role of hard labels and show that, when appropriately integrated, they provide a powerful content-agnostic anchor to calibrate semantic drift. We theoretically characterize the emergence of drift under few soft-label supervision and demonstrate that hybridizing soft and hard labels restores alignment between visual content and semantic supervision. Building on this insight, we propose a new training paradigm, Hard Label for Alleviating Local Semantic Drift (HALD), which leverages hard labels as intermediate corrective signals while retaining the fine-grained advantages of soft labels. Extensive experiments on dataset distillation and large-scale conventional classification benchmarks validate our approach, showing consistent improvements in generalization. On ImageNet-1K, we achieve 42.7% with only 285M storage for soft labels, outperforming prior state-of-the-art LPLD by 9.0%.

While recent works address this via post-training, they typically rely on a bidirectional teacher model or online discriminator. To achieve an end-to-end solution, we introduce Resampling Forcing, a teacher-free framework that enables training autoregressive video models from scratch and at scale. Central to our approach is a self-resampling scheme that simulates inference-time model errors on history frames during training. Conditioned on these degraded histories, a sparse causal mask enforces temporal causality while enabling parallel training with frame-level diffusion loss. To facilitate efficient long-horizon generation, we further introduce history routing, a parameter-free mechanism that dynamically retrieves the top-k most relevant history frames for each query.

Most state-of-the-art approaches rely on late fusion to combine visual and audio features, but late fusion often fails to capture fine-grained cross-modal interactions, which can be critical for robust performance in unconstrained scenarios. In this paper, we introduce GateFusion, a novel architecture that combines strong pretrained unimodal encoders with a Hierarchical Gated Fusion Decoder (HiGate). HiGate enables progressive, multi-depth fusion by adaptively injecting contextual features from one modality into the other at multiple layers of the Transformer backbone, guided by learnable, bimodally-conditioned gates. To further strengthen multimodal learning, we propose two auxiliary objectives: Masked Alignment Loss (MAL) to align unimodal outputs with multimodal predictions, and Over-Positive Penalty (OPP) to suppress spurious video-only activations. GateFusion establishes new state-of-the-art results on several challenging ASD benchmarks, achieving 77.8% mAP (+9.4%), 86.1% mAP (+2.9%), and 96.1% mAP (+0.5%) on Ego4D-ASD, UniTalk, and WASD benchmarks, respectively, and delivering competitive performance on AVA-ActiveSpeaker.

They take as input a single RGB image and output a deep feature representation that is useful for various applications. However, in case we have multiple views of the same 3D scene, they operate on each image independently and do not always produce consistent features for the same 3D point. We propose a way to convert a Foundation Model into a Multi-View Foundation Model. Such a model takes as input a set of images and outputs a feature map for each image such that the features of corresponding points are as consistent as possible. This approach bypasses the need to build a consistent 3D model of the features and allows direct manipulation in the image space. Specifically, we show how to augment Transformers-based foundation models (i.e., DINO, SAM, CLIP) with intermediate 3D-aware attention layers that help match features across different views. As leading examples, we show surface normal estimation and multi-view segmentation tasks. Quantitative experiments show that our method improves feature matching considerably compared to current foundation models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u6dfb\u52a03D\u611f\u77e5\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5c42\uff0c\u5c06\u5355\u89c6\u56fe\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u6269\u5c55\u4e3a\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u7248\u672c\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u89c6\u89d2\u7279\u5f81\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u65f6\u7f3a\u4e4f3D\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u5339\u914d\u540c\u4e003D\u70b9\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u89c6\u89d2\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u9700\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5728Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u7684CLIP\u3001SAM\u7b49\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u63d2\u5165\u4e2d\u95f43D\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5c42\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u50cf\u7a7a\u95f4\u9690\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u8de8\u89c6\u89d2\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u6784\u5efa3D\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8868\u9762\u6cd5\u7ebf\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u8f83\u4f20\u7edf2D\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u5f81\u5339\u914d\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e37%\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u97003D\u91cd\u5efa\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u89c6\u56fe\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u6269\u5c55\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u9690\u5f0f3D\u611f\u77e5\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u8de8\u89c6\u89d2\u7279\u5f81\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u7ef4\u611f\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

However, due to the capability limitations of the base diffusion language model, the performance of the diffusion vision language model (dVLM) still lags significantly behind that of mainstream models. This leads to a simple yet fundamental question: Is it possible to construct dVLMs based on existing powerful AR models? In response, we propose DiffusionVL, a dVLM family that could be translated from any powerful AR models. Through simple fine-tuning, we successfully adapt AR pre-trained models into the diffusion paradigm. This approach yields two key observations: (1) The paradigm shift from AR-based multimodal models to diffusion is remarkably effective. (2) Direct conversion of an AR language model to a dVLM is also feasible, achieving performance competitive with LLaVA-style visual-instruction-tuning. Further, we introduce a block-decoding design into dVLMs that supports arbitrary-length generation and KV cache reuse, achieving a significant inference speedup. We conduct a large number of experiments. Despite training with less than 5% of the data required by prior methods, DiffusionVL achieves a comprehensive performance improvement-a 34.4% gain on the MMMU-Pro (vision) bench and 37.5% gain on the MME (Cog.) bench-alongside a 2x inference speedup.
