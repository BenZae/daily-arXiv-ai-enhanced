Motivation: 针对现有评估指标在孟加拉语（低资源语言）中缺乏适用性且依赖参考摘要的问题，解决医疗、教育等高风险领域摘要可靠性评估需求。

Method: 使用多语言指令调优模型完成自动问答生成与答案对比，通过问题生成、答案提取和重要性加权进行事实准确性和内容覆盖率评估，并利用BERTScore-Recall增强语义一致性判断。

Result: 在300个人工撰写的教育/医疗领域摘要中验证，评估结果与专家判断呈现强相关性（Pearson r=0.694，Spearman ρ=0.763）。

Conclusion: BanglaSummEval通过可解释的步骤和跨语言能力，为低资源语言提供了高效透明的事实一致性评估方案。

Abstract: Evaluating factual consistency is essential for reliable text summarization, particularly in high-stakes domains such as healthcare and news. However, most existing evaluation metrics overlook Bangla, a widely spoken yet under-resourced language, and often depend on reference summaries. We introduce BanglaSummEval, a reference-free, question-answering-based framework for evaluating factual consistency in Bangla summarization. The proposed method assesses both factual accuracy and content coverage through automatically generated questions and answers derived from the source document and the summary. A single multilingual instruction-tuned language model handles question generation, question answering, candidate answer extraction, and question importance weighting. This unified design reduces system complexity and computational cost. To capture semantic consistency beyond surface-level overlap, we use BERTScore-Recall for answer comparison. We validate BanglaSummEval on 300 human-written summaries from educational and medical domains, demonstrating strong correlation with expert human judgments (Pearson's $r = 0.694$, Spearman's $ρ= 0.763$). By providing interpretable, step-wise diagnostics alongside reliable evaluation scores, BanglaSummEval offers a practical and transparent solution for factual consistency evaluation in low-resource language settings.
