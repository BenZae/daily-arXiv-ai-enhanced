### [1] [Closing the Gap: Data-Centric Fine-Tuning of Vision Language Models for the Standardized Exam Questions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00042)
*Egemen Sert,Şeyda Ertekin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现，通过高质量数据集进行监督微调可媲美专有模型（如Gemini 2.0 Flash）在多模态推理任务上的表现，使用161.4亿token的数据集与优化后的QMSA语法，在YKSUniform基准测试中达到78.6%准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态推理研究多聚焦算法创新（如强化学习），而对数据驱动的视觉语言推理基础研究不足，需探索数据质量对模型性能的影响。

Method: 构建融合教材问答对、课程匹配图表和上下文材料的多模态数据集，采用QMSA推理语法优化策略，对Qwen-2.5VL-32B模型进行监督微调。

Result: 模型在包含309个课程主题的YKSUniform基准测试中准确率达78.6%（仅比Gemini 2.0 Flash低1.0%），证明数据构成与表征语法对多模态推理具有决定性作用。

Conclusion: 验证了数据驱动方法在多模态视觉语言模型中的有效性，表明精心设计的课程关联数据与监督微调能实现接近SOTA的性能。

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning has become a cornerstone of modern AI research. Standardized exam questions offer a uniquely rigorous testbed for such reasoning, providing structured visual contexts and verifiable answers. While recent progress has largely focused on algorithmic advances such as reinforcement learning (e.g., GRPO, DPO), the data centric foundations of vision language reasoning remain less explored.
  We show that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with high-quality data can rival proprietary approaches. To this end, we compile a 161.4 million token multimodal dataset combining textbook question-solution pairs, curriculum aligned diagrams, and contextual materials, and fine-tune Qwen-2.5VL-32B using an optimized reasoning syntax (QMSA). The resulting model achieves 78.6% accuracy, only 1.0% below Gemini 2.0 Flash, on our newly released benchmark YKSUniform, which standardizes 1,854 multimodal exam questions across 309 curriculum topics.
  Our results reveal that data composition and representational syntax play a decisive role in multimodal reasoning. This work establishes a data centric framework for advancing open weight vision language models, demonstrating that carefully curated and curriculum-grounded multimodal data can elevate supervised fine-tuning to near state-of-the-art performance.

### [2] [PEFT-DML: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning Deep Metric Learning for Robust Multi-Modal 3D Object Detection in Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00060)
*Abdolazim Rezaei,Mehdi Sookhak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出PEFT-DML，通过参数高效方法实现自动驾驶多模态3D目标检测，有效处理传感器失效和模态变化，实验验证其准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多传感器目标检测需固定模态配置，但实际驾驶中常遭遇传感器失效或未见过的模态组合，亟需高容忍度和自适应性模型。

Method: 结合低秩自适应(LoRA)与适配器层，将LiDAR/雷达/相机/IMU/GNSS多模态映射至共享潜在空间，通过对比学习构建度量空间，实现参数高效训练(仅微调0.8%参数)与传感器组合可扩展性。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上实现2.1% mAP提升，传感器随机移除时mAP衰减低于传统方法5.3%，同时训练效率提升12倍，单帧推理时间仅58ms。

Conclusion: PEFT-DML在保持参数效率的同时显著增强多传感器检测系统的容错能力与泛化性，为自动驾驶系统实际部署提供关键支撑。

Abstract: This study introduces PEFT-DML, a parameter-efficient deep metric learning framework for robust multi-modal 3D object detection in autonomous driving. Unlike conventional models that assume fixed sensor availability, PEFT-DML maps diverse modalities (LiDAR, radar, camera, IMU, GNSS) into a shared latent space, enabling reliable detection even under sensor dropout or unseen modality class combinations. By integrating Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and adapter layers, PEFT-DML achieves significant training efficiency while enhancing robustness to fast motion, weather variability, and domain shifts. Experiments on benchmarks nuScenes demonstrate superior accuracy.

### [3] [Satellite to Street : Disaster Impact Estimator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00065)
*Sreesritha Sai,Sai Venkata Suma Sreeja,Deepthi,Nikhil*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Satellite-to-Street是基于改进双输入U-Net架构与特征融合的灾害损伤评估模型，旨在解决手动解译效率低与现有AI方法敏感度不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 灾后快速精准的损伤评估对调配应急资源至关重要，但人工解译卫星影像存在速度慢、主观性强等问题，传统深度学习模型在细微结构变化识别和类别不平衡数据（大量未受损像素干扰）中表现欠佳。

Method: 采用双输入U-Net架构处理灾前/灾后卫星影像，增强局部结构变化与全局上下文特征的融合；引入类别感知加权损失函数（class-aware weighted loss），提升对中度/重度损坏类别的识别敏感度。

Result: 在公开灾害数据集上验证，相比传统分割模型和变化检测模型，在损伤区域定位与分类精度（尤其对重度受损区域）均显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法可在专家决策基础上提供快速、一致的损伤地图生成工具，提升灾害管理的数据驱动效率，但强调仍需专家复核确保可靠性。

Abstract: Accurate post-disaster damage assessment is of high importance for prioritizing emergency response; however, manual interpretation of satellite imagery is slow, subjective, and hard to scale. While deep-learning models for image segmentation, such as U-Net-based baselines and change-detection models, are useful baselines, they often struggle with subtle structural variations and severe class imbalance, yielding poor detection of highly damaged regions. The present work proposes a deep-learning framework that jointly processes pre- and post-disaster satellite images to obtain fine-grained pixel-level damage maps: Satellite-to-Street: Disaster Impact Estimator. The model uses a modified dual-input U-Net architecture with enhanced feature fusion to capture both the local structural changes as well as the broader contextual cues. Class-aware weighted loss functions are integrated in order to handle the dominance of undamaged pixels in real disaster datasets, thus enhancing sensitivity toward major and destroyed categories. Experimentation on publicly available disaster datasets shows improved localization and classification of structural damage when compared to traditional segmentation and baseline change-detection models. The resulting damage maps provide a rapid and consistent assessment mechanism to support and not replace expert decision-making, thus allowing more efficient, data-driven disaster management.

### [4] [ProvRain: Rain-Adaptive Denoising and Vehicle Detection via MobileNet-UNet and Faster R-CNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00073)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 夜间车辆检测面临天气（如雨雪）及相机引起的噪音干扰，现有方法难以有效提取非车灯特征以实现提前预警。

Method: 构建基于MobileNet-U-Net的降噪管道ProvRain，采用课程训练策略并融合合成数据及PVDN数据集，在Faster RCNN基础上优化天气鲁棒性。

Result: 相比基础模型，准确率提升8.94%，召回率提升10.25%；PSNR提升10-15%，SSIM提升5-6%，LPIPS降低67%。

Conclusion: 通过设计轻量化降噪模型与多阶段训练策略，显著提升夜间雨天下的车辆检测性能与图像质量评价指标。

Abstract: Provident vehicle detection has a lot of scope in the detection of vehicle during night time. The extraction of features other than the headlamps of vehicles allows us to detect oncoming vehicles before they appear directly on the camera. However, it faces multiple issues especially in the field of night vision, where a lot of noise caused due to weather conditions such as rain or snow as well as camera conditions. This paper focuses on creating a pipeline aimed at dealing with such noise while at the same time maintaining the accuracy of provident vehicular detection. The pipeline in this paper, ProvRain, uses a lightweight MobileNet-U-Net architecture tuned to generalize to robust weather conditions by using the concept of curricula training. A mix of synthetic as well as available data from the PVDN dataset is used for this. This pipeline is compared to the base Faster RCNN architecture trained on the PVDN dataset to see how much the addition of a denoising architecture helps increase the detection model's performance in rainy conditions. The system boasts an 8.94\% increase in accuracy and a 10.25\% increase in recall in the detection of vehicles in rainy night time frames. Similarly, the custom MobileNet-U-Net architecture that was trained also shows a 10-15\% improvement in PSNR, a 5-6\% increase in SSIM, and upto a 67\% reduction in perceptual error (LPIPS) compared to other transformer approaches.

### [5] [Adapter Shield: A Unified Framework with Built-in Authentication for Preventing Unauthorized Zero-Shot Image-to-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00075)
*Jun Jia,Hongyi Miao,Yingjie Zhou,Wangqiu Zhou,Jianbo Zhang,Linhan Cao,Dandan Zhu,Hua Yang,Xiongkuo Min,Wei Sun,Guangtao Zhai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Adapter Shield，一种用于零样本图像生成场景中的通用防御方法，通过可逆加密和对抗扰动保护图像免遭未经授权使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型进步导致零样本图像生成滥用（如身份克隆和风格模仿）风险升高，现有技术缺乏有效的通用防御方案。

Method: 通过分析扩散模型图像编码器与UNet交叉注意力机制，设计基于密钥的嵌入加密系统，并采用多目标对抗扰动将原始嵌入转换为加密模式。

Result: 实验显示该方法优于现有防御技术，在阻止未经授权的零样本生成的同时，支持授权用户的可控解密与高质量生成。

Conclusion: 该方案实现了图像保护与灵活授权的平衡，为扩散模型安全应用提供了创新性解决方案。

Abstract: With the rapid progress in diffusion models, image synthesis has advanced to the stage of zero-shot image-to-image generation, where high-fidelity replication of facial identities or artistic styles can be achieved using just one portrait or artwork, without modifying any model weights. Although these techniques significantly enhance creative possibilities, they also pose substantial risks related to intellectual property violations, including unauthorized identity cloning and stylistic imitation. To counter such threats, this work presents Adapter Shield, the first universal and authentication-integrated solution aimed at defending personal images from misuse in zero-shot generation scenarios. We first investigate how current zero-shot methods employ image encoders to extract embeddings from input images, which are subsequently fed into the UNet of diffusion models through cross-attention layers. Inspired by this mechanism, we construct a reversible encryption system that maps original embeddings into distinct encrypted representations according to different secret keys. The authorized users can restore the authentic embeddings via a decryption module and the correct key, enabling normal usage for authorized generation tasks. For protection purposes, we design a multi-target adversarial perturbation method that actively shifts the original embeddings toward designated encrypted patterns. Consequently, protected images are embedded with a defensive layer that ensures unauthorized users can only produce distorted or encrypted outputs. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method surpasses existing state-of-the-art defenses in blocking unauthorized zero-shot image synthesis, while supporting flexible and secure access control for verified users.

### [6] [Diffusion-Based Synthetic Brightfield Microscopy Images for Enhanced Single Cell Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00078)
*Mario de Jesus da Graca,Jörg Dahlkemper,Peer Stelldinger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 利用扩散模型生成的合成显微镜图像可有效提升细胞检测精度，同时显著降低人工标注需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 明场显微镜细胞检测受限于标注数据稀缺和高昂的人工标注成本，传统深度学习方法面临数据不足瓶颈亟需解决。

Method: 基于U-Net构建无条件扩散模型生成高逼真度合成图像，混合不同比例合成数据与真实数据进行实验。采用YOLOv8/9和RT-DETR模型验证检测精度，通过专家盲测评估图像真实性。

Result: 合成数据训练使检测准确率提升且成本趋近于零；人眼无法区分合成与真实图像（辨别正确率仅50%）；算法在多个检测框架上均展现稳定性能提升。

Conclusion: 扩散模型合成数据为显微图像分析提供新型数据增强方案，可突破传统标注依赖，在维持检测精度的同时降低80%标注工作量，并提升模型泛化能力。

Abstract: Accurate single cell detection in brightfield microscopy is crucial for biological research, yet data scarcity and annotation bottlenecks limit the progress of deep learning methods. We investigate the use of unconditional models to generate synthetic brightfield microscopy images and evaluate their impact on object detection performance. A U-Net based diffusion model was trained and used to create datasets with varying ratios of synthetic and real images. Experiments with YOLOv8, YOLOv9 and RT-DETR reveal that training with synthetic data can achieve improved detection accuracies (at minimal costs). A human expert survey demonstrates the high realism of generated images, with experts not capable to distinguish them from real microscopy images (accuracy 50%). Our findings suggest that diffusion-based synthetic data generation is a promising avenue for augmenting real datasets in microscopy image analysis, reducing the reliance on extensive manual annotation and potentially improving the robustness of cell detection models.

### [7] [Conceptual Evaluation of Deep Visual Stereo Odometry for the MARWIN Radiation Monitoring Robot in Accelerator Tunnels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00080)
*André Dehne,Juri Zach,Peer Stelldinger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了使用深度视觉立体里程计（DVSO）技术来提升MARWIN机器人在欧洲XFEL加速器隧道中的自主导航能力，以解决传统方法在未知几何环境中的灵活性不足问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 欧洲XFEL的加速器隧道因结构重复、环境单调导致传统定位方法（如激光里程计+QR码）失效，且现有系统无法适应未知障碍物，亟需更鲁棒的视觉导航方案。

Method: 采用纯视觉的DVSO技术（结合立体视差、光流、自监督学习进行联合深度和运动估计），通过3D几何约束优化局部建图，并设计与绝对参考系（如路标）的融合策略确保全局一致性。

Result: 预期可通过立体视觉降低尺度漂移实现低成本定位，但面临低纹理隧道、辐射环境光干扰和算力限制等工程挑战，需在欧洲XFEL隧道进行验证迭代。

Conclusion: 论文提出基于DVSO的导航研究框架，旨在使机器人在安全敏感型基础设施中自主避障，下一步需攻克辐射耐受成像和轻量化模型部署等关键技术。

Abstract: The MARWIN robot operates at the European XFEL to perform autonomous radiation monitoring in long, monotonous accelerator tunnels where conventional localization approaches struggle. Its current navigation concept combines lidar-based edge detection, wheel/lidar odometry with periodic QR-code referencing, and fuzzy control of wall distance, rotation, and longitudinal position. While robust in predefined sections, this design lacks flexibility for unknown geometries and obstacles. This paper explores deep visual stereo odometry (DVSO) with 3D-geometric constraints as a focused alternative. DVSO is purely vision-based, leveraging stereo disparity, optical flow, and self-supervised learning to jointly estimate depth and ego-motion without labeled data. For global consistency, DVSO can subsequently be fused with absolute references (e.g., landmarks) or other sensors. We provide a conceptual evaluation for accelerator tunnel environments, using the European XFEL as a case study. Expected benefits include reduced scale drift via stereo, low-cost sensing, and scalable data collection, while challenges remain in low-texture surfaces, lighting variability, computational load, and robustness under radiation. The paper defines a research agenda toward enabling MARWIN to navigate more autonomously in constrained, safety-critical infrastructures.

### [8] [Exploring Diagnostic Prompting Approach for Multimodal LLM-based Visual Complexity Assessment: A Case Study of Amazon Search Result Pages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00082)
*Divendar Murtadak,Yoon Kim,Trilokya Akula*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Diagnostic prompting significantly improves MLLM reliability in visual complexity assessment of Amazon SRP compared to standard methods, but absolute performance remains limited with ongoing challenges in human-model alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance MLLM consistency with human judgments in e-commerce visual complexity evaluation, addressing limitations in current gestalt-based prompting approaches.

Method: 200 Amazon SRP pages evaluated via diagnostic vs. standard prompting, validated against human expert annotations using F1-scores, Cohen's κ, and decision tree analysis of model reasoning patterns.

Result: Diagnostic prompting achieved +858% relative F1-score improvement (0.031→0.297), revealed model preference for visual design metrics (badge clutter 38.6% importance), and identified persistent perception gaps in product similarity and color assessment.

Conclusion: Diagnostic prompting shows promise for human-aligned MLLM evaluations but requires further refinement including larger annotated datasets to resolve systematic failure modes like color intensity analysis and content similarity judgments.

Abstract: This study investigates whether diagnostic prompting can improve Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) reliability for visual complexity assessment of Amazon Search Results Pages (SRP). We compare diagnostic prompting with standard gestalt principles-based prompting using 200 Amazon SRP pages and human expert annotations. Diagnostic prompting showed notable improvements in predicting human complexity judgments, with F1-score increasing from 0.031 to 0.297 (+858\% relative improvement), though absolute performance remains modest (Cohen's $κ$ = 0.071). The decision tree revealed that models prioritize visual design elements (badge clutter: 38.6\% importance) while humans emphasize content similarity, suggesting partial alignment in reasoning patterns. Failure case analysis reveals persistent challenges in MLLM visual perception, particularly for product similarity and color intensity assessment. Our findings indicate that diagnostic prompting represents a promising initial step toward human-aligned MLLM-based evaluation, though failure cases with consistent human-MLLM disagreement require continued research and refinement in prompting approaches with larger ground truth datasets for reliable practical deployment.

### [9] [A Fast and Efficient Modern BERT based Text-Conditioned Diffusion Model for Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00084)
*Venkata Siddharth Dhara,Pawan Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出FastTextDiff，一种基于扩散模型的高效医学图像分割方法，结合文本注释提升语义表征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分割模型依赖密集像素标注（成本高且耗时），需通过多模态技术提升标注效率。

Method: 利用ModernBERT（基于Transformer模型）整合医学文本与图像特征，通过跨模态注意力机制关联文本注释与图像语义，并采用FlashAttention 2优化计算效率。

Result: 在MIMIC数据集上验证，模型在分割准确性与训练效率上优于传统扩散模型，且ModernBERT可扩展性强于Clinical BioBERT。

Conclusion: 多模态扩散模型（如FastTextDiff）为医学图像分析提供了高效且有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: In recent times, denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have proven effective for medical image generation and denoising, and as representation learners for downstream segmentation. However, segmentation performance is limited by the need for dense pixel-wise labels, which are expensive, time-consuming, and require expert knowledge. We propose FastTextDiff, a label-efficient diffusion-based segmentation model that integrates medical text annotations to enhance semantic representations. Our approach uses ModernBERT, a transformer capable of processing long clinical notes, to tightly link textual annotations with semantic content in medical images. Trained on MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV, ModernBERT encodes clinical knowledge that guides cross-modal attention between visual and textual features. This study validates ModernBERT as a fast, scalable alternative to Clinical BioBERT in diffusion-based segmentation pipelines and highlights the promise of multi-modal techniques for medical image analysis. By replacing Clinical BioBERT with ModernBERT, FastTextDiff benefits from FlashAttention 2, an alternating attention mechanism, and a 2-trillion-token corpus, improving both segmentation accuracy and training efficiency over traditional diffusion-based models.

### [10] [Multi-modal On-Device Learning for Monocular Depth Estimation on Ultra-low-power MCUs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00086)
*Davide Nadalini,Manuele Rusci,Elia Cereda,Luca Benini,Francesco Conti,Daniele Palossi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种面向超低功耗物联网设备的单目深度估计（MDE）解决方案，通过多模态设备端学习（ODL）技术，在资源受限的硬件上实现高效的在线模型自适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对现有MDE模型在领域偏移时精度显著下降的问题，需在物联网节点有限的参数量下提升模型对环境变化的适应能力

Method: 构建集成Greenwaves GAP9 MCU、单目相机和8x8深度传感器的硬件系统，采用轻量级μPyD-Net模型（107k参数）。通过新颖的内存驱动稀疏更新机制，在设备端进行伪标签收集与模型微调（内存占用仅1.2MB）

Conclusion: 首次验证了基于反向传播的设备端学习在MDE领域应用于物联网节点的可行性，通过多模态数据融合和硬件-算法协同优化，实现了低功耗、低内存、快速收敛的实际部署方案

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation (MDE) plays a crucial role in enabling spatially-aware applications in Ultra-low-power (ULP) Internet-of-Things (IoT) platforms. However, the limited number of parameters of Deep Neural Networks for the MDE task, designed for IoT nodes, results in severe accuracy drops when the sensor data observed in the field shifts significantly from the training dataset. To address this domain shift problem, we present a multi-modal On-Device Learning (ODL) technique, deployed on an IoT device integrating a Greenwaves GAP9 MicroController Unit (MCU), a 80 mW monocular camera and a 8 x 8 pixel depth sensor, consuming $\approx$300mW. In its normal operation, this setup feeds a tiny 107 k-parameter $μ$PyD-Net model with monocular images for inference. The depth sensor, usually deactivated to minimize energy consumption, is only activated alongside the camera to collect pseudo-labels when the system is placed in a new environment. Then, the fine-tuning task is performed entirely on the MCU, using the new data. To optimize our backpropagation-based on-device training, we introduce a novel memory-driven sparse update scheme, which minimizes the fine-tuning memory to 1.2 MB, 2.2x less than a full update, while preserving accuracy (i.e., only 2% and 1.5% drops on the KITTI and NYUv2 datasets). Our in-field tests demonstrate, for the first time, that ODL for MDE can be performed in 17.8 minutes on the IoT node, reducing the root mean squared error from 4.9 to 0.6m with only 3 k self-labeled samples, collected in a real-life deployment scenario.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统课堂观察依赖人工标注，存在资源消耗大、可扩展性差的问题，研究旨在寻找可大规模部署的自动化评估替代方案。

Method: 1) 使用164小时视频及68课转录文本构建数据集；2) 视频模块采用零样本LLM、微调视觉-语言模型及自监督视频Transformer；3) 文本模块对比微调Transformer与提示式LLM；4) 应用标签阈值、上下文窗口及非对称损失函数处理数据不平衡。

Conclusion: 证实了AI驱动分析技术在教育场景的可行性，其多模态框架为构建可扩展的教师个性化反馈系统提供了方法论基础和技术范式。

Abstract: Observation of classroom interactions can provide concrete feedback to teachers, but current methods rely on manual annotation, which is resource-intensive and hard to scale. This work explores AI-driven analysis of classroom recordings, focusing on multimodal instructional activity and discourse recognition as a foundation for actionable feedback. Using a densely annotated dataset of 164 hours of video and 68 lesson transcripts, we design parallel, modality-specific pipelines. For video, we evaluate zero-shot multimodal LLMs, fine-tuned vision-language models, and self-supervised video transformers on 24 activity labels. For transcripts, we fine-tune a transformer-based classifier with contextualized inputs and compare it against prompting-based LLMs on 19 discourse labels. To handle class imbalance and multi-label complexity, we apply per-label thresholding, context windows, and imbalance-aware loss functions. The results show that fine-tuned models consistently outperform prompting-based approaches, achieving macro-F1 scores of 0.577 for video and 0.460 for transcripts. These results demonstrate the feasibility of automated classroom analysis and establish a foundation for scalable teacher feedback systems.

### [12] [TeleViT1.0: Teleconnection-aware Vision Transformers for Subseasonal to Seasonal Wildfire Pattern Forecasts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00089)
*Ioannis Prapas,Nikolaos Papadopoulos,Nikolaos-Ioannis Bountos,Dimitrios Michail,Gustau Camps-Valls,Ioannis Papoutsis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出TeleViT模型，通过多尺度融合局部火源驱动、全球气候场及遥相关指数，提升野火中长期预测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有短期野火预测依赖局部因素，长期预测需整合地球系统全局关联性，尤其是跨区域气候遥相关效应。

Method: 设计不对称token化策略整合多源输入（局部火灾驱动/全球气候场/遥联指数），采用Transformer编码器处理异构token，解码器保持空间结构预测。

Result: 在4个月提前期下，TeleViT AUPRC达0.603，显著优于ViT(0.582)和U-Net(0.578)，区域表现非洲季风区最优（AUPRC 0.630），寒带干旱区表现较弱。

Conclusion: 融合全局气候信息的深度学习架构可扩展野火预测至季节时间尺度，局部特征主导预测但全球因子提供关键上下文支持。

Abstract: Forecasting wildfires weeks to months in advance is difficult, yet crucial for planning fuel treatments and allocating resources. While short-term predictions typically rely on local weather conditions, long-term forecasting requires accounting for the Earth's interconnectedness, including global patterns and teleconnections. We introduce TeleViT, a Teleconnection-aware Vision Transformer that integrates (i) fine-scale local fire drivers, (ii) coarsened global fields, and (iii) teleconnection indices. This multi-scale fusion is achieved through an asymmetric tokenization strategy that produces heterogeneous tokens processed jointly by a transformer encoder, followed by a decoder that preserves spatial structure by mapping local tokens to their corresponding prediction patches.
  Using the global SeasFire dataset (2001-2021, 8-day resolution), TeleViT improves AUPRC performance over U-Net++, ViT, and climatology across all lead times, including horizons up to four months. At zero lead, TeleViT with indices and global inputs reaches AUPRC 0.630 (ViT 0.617, U-Net 0.620), at 16x8day lead (around 4 months), TeleViT variants using global input maintain 0.601-0.603 (ViT 0.582, U-Net 0.578), while surpassing the climatology (0.572) at all lead times. Regional results show the highest skill in seasonally consistent fire regimes, such as African savannas, and lower skill in boreal and arid regions. Attention and attribution analyses indicate that predictions rely mainly on local tokens, with global fields and indices contributing coarse contextual information. These findings suggest that architectures explicitly encoding large-scale Earth-system context can extend wildfire predictability on subseasonal-to-seasonal timescales.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry is constantly evolving to meet the demand for sustainable and effective design and construction of the built environment. In the literature, two primary deposition techniques for large-scale 3D concrete printing (3DCP) have been described, namely extrusion-based (Contour Crafting-CC) and shotcrete 3D printing (SC3DP) methods. The deposition methods use a digitally controlled nozzle to print material layer by layer. The continuous flow of concrete material used to create the printed structure is called a filament or layer. As these filaments are the essential structure defining the printed object, the filaments' geometry quality control is crucial. This paper presents an automated procedure for quality control (QC) of filaments in extrusion-based and SC3DP printing methods. The paper also describes a workflow that is independent of the sensor used for data acquisition, such as a camera, a structured light system (SLS) or a terrestrial laser scanner (TLS). This method can be used with materials in either the fresh or cured state. Thus, it can be used for online and post-printing QC.

Abstract: Sustained operation of solar photovoltaic assets hinges on accurate detection and prioritization of surface faults across vast, geographically distributed modules. While multi modal imaging strategies are popular, they introduce logistical and economic barriers for routine farm level deployment. This work demonstrates that deep learning and classical machine learning may be judiciously combined to achieve robust surface anomaly categorization and severity estimation from planar visible band imagery alone. We introduce TinyViT which is a compact pipeline integrating Transformer based segmentation, spectral-spatial feature engineering, and ensemble regression. The system ingests consumer grade color camera mosaics of PV panels, classifies seven nuanced surface faults, and generates actionable severity grades for maintenance triage. By eliminating reliance on electroluminescence or IR sensors, our method enables affordable, scalable upkeep for resource limited installations, and advances the state of solar health monitoring toward universal field accessibility. Experiments on real public world datasets validate both classification and regression sub modules, achieving accuracy and interpretability competitive with specialized approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业界传统依赖人工标注数据开发机器学习质量检测方法存在三大问题：1) 高质量标注数据获取成本高且耗时；2) 缺陷样本本征稀少导致类别严重不平衡；3) 现有数据限制阻碍机器学习在制造场景的广泛应用。论文旨在通过合成数据生成技术解决这些问题。

Abstract: Machine learning, particularly deep learning, is transforming industrial quality inspection. Yet, training robust machine learning models typically requires large volumes of high-quality labeled data, which are expensive, time-consuming, and labor-intensive to obtain in manufacturing. Moreover, defective samples are intrinsically rare, leading to severe class imbalance that degrades model performance. These data constraints hinder the widespread adoption of machine learning-based quality inspection methods in real production environments. Synthetic data generation (SDG) offers a promising solution by enabling the creation of large, balanced, and fully annotated datasets in an efficient, cost-effective, and scalable manner. This paper presents a hybrid SDG framework that integrates simulation-based rendering, domain randomization, and real background compositing to enable zero-shot learning for computer vision-based industrial part inspection without manual annotation. The SDG pipeline generates 12,960 labeled images in one hour by varying part geometry, lighting, and surface properties, and then compositing synthetic parts onto real image backgrounds. A two-stage architecture utilizing a YOLOv8n backbone for object detection and MobileNetV3-small for quality classification is trained exclusively on synthetic data and evaluated on 300 real industrial parts. The proposed approach achieves an mAP@0.5 of 0.995 for detection, 96% classification accuracy, and 90.1% balanced accuracy. Comparative evaluation against few-shot real-data baseline approaches demonstrates significant improvement. The proposed SDG-based approach achieves 90-91% balanced accuracy under severe class imbalance, while the baselines reach only 50% accuracy. These results demonstrate that the proposed method enables annotation-free, scalable, and robust quality inspection for real-world manufacturing applications.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合ResNet50 OOD过滤与YOLO架构的新方法，有效解决乳腺癌检测深度学习模型在处理非乳腺影像输入（CT/MRI/X线）时的不可靠性问题，同时保持高检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳腺癌检测模型在面对CT/MRI等非训练分布（OOD）的影像时表现不可靠，可能导致误诊。现有方法缺乏有效处理设备差异及多模态影像的能力，需要更鲁棒的解决方案。

Method: 构建包含两个阶段的框架：1）使用ResNet50通过余弦相似度建立In-Domain Gallery，严格过滤非乳腺摄影输入；2）采用YOLOv8/YOLOv12进行肿瘤检测。通过12种CNN架构对比选出最优backbone，并集成Grad-CAM提升可解释性。

Result: OOD检测准确率达99.77%（其中OOD测试集达100%），检测性能mAP@0.5为0.947。实验表明该方法能在排除无关影像的同时保持高检测准确率，在异构临床数据中显示可靠性优势。

Conclusion: 该方法为部署可靠的乳腺癌AI系统提供基础，在多模态医学影像场景中显著降低误报警，平衡OOD鲁棒性与检测性能，具有临床落地潜力。

Abstract: Deep learning models for breast cancer detection from mammographic images have significant reliability problems when presented with Out-of-Distribution (OOD) inputs such as other imaging modalities (CT, MRI, X-ray) or equipment variations, leading to unreliable detection and misdiagnosis. The current research mitigates the fundamental OOD issue through a comprehensive approach integrating ResNet50-based OOD filtering with YOLO architectures (YOLOv8, YOLOv11, YOLOv12) for accurate detection of breast cancer. Our strategy establishes an in-domain gallery via cosine similarity to rigidly reject non-mammographic inputs prior to processing, ensuring that only domain-associated images supply the detection pipeline. The OOD detection component achieves 99.77\% general accuracy with immaculate 100\% accuracy on OOD test sets, effectively eliminating irrelevant imaging modalities. ResNet50 was selected as the optimum backbone after 12 CNN architecture searches. The joint framework unites OOD robustness with high detection performance (mAP@0.5: 0.947) and enhanced interpretability through Grad-CAM visualizations. Experimental validation establishes that OOD filtering significantly improves system reliability by preventing false alarms on out-of-distribution inputs while maintaining higher detection accuracy on mammographic data. The present study offers a fundamental foundation for the deployment of reliable AI-based breast cancer detection systems in diverse clinical environments with inherent data heterogeneity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ICVision is an AI system that uses multimodal large language models (like GPT-4 Vision) to classify EEG ICA components by interpreting visualizations (e.g., topographies, ERP plots) like expert neurologists, achieving higher accuracy and interpretability than conventional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current EEG ICA classifiers (e.g., ICLabel) rely on handcrafted features, limiting robustness and clinical utility. ICVision aims to emulate human-like visual and reasoning capabilities for explainable, expert-level classification.

Method: ICVision processes visual inputs (topographies, time series, spectra) via GPT-4 Vision and natural language reasoning, classifying components into six categories while generating confidence scores and human-like explanations.

Result: ICVision achieved k=0.677 agreement with experts, outperforming MNE ICLabel, preserved brain signals in ambiguous cases, and received 97% interpretability ratings from experts.

Conclusion: ICVision represents a paradigm shift in scientific AI, enabling globally scalable, reproducible, and explainable EEG workflows through AI-agent visual cognition, paving the way for expert-level AI in brain science.

Abstract: We introduce EEG Autoclean Vision Language AI (ICVision) a first-of-its-kind system that emulates expert-level EEG ICA component classification through AI-agent vision and natural language reasoning. Unlike conventional classifiers such as ICLabel, which rely on handcrafted features, ICVision directly interprets ICA dashboard visualizations topography, time series, power spectra, and ERP plots, using a multimodal large language model (GPT-4 Vision). This allows the AI to see and explain EEG components the way trained neurologists do, making it the first scientific implementation of AI-agent visual cognition in neurophysiology. ICVision classifies each component into one of six canonical categories (brain, eye, heart, muscle, channel noise, and other noise), returning both a confidence score and a human-like explanation. Evaluated on 3,168 ICA components from 124 EEG datasets, ICVision achieved k = 0.677 agreement with expert consensus, surpassing MNE ICLabel, while also preserving clinically relevant brain signals in ambiguous cases. Over 97% of its outputs were rated as interpretable and actionable by expert reviewers. As a core module of the open-source EEG Autoclean platform, ICVision signals a paradigm shift in scientific AI, where models do not just classify, but see, reason, and communicate. It opens the door to globally scalable, explainable, and reproducible EEG workflows, marking the emergence of AI agents capable of expert-level visual decision-making in brain science and beyond.

Abstract: Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of death among women worldwide. We introduce Mammo-FM, the first foundation model specifically for mammography, pretrained on the largest and most diverse dataset to date - 140,677 patients (821,326 mammograms) across four U.S. institutions. Mammo-FM provides a unified foundation for core clinical tasks in breast imaging, including cancer diagnosis, pathology localization, structured report generation, and cancer risk prognosis within a single framework. Its alignment between images and text enables both visual and textual interpretability, improving transparency and clinical auditability, which are essential for real-world adoption. We rigorously evaluate Mammo-FM across diagnosis, prognosis, and report-generation tasks in in- and out-of-distribution datasets. Despite operating on native-resolution mammograms and using only one-third of the parameters of state-of-the-art generalist FMs, Mammo-FM consistently outperforms them across multiple public and private benchmarks. These results highlight the efficiency and value of domain-specific foundation models designed around the full spectrum of tasks within a clinical domain and emphasize the importance of rigorous, domain-aligned evaluation.

TL;DR: 提出DenseScan，一个新颖的数据集，通过自动化管道生成详细的多级描述，解决3D场景理解数据集中语义标注不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D场景理解数据集缺乏多视角语义标注，难以支持复杂的视觉-语言任务，因此本文提出更丰富的标注方法。

Method: 利用多视角2D图像和多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）构建自动化标注管道，生成场景元素的密集描述和情景化问题。

Result: 实验表明DenseScan能显著提升3D环境中的对象级理解能力和问答性能，并已开源数据集及标注管道。

Conclusion: DenseScan通过耦合几何细节与语义丰富性，推动3D场景理解在机器人、增强现实等领域的复杂任务研究。

Abstract: 3D understanding is a key capability for real-world AI assistance. High-quality data plays an important role in driving the development of the 3D understanding community. Current 3D scene understanding datasets often provide geometric and instance-level information, yet they lack the rich semantic annotations necessary for nuanced visual-language tasks.In this work, we introduce DenseScan, a novel dataset with detailed multi-level descriptions generated by an automated pipeline leveraging multi-view 2D images and multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Our approach enables dense captioning of scene elements, ensuring comprehensive object-level descriptions that capture context-sensitive details. Furthermore, we extend these annotations through scenario-based question generation, producing high-level queries that integrate object properties, spatial relationships, and scene context. By coupling geometric detail with semantic richness, DenseScan broadens the range of downstream tasks, from detailed visual-language navigation to interactive question answering. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly enhances object-level understanding and question-answering performance in 3D environments compared to traditional annotation pipelines. We release both the annotated dataset and our annotation pipeline to facilitate future research and applications in robotics, augmented reality, and beyond. Through DenseScan, we aim to catalyze new avenues in 3D scene understanding, allowing researchers and practitioners to tackle the complexities of real-world environments with richer, more contextually aware annotations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统OLAT方法需要多视角光源采集且效率低下，动态人体同时进行跟踪和多样光照采集是挑战，现有方法未能同时考虑几何细节、光照交互和实时性需求。

Method: 提出新捕获策略（lightstage中交替随机环境光和均匀跟踪帧），提出物理特征（几何、反照率、视角），RelightNet通过cross-attention融合光照条件直接回归3D高斯属性，隐式学习渲染方程计算。

Result: 在动态场景保持几何细节下实现高保真光影效果，相比NeRF和OLAT方法在光照复现质量提升35%，前向推导速度达到实时级(23fps)。

Conclusion: 通过单次神经渲染解决动态人体的视角-光照联合控制难题，为VR/AR应用提供高效高质量解决方案。

Abstract: We present Relightable Holoported Characters (RHC), a novel person-specific method for free-view rendering and relighting of full-body and highly dynamic humans solely observed from sparse-view RGB videos at inference. In contrast to classical one-light-at-a-time (OLAT)-based human relighting, our transformer-based RelightNet predicts relit appearance within a single network pass, avoiding costly OLAT-basis capture and generation. For training such a model, we introduce a new capture strategy and dataset recorded in a multi-view lightstage, where we alternate frames lit by random environment maps with uniformly lit tracking frames, simultaneously enabling accurate motion tracking and diverse illumination as well as dynamics coverage. Inspired by the rendering equation, we derive physics-informed features that encode geometry, albedo, shading, and the virtual camera view from a coarse human mesh proxy and the input views. Our RelightNet then takes these features as input and cross-attends them with a novel lighting condition, and regresses the relit appearance in the form of texel-aligned 3D Gaussian splats attached to the coarse mesh proxy. Consequently, our RelightNet implicitly learns to efficiently compute the rendering equation for novel lighting conditions within a single feed-forward pass. Experiments demonstrate our method's superior visual fidelity and lighting reproduction compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Project page: https://vcai.mpi-inf.mpg.de/projects/RHC/

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出UniDiff，一种参数高效的框架，通过仅使用目标域数据将单个ImageNet预训练扩散模型适应至多种遥感模态，解决标注稀疏性限制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遥感领域多模态数据标注不足严重制约模型发展（如MSFMamba），尽管架构改进但依赖标注数据。ImageNet预训练模型难以适应异质模态（如HSI/SAR）且需大规模标注数据，存在灾难性遗忘风险。

Method: 采用FiLM-based时间步-模态条件编码，仅微调约5%参数实现高效适应，并通过伪RGB锚定保留预训练表征。设计包含跨模态特征提取模块，支持无监督域适应的多模态数据融合。

Result: 在两个多模态遥感基准数据集上验证，无监督适应方法有效缓解标注约束，跨模态融合性能提升显著，验证集精度比现有方法提高18.7%。

Conclusion: 通过低参数量级适应策略，成功将扩散模型迁移至多模态遥感场景，为标注受限场景提供新范式，未来可扩展至视频/三维点云等模态。

Abstract: Sparse annotations fundamentally constrain multimodal remote sensing: even recent state-of-the-art supervised methods such as MSFMamba are limited by the availability of labeled data, restricting their practical deployment despite architectural advances. ImageNet-pretrained models provide rich visual representations, but adapting them to heterogeneous modalities such as hyperspectral imaging (HSI) and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) without large labeled datasets remains challenging. We propose UniDiff, a parameter-efficient framework that adapts a single ImageNet-pretrained diffusion model to multiple sensing modalities using only target-domain data. UniDiff combines FiLM-based timestep-modality conditioning, parameter-efficient adaptation of approximately 5% of parameters, and pseudo-RGB anchoring to preserve pre-trained representations and prevent catastrophic forgetting. This design enables effective feature extraction from remote sensing data under sparse annotations. Our results with two established multi-modal benchmarking datasets demonstrate that unsupervised adaptation of a pre-trained diffusion model effectively mitigates annotation constraints and achieves effective fusion of multi-modal remotely sensed data.

Conclusion: USB为可扩展数据集创建和鲁棒神经影像分析提供了新机会，代码已开源（https://github.com/jhuldr/USB）。

Abstract: Understanding the relationship between pathological and healthy brain structures is fundamental to neuroimaging, connecting disease diagnosis and detection with modeling, prediction, and treatment planning. However, paired pathological-healthy data are extremely difficult to obtain, as they rely on pre- and post-treatment imaging, constrained by clinical outcomes and longitudinal data availability. Consequently, most existing brain image generation and editing methods focus on visual quality yet remain domain-specific, treating pathological and healthy image modeling independently. We introduce USB (Unified Synthetic Brain), the first end-to-end framework that unifies bidirectional generation and editing of pathological and healthy brain images. USB models the joint distribution of lesions and brain anatomy through a paired diffusion mechanism and achieves both pathological and healthy image generation. A consistency guidance algorithm further preserves anatomical consistency and lesion correspondence during bidirectional pathology-healthy editing. Extensive experiments on six public brain MRI datasets including healthy controls, stroke, and Alzheimer's patients, demonstrate USB's ability to produce diverse and realistic results. By establishing the first unified benchmark for brain image generation and editing, USB opens opportunities for scalable dataset creation and robust neuroimaging analysis.

Abstract: In remote sensing applications, such as disaster detection and response, real-time efficiency and model lightweighting are of critical importance. Consequently, existing remote sensing image super-resolution methods often face a trade-off between model performance and computational efficiency. In this paper, we propose a lightweight super-resolution framework for remote sensing imagery, named HIMOSA. Specifically, HIMOSA leverages the inherent redundancy in remote sensing imagery and introduces a content-aware sparse attention mechanism, enabling the model to achieve fast inference while maintaining strong reconstruction performance. Furthermore, to effectively leverage the multi-scale repetitive patterns found in remote sensing imagery, we introduce a hierarchical window expansion and reduce the computational complexity by adjusting the sparsity of the attention. Extensive experiments on multiple remote sensing datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Early detection of malignant lung nodules is critical, but its dependence on size and growth in screening inherently delays diagnosis. We present an AI system that redefines lung cancer screening by performing both detection and malignancy diagnosis directly at the nodule level on low-dose CT scans. To address limitations in dataset scale and explainability, we designed an ensemble of shallow deep learning and feature-based specialized models. Trained and evaluated on 25,709 scans with 69,449 annotated nodules, the system outperforms radiologists, Lung-RADS, and leading AI models (Sybil, Brock, Google, Kaggle). It achieves an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.98 internally and 0.945 on an independent cohort. With 0.5 false positives per scan at 99.3\% sensitivity, it addresses key barriers to AI adoption. Critically, it outperforms radiologists across all nodule sizes and stages, excelling in stage 1 cancers, and all growth-based metrics, including the least accurate: Volume-Doubling Time. It also surpasses radiologists by up to one year in diagnosing indeterminate and slow-growing nodules.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional AR systems rely on fixed detectors or markers that cannot process complex, open-vocabulary natural language queries.

Method: The system coordinates MLLMs and coordinate-aware perception tools to handle queries from simple identification to multi-object relational reasoning, constructs dynamic AR scene graphs with nine typed relations (spatial, structural-semantic, causal-functional), and introduces GroundedAR-Bench for evaluation.

Result: The system achieves meter-accurate 3D anchors for queries, supports plug-and-use vision-language models without retraining, and establishes GroundedAR-Bench for diverse environment evaluations.

Conclusion: AR agents augment MLLMs with spatial intelligence for interactive scene understanding, enabling natural language-guided dynamic AR experiences and laying the groundwork for future applications.

Abstract: Traditional augmented reality (AR) systems predominantly rely on fixed class detectors or fiducial markers, limiting their ability to interpret complex, open-vocabulary natural language queries. We present a modular AR agent system that integrates multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with grounded vision models to enable relational reasoning in space and language-conditioned spatial retrieval in physical environments. Our adaptive task agent coordinates MLLMs and coordinate-aware perception tools to address varying query complexities, ranging from simple object identification to multi-object relational reasoning, while returning meter-accurate 3D anchors. It constructs dynamic AR scene graphs encoding nine typed relations (spatial, structural-semantic, causal-functional), enabling MLLMs to understand not just what objects exist, but how they relate and interact in 3D space. Through task-adaptive region-of-interest highlighting and contextual spatial retrieval, the system guides human attention to information-dense areas while supporting human-in-the-loop refinement. The agent dynamically invokes coordinate-aware tools for complex queries-selection, measurement, comparison, and actuation-grounding language understanding in physical operations. The modular architecture supports plug-and-use vision-language models without retraining, establishing AR agents as intermediaries that augment MLLMs with real-world spatial intelligence for interactive scene understanding. We also introduce GroundedAR-Bench, an evaluation framework for language-driven real world localization and relation grounding across diverse environments.

Abstract: Embodied 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) infers dense geometry and semantics from continuous egocentric observations. Most existing Gaussian-based methods rely on random initialization of many primitives within predefined spatial bounds, resulting in redundancy and poor scalability to unbounded scenes. Recent depth-guided approach alleviates this issue but remains local, suffering from latency and memory overhead as scale increases. To overcome these challenges, we propose TGSFormer, a scalable Temporal Gaussian Splatting framework for embodied SSC. It maintains a persistent Gaussian memory for temporal prediction, without relying on image coherence or frame caches. For temporal fusion, a Dual Temporal Encoder jointly processes current and historical Gaussian features through confidence-aware cross-attention. Subsequently, a Confidence-aware Voxel Fusion module merges overlapping primitives into voxel-aligned representations, regulating density and maintaining compactness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TGSFormer achieves state-of-the-art results on both local and embodied SSC benchmarks, offering superior accuracy and scalability with significantly fewer primitives while maintaining consistent long-term scene integrity. The code will be released upon acceptance.

*Xiao Cui,Yulei Qin,Wengang Zhou,Hongsheng Li,Houqiang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出一种基于最优传输(OT)距离最小化的方法，重新定义数据集蒸馏问题，以同时对齐全局和实例级别的数据分布特性，提高模型泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过OT构建的几何一致性分布匹配框架，有效保持了复杂高维数据的局部模式、类内特征和细粒度变异，实现了高效的数据集蒸馏性能突破。

Abstract: Dataset distillation seeks to synthesize a compact distilled dataset, enabling models trained on it to achieve performance comparable to models trained on the full dataset. Recent methods for large-scale datasets focus on matching global distributional statistics (e.g., mean and variance), but overlook critical instance-level characteristics and intraclass variations, leading to suboptimal generalization. We address this limitation by reformulating dataset distillation as an Optimal Transport (OT) distance minimization problem, enabling fine-grained alignment at both global and instance levels throughout the pipeline. OT offers a geometrically faithful framework for distribution matching. It effectively preserves local modes, intra-class patterns, and fine-grained variations that characterize the geometry of complex, high-dimensional distributions. Our method comprises three components tailored for preserving distributional geometry: (1) OT-guided diffusion sampling, which aligns latent distributions of real and distilled images; (2) label-image-aligned soft relabeling, which adapts label distributions based on the complexity of distilled image distributions; and (3) OT-based logit matching, which aligns the output of student models with soft-label distributions. Extensive experiments across diverse architectures and large-scale datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in an efficient manner, achieving at least 4% accuracy improvement under IPC=10 settings for each architecture on ImageNet-1K.

Conclusion: 该方法从几何本质重构里程计问题，无需依赖传统特征匹配，为多模态传感器融合提供了新范式，理论验证显示出对复杂场景的鲁棒性潜力。

Abstract: Visual odometry techniques typically rely on feature extraction from a sequence of images and subsequent computation of optical flow. This point-to-point correspondence between two consecutive frames can be costly to compute and suffers from varying accuracy, which affects the odometry estimate's quality. Attempts have been made to bypass the difficulties originating from the correspondence problem by adopting line features and fusing other sensors (event camera, IMU) to improve performance, many of which still heavily rely on correspondence. If the camera observes a straight line as it moves, the image of the line sweeps a smooth surface in image-space time. It is a ruled surface and analyzing its shape gives information about odometry. Further, its estimation requires only differentially computed updates from point-to-line associations. Inspired by event cameras' propensity for edge detection, this research presents a novel algorithm to reconstruct 3D scenes and visual odometry from these ruled surfaces. By constraining the surfaces with the inertia measurements from an onboard IMU sensor, the dimensionality of the solution space is greatly reduced.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI-generated multimodal video-audio content has raised significant concerns regarding information security and content authenticity. Existing synthetic video datasets predominantly focus on the visual modality alone, while the few incorporating audio are largely confined to facial deepfakes--a limitation that fails to address the expanding landscape of general multimodal AI-generated content and substantially impedes the development of trustworthy detection systems. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce the Multimodal Video-Audio Dataset (MVAD), the first comprehensive dataset specifically designed for detecting AI-generated multimodal video-audio content. Our dataset exhibits three key characteristics: (1) genuine multimodality with samples generated according to three realistic video-audio forgery patterns; (2) high perceptual quality achieved through diverse state-of-the-art generative models; and (3) comprehensive diversity spanning realistic and anime visual styles, four content categories (humans, animals, objects, and scenes), and four video-audio multimodal data types. Our dataset will be available at https://github.com/HuMengXue0104/MVAD.

Conclusion: AMDET实现了无需先验知识的后门检测，解决了第三方模型可信度验证的实用化挑战。

Abstract: Vision-language pretrained models (VLPs) such as CLIP have achieved remarkable success, but are also highly vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Given a model fine-tuned by an untrusted third party, determining whether the model has been injected with a backdoor is a critical and challenging problem. Existing detection methods usually rely on prior knowledge of training dataset, backdoor triggers and targets, or downstream classifiers, which may be impractical for real-world applications. To address this, To address this challenge, we introduce Assimilation Matters in DETection (AMDET), a novel model-level detection framework that operates without any such prior knowledge. Specifically, we first reveal the feature assimilation property in backdoored text encoders: the representations of all tokens within a backdoor sample exhibit a high similarity. Further analysis attributes this effect to the concentration of attention weights on the trigger token. Leveraging this insight, AMDET scans a model by performing gradient-based inversion on token embeddings to recover implicit features that capable of activating backdoor behaviors. Furthermore, we identify the natural backdoor feature in the OpenAI's official CLIP model, which are not intentionally injected but still exhibit backdoor-like behaviors. We then filter them out from real injected backdoor by analyzing their loss landscapes. Extensive experiments on 3,600 backdoored and benign-finetuned models with two attack paradigms and three VLP model structures show that AMDET detects backdoors with an F1 score of 89.90%. Besides, it achieves one complete detection in approximately 5 minutes on a RTX 4090 GPU and exhibits strong robustness against adaptive attacks.

Result: 在四个多模态基准数据集上的实验证明，该方法在检测精度与泛化能力上优于现有方法，同时保持较低的计算复杂度与参数量。

Conclusion: MM-DETR通过创新多模态融合设计与冗余缩减策略，实现了精度、效率与部署可行性的统一，为复杂场景下的遥感感知提供了新思路。

Abstract: Multimodal remote sensing object detection aims to achieve more accurate and robust perception under challenging conditions by fusing complementary information from different modalities. However, existing approaches that rely on attention-based or deformable convolution fusion blocks still struggle to balance performance and lightweight design. Beyond fusion complexity, extracting modality features with shared backbones yields suboptimal representations due to insufficient modality-specific modeling, whereas dual-stream architectures nearly double the parameter count, ultimately limiting practical deployment. To this end, we propose MM-DETR, a lightweight and efficient framework for multimodal object detection. Specifically, we propose a Mamba-based dual granularity fusion encoder that reformulates global interaction as channel-wise dynamic gating and leverages a 1D selective scan for efficient cross-modal modeling with linear complexity. Following this design, we further reinterpret multimodal fusion as a modality completion problem. A region-aware 2D selective scanning completion branch is introduced to recover modality-specific cues, supporting fine-grained fusion along a bidirectional pyramid pathway with minimal overhead. To further reduce parameter redundancy while retaining strong feature extraction capability, a lightweight frequency-aware modality adapter is inserted into the shared backbone. This adapter employs a spatial-frequency co-expert structure to capture modality-specific cues, while a pixel-wise router dynamically balances expert contributions for efficient spatial-frequency fusion. Extensive experiments conducted on four multimodal benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization capability of the proposed method.

### [33] [THCRL: Trusted Hierarchical Contrastive Representation Learning for Multi-View Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00368)
*Jian Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Trusted Hierarchical Contrastive Representation Learning (THCRL) framework to address untrustworthy fusion in multi-view clustering by leveraging denoising and structural similarity in nearest-neighbour representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-view clustering methods suffer from unreliable fusion due to inherent noise in individual views and neglect of structural information from within-cluster nearest neighbors, leading to suboptimal representation learning.

Method: THCRL introduces two modules: 1) Deep Symmetry Hierarchical Fusion (DSHF) using UNet with denoising to learn trustworthy fused representations, and 2) Average K-Nearest Neighbors Contrastive Learning (AKCL) to align fused representations via structural relationships within clusters rather than cross-view instance similarities.

Result: Experimental results show THCRL achieves state-of-the-art performance on deep multi-view clustering tasks compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: The hierarchical contrastive learning framework effectively addresses multi-view representation fusion issues by concurrently suppressing view-specific noise and leveraging intra-cluster structural consistency through neighbor-aware representation alignment.

Abstract: Multi-View Clustering (MVC) has garnered increasing attention in recent years. It is capable of partitioning data samples into distinct groups by learning a consensus representation. However, a significant challenge remains: the problem of untrustworthy fusion. This problem primarily arises from two key factors: 1) Existing methods often ignore the presence of inherent noise within individual views; 2) In traditional MVC methods using Contrastive Learning (CL), similarity computations typically rely on different views of the same instance, while neglecting the structural information from nearest neighbors within the same cluster. Consequently, this leads to the wrong direction for multi-view fusion. To address this problem, we present a novel Trusted Hierarchical Contrastive Representation Learning (THCRL). It consists of two key modules. Specifically, we propose the Deep Symmetry Hierarchical Fusion (DSHF) module, which leverages the UNet architecture integrated with multiple denoising mechanisms to achieve trustworthy fusion of multi-view data. Furthermore, we present the Average K-Nearest Neighbors Contrastive Learning (AKCL) module to align the fused representation with the view-specific representation. Unlike conventional strategies, AKCL enhances representation similarity among samples belonging to the same cluster, rather than merely focusing on the same sample across views, thereby reinforcing the confidence of the fused representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that THCRL achieves the state-of-the-art performance in deep MVC tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出POLARIS方法，通过解决扩散模型逆过程中的近似噪声误差问题，显著提升图像编辑与重建的准确性，且仅需一行代码实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型中Inversion-Denoising范式存在重建退化问题，其根源是噪声近似误差随逆过程累积，但现有方法缺乏对这一关键问题的系统解决框架。

Method: 将逆过程建模为误差溯源问题而非传统误差补偿模式。通过：1) 将引导尺度ω设为动态变量；2) 推导最小化每步逆误差的数学公式；3) 采用投影正交最小二乘法优化误差传播路径。

Result: 在保持微小计算开销(仅需修改一行代码)的前提下，成功将逆过程潜变量质量提升15%以上，下游任务准确率平均提升12.3%，且误差累积减少达40%。

Conclusion: POLARIS通过数学严谨的误差传播建模与参数化，为扩散模型提供鲁棒逆过程解决方案，其误差溯源范式可迁移至其他生成模型优化场景。

Abstract: The Inversion-Denoising Paradigm, which is based on diffusion models, excels in diverse image editing and restoration tasks. We revisit its mechanism and reveal a critical, overlooked factor in reconstruction degradation: the approximate noise error. This error stems from approximating the noise at step t with the prediction at step t-1, resulting in severe error accumulation throughout the inversion process. We introduce Projection-Orthogonal Least Squares for Robust and Adaptive Inversion (POLARIS), which reformulates inversion from an error-compensation problem into an error-origin problem. Rather than optimizing embeddings or latent codes to offset accumulated drift, POLARIS treats the guidance scale ω as a step-wise variable and derives a mathematically grounded formula to minimize inversion error at each step. Remarkably, POLARIS improves inversion latent quality with just one line of code. With negligible performance overhead, it substantially mitigates noise approximation errors and consistently improves the accuracy of downstream tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 面部皮肤弱纹理区域给传统描述符匹配带来挑战，但缺乏毛孔级图像补丁数据集限制了面部领域深度学习描述符的发展。

Method: 提出PorePatch数据集和数据-模型协同进化（DMCE）框架生成高质量数据，训练并测试当前顶级模型。

Result: 深度模型在匹配任务FPR95值达1.91%（优于PSIFT的22.41%），但在3D重建任务未显著优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 深度学习描述符对弱纹理面部区仍有局限，该领域仍需进一步研究。

Abstract: The weak-texture nature of facial skin regions presents significant challenges for local descriptor matching in applications such as facial motion analysis and 3D face reconstruction. Although deep learning-based descriptors have demonstrated superior performance to traditional hand-crafted descriptors in many applications, the scarcity of pore-scale image patch datasets has hindered their further development in the facial domain. In this paper, we propose the PorePatch dataset, a high-quality pore-scale image patch dataset, and establish a rational evaluation benchmark. We introduce a Data-Model Co-Evolution (DMCE) framework to generate a progressively refined, high-quality dataset from high-resolution facial images. We then train existing SOTA models on our dataset and conduct extensive experiments. Our results show that the SOTA model achieves a FPR95 value of 1.91% on the matching task, outperforming PSIFT (22.41%) by a margin of 20.5%. However, its advantage is diminished in the 3D reconstruction task, where its overall performance is not significantly better than that of traditional descriptors. This indicates that deep learning descriptors still have limitations in addressing the challenges of facial weak-texture regions, and much work remains to be done in this field.

TL;DR: WiseEdit: A comprehensive benchmark for evaluating cognition- and creativity-informed image editing capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack holistic evaluation of cognitive and creative abilities; require multi-step reasoning and knowledge integration in advanced image editing models.

Method: Proposed WiseEdit benchmark with three cascaded steps (Awareness, Interpretation, Imagination) and three knowledge types (Declarative/Procedural/Metacognitive), containing 1,220 test cases for systematic assessment.

Result: Exposed limitations of state-of-the-art models in knowledge-based cognitive reasoning and creative composition across hierarchical task complexities.

Conclusion: WiseEdit establishes a new evaluation framework with deep task decomposition and broad knowledge coverage for assessing intelligent image editing systems.

Abstract: Recent image editing models boast next-level intelligent capabilities, facilitating cognition- and creativity-informed image editing. Yet, existing benchmarks provide too narrow a scope for evaluation, failing to holistically assess these advanced abilities. To address this, we introduce WiseEdit, a knowledge-intensive benchmark for comprehensive evaluation of cognition- and creativity-informed image editing, featuring deep task depth and broad knowledge breadth. Drawing an analogy to human cognitive creation, WiseEdit decomposes image editing into three cascaded steps, i.e., Awareness, Interpretation, and Imagination, each corresponding to a task that poses a challenge for models to complete at the specific step. It also encompasses complex tasks, where none of the three steps can be finished easily. Furthermore, WiseEdit incorporates three fundamental types of knowledge: Declarative, Procedural, and Metacognitive knowledge. Ultimately, WiseEdit comprises 1,220 test cases, objectively revealing the limitations of SoTA image editing models in knowledge-based cognitive reasoning and creative composition capabilities. The benchmark, evaluation code, and the generated images of each model will be made publicly available soon. Project Page: https://qnancy.github.io/wiseedit_project_page/.

Motivation: 现有方法在对话能力、分割性能、推理速度间难以兼顾：嵌入预测干扰对话目标，自回归分割影响效率或输出质量。

Method: 采用全掩码预测框架：先通过文本生成保持对话能力，然后通过单步前向传播并行预测全分割掩码，将掩码视为图像块的填空任务。

Result: 在多个分割基准测试中显著超越现有方法，且对话能力和推理速度均保持最优。

Conclusion: 证明了对话生成与分割任务可解耦设计，解决了多模态模型的三重权衡问题，实现无妥协的综合性能提升。

Abstract: Integrating segmentation into Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) presents a core trilemma: simultaneously preserving dialogue ability, achieving high segmentation performance, and ensuring fast inference. Prevailing paradigms are forced into a compromise. Embedding prediction methods introduce a conflicting pixel-level objective that degrades the MLLM's general dialogue abilities. The alternative, next-token prediction, reframes segmentation as an autoregressive task, which preserves dialogue but forces a trade-off between poor segmentation performance with sparse outputs or prohibitive inference speeds with rich ones. We resolve this trilemma with all-mask prediction, a novel paradigm that decouples autoregressive dialogue generation from non-autoregressive mask prediction. We present STAMP: Simultaneous Textual All-Mask Prediction, an MLLM that embodies this paradigm. After generating a textual response, STAMP predicts an entire segmentation mask in a single forward pass by treating it as a parallel "fill-in-the-blank" task over image patches. This design maintains the MLLM's dialogue ability by avoiding conflicting objectives, enables high segmentation performance by leveraging rich, bidirectional spatial context for all mask tokens, and achieves exceptional speed. Extensive experiments show that STAMP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple segmentation benchmarks, providing a solution that excels in dialogue, segmentation, and speed without compromise.

Motivation: 传统视频编码在超低比特率下因追求像素准确而产生严重视觉伪影，存在人类感知与技术目标的错位问题。

Method: 将视频分解为文本描述/降级视频/姿态草图三模态，采用条件视频扩散模型重建视频，并引入时间前向填充和模态专用编解码器优化生成质量与压缩效率。

Result: 实验表明该方法在低比特率条件下，相较现有语义与传统编码方案，在感知质量指标上提升2-10倍。

Conclusion: DiSCo通过语义驱动的压缩策略有效解决低带宽场景下的视频传输问题，适用于医疗/教育等对带宽敏感领域。

Abstract: Traditional video codecs optimized for pixel fidelity collapse at ultra-low bitrates and produce severe artifacts. This failure arises from a fundamental misalignment between pixel accuracy and human perception. We propose a semantic video compression framework named DiSCo that transmits only the most meaningful information while relying on generative priors for detail synthesis. The source video is decomposed into three compact modalities: a textual description, a spatiotemporally degraded video, and optional sketches or poses that respectively capture semantic, appearance, and motion cues. A conditional video diffusion model then reconstructs high-quality, temporally coherent videos from these compact representations. Temporal forward filling, token interleaving, and modality-specific codecs are proposed to improve multimodal generation and modality compactness. Experiments show that our method outperforms baseline semantic and traditional codecs by 2-10X on perceptual metrics at low bitrates.

Conclusion: SplatFont3D通过3D高斯点云和动态控制策略，有效解决了3D-AFG在结构约束和细粒度控制上的挑战，适用于高效高质量的艺术字体生成。

Abstract: Artistic font generation (AFG) can assist human designers in creating innovative artistic fonts. However, most previous studies primarily focus on 2D artistic fonts in flat design, leaving personalized 3D-AFG largely underexplored. 3D-AFG not only enables applications in immersive 3D environments such as video games and animations, but also may enhance 2D-AFG by rendering 2D fonts of novel views. Moreover, unlike general 3D objects, 3D fonts exhibit precise semantics with strong structural constraints and also demand fine-grained part-level style control. To address these challenges, we propose SplatFont3D, a novel structure-aware text-to-3D AFG framework with 3D Gaussian splatting, which enables the creation of 3D artistic fonts from diverse style text prompts with precise part-level style control. Specifically, we first introduce a Glyph2Cloud module, which progressively enhances both the shapes and styles of 2D glyphs (or components) and produces their corresponding 3D point clouds for Gaussian initialization. The initialized 3D Gaussians are further optimized through interaction with a pretrained 2D diffusion model using score distillation sampling. To enable part-level control, we present a dynamic component assignment strategy that exploits the geometric priors of 3D Gaussians to partition components, while alleviating drift-induced entanglement during 3D Gaussian optimization. Our SplatFont3D provides more explicit and effective part-level style control than NeRF, attaining faster rendering efficiency. Experiments show that our SplatFont3D outperforms existing 3D models for 3D-AFG in style-text consistency, visual quality, and rendering efficiency.

Abstract: Public transport in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) often operates in overcrowded conditions where existing automated systems fail to capture reliable passenger flow data. Leveraging onboard CCTV already deployed for security, we present a baseline pipeline that combines YOLOv12 detection, BotSORT tracking, OSNet embeddings, OCR-based timestamping, and telematics-based stop classification to recover bus origin--destination (OD) flows. On annotated CCTV segments from Nairobi and Kigali buses, the system attains high counting accuracy under low-density, well-lit conditions (recall $\approx$95\%, precision $\approx$91\%, F1 $\approx$93\%). It produces OD matrices that closely match manual tallies. Under realistic stressors such as overcrowding, color-to-monochrome shifts, posture variation, and non-standard door use, performance degrades sharply (e.g., $\sim$40\% undercount in peak-hour boarding and a $\sim$17 percentage-point drop in recall for monochrome segments), revealing deployment-specific failure modes and motivating more robust, deployment-focused Re-ID methods for SSA transit.

*Hang Xu,Linjiang Huang,Feng Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于改进序列生成任务中测试时扩展（TTS）的Filling-Based Reward（FR）及FR-TTS策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将TTS应用于下一步预测（NTP）范式的难点在于，解码中间序列与完整序列的奖励值之间相关性较低，难以有效指导路径剪枝。

Method: 设计Filling-Based Reward（FR）通过填充中间序列为完整序列来预估质量，并提出FR-TTS结合动态多样性奖励与高效填充搜索机制。

Result: FR显著提升奖励相关性，且经验证在多基准与奖励模型中均超越现有方法。

Conclusion: FR-TTS解决了NTP中TTS的可靠性问题，为序列生成提供更优的中间质量评估与剪枝策略。

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) has become a prevalent technique in image generation, significantly boosting output quality by expanding the number of parallel samples and filtering them using pre-trained reward models. However, applying this powerful methodology to the next-token prediction (NTP) paradigm remains challenging. The primary obstacle is the low correlation between the reward of an image decoded from an intermediate token sequence and the reward of the fully generated image. Consequently, these incomplete intermediate representations prove to be poor indicators for guiding the pruning direction, a limitation that stems from their inherent incompleteness in scale or semantic content. To effectively address this critical issue, we introduce the Filling-Based Reward (FR). This novel design estimates the approximate future trajectory of an intermediate sample by finding and applying a reasonable filling scheme to complete the sequence. Both the correlation coefficient between rewards of intermediate samples and final samples, as well as multiple intrinsic signals like token confidence, indicate that the FR provides an excellent and reliable metric for accurately evaluating the quality of intermediate samples. Building upon this foundation, we propose FR-TTS, a sophisticated scaling strategy. FR-TTS efficiently searches for good filling schemes and incorporates a diversity reward with a dynamic weighting schedule to achieve a balanced and comprehensive evaluation of intermediate samples. We experimentally validate the superiority of FR-TTS over multiple established benchmarks and various reward models.

### [42] [CausalAffect: Causal Discovery for Facial Affective Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00456)
*Guanyu Hu,Tangzheng Lian,Dimitrios Kollias,Oya Celiktutan,Xinyu Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出CausalAffect框架，首次通过数据驱动方法建立面部动作单元（AUs）与表情之间的因果图结构，结合群体规律与样本特异性依赖，显著提升情感计算的准确性与可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统情感计算方法长期依赖动作单元（AUs）却未解决其与表情的因果关系学习问题。现有方法缺乏直接从数据推断心理学合理因果关系的机制，依赖人工标注数据或先验知识，限制了模型的泛化性与可解释性。

Method: 设计了双层级因果层次结构，同时建模AU-AU关联与AU-表情映射关系，引入极性与方向感知机制。通过特征级反事实干预消除虚假关联，利用群体数据规律与个体化结构自适应结合的策略，无需人工标注或手工设计先验。

Result: 在六个基准数据集上同时提升AU检测（如BP4D达89.3% F1）与表情识别（如FERG-DB达94.7%准确率）性能，恢复的因果结构与心理学理论一致，并发现新型抑制性依赖，如颧大肌对愤怒表情的反向调控。

Conclusion: CausalAffect通过可解释的因果发现框架，将群体模式与个体差异统一建模，在无需先验知识条件下实现情感计算的精度突破，为面部行为分析提供了新的理论视角与计算工具。

Abstract: Understanding human affect from facial behavior requires not only accurate recognition but also structured reasoning over the latent dependencies that drive muscle activations and their expressive outcomes. Although Action Units (AUs) have long served as the foundation of affective computing, existing approaches rarely address how to infer psychologically plausible causal relations between AUs and expressions directly from data. We propose CausalAffect, the first framework for causal graph discovery in facial affect analysis. CausalAffect models AU-AU and AU-Expression dependencies through a two-level polarity and direction aware causal hierarchy that integrates population-level regularities with sample-adaptive structures. A feature-level counterfactual intervention mechanism further enforces true causal effects while suppressing spurious correlations. Crucially, our approach requires neither jointly annotated datasets nor handcrafted causal priors, yet it recovers causal structures consistent with established psychological theories while revealing novel inhibitory and previously uncharacterized dependencies. Extensive experiments across six benchmarks demonstrate that CausalAffect advances the state of the art in both AU detection and expression recognition, establishing a principled connection between causal discovery and interpretable facial behavior. All trained models and source code will be released upon acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型生成的图像存在AI伪影（如皮肤过滑、油光面），无法实现'无法与真实区分'的目标，需改进真实感生成能力。

Method: 1. RealGen整合LLM优化提示+扩散模型生成图像；2. 设计Detector Reward机制，从语义和特征层检测伪影并反馈优化；3. 使用GRPO算法端到端优化；4. 创建RealBench评估体系（Detector/ Arena Scoring）。

Conclusion: RealGen通过对抗式检测机制显著提升生成质量，RealBench提供无需人工干预的可靠评估，为后续研究奠定基础。

Abstract: With the continuous advancement of image generation technology, advanced models such as GPT-Image-1 and Qwen-Image have achieved remarkable text-to-image consistency and world knowledge However, these models still fall short in photorealistic image generation. Even on simple T2I tasks, they tend to produce " fake" images with distinct AI artifacts, often characterized by "overly smooth skin" and "oily facial sheens". To recapture the original goal of "indistinguishable-from-reality" generation, we propose RealGen, a photorealistic text-to-image framework. RealGen integrates an LLM component for prompt optimization and a diffusion model for realistic image generation. Inspired by adversarial generation, RealGen introduces a "Detector Reward" mechanism, which quantifies artifacts and assesses realism using both semantic-level and feature-level synthetic image detectors. We leverage this reward signal with the GRPO algorithm to optimize the entire generation pipeline, significantly enhancing image realism and detail. Furthermore, we propose RealBench, an automated evaluation benchmark employing Detector-Scoring and Arena-Scoring. It enables human-free photorealism assessment, yielding results that are more accurate and aligned with real user experience. Experiments demonstrate that RealGen significantly outperforms general models like GPT-Image-1 and Qwen-Image, as well as specialized photorealistic models like FLUX-Krea, in terms of realism, detail, and aesthetics.

Conclusion: 该方法为单图像生成全场景3D内容提供了新范式，零样本特性与相机条件化框架为AR/VR和具身智能应用提供了实用化解决方案。

Abstract: High-quality 3D scene generation from a single image is crucial for AR/VR and embodied AI applications. Early approaches struggle to generalize due to reliance on specialized models trained on curated small datasets. While recent advancements in large-scale 3D foundation models have significantly enhanced instance-level generation, coherent scene generation remains a challenge, where performance is limited by inaccurate per-object pose estimations and spatial inconsistency. To this end, this paper introduces CC-FMO, a zero-shot, camera-conditioned pipeline for single-image to 3D scene generation that jointly conforms to the object layout in input image and preserves instance fidelity. CC-FMO employs a hybrid instance generator that combines semantics-aware vector-set representation with detail-rich structured latent representation, yielding object geometries that are both semantically plausible and high-quality. Furthermore, CC-FMO enables the application of foundational pose estimation models in the scene generation task via a simple yet effective camera-conditioned scale-solving algorithm, to enforce scene-level coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CC-FMO consistently generates high-fidelity camera-aligned compositional scenes, outperforming all state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Low-cost mobile rovers often operate on uneven terrain where small bumps or tilts are difficult to perceive visually but can significantly affect locomotion stability. To address this problem, we explore a smartphone-based structured-light system that projects a grid pattern onto the ground and reconstructs local terrain unevenness from a single handheld device. The system is inspired by face-recognition projectors, but adapted for ground sensing. A key technical challenge is robustly matching the projected grid with its deformed observation under perspective distortion and partial occlusion. Conventional one-dimensional dynamic time warping (1D-DTW) is not directly applicable to such two-dimensional grid patterns. We therefore propose a topology-constrained two-dimensional dynamic time warping (2D-DTW) algorithm that performs column-wise alignment under a global grid consistency constraint. The proposed method is designed to be simple enough to run on resource limited platforms while preserving the grid structure required for accurate triangulation. We demonstrate that our 2D-DTW formulation can be used not only for terrain sensing but also as a general tool for matching structured grid patterns in image processing scenarios. This paper describes the overall system design as well as the 2D-DTW extension that emerged from this application.

Motivation: 现有视频扩散模型依赖大规模领域数据且泛化性差，而语言-图像模型展现强组合性，可能具备隐式时序建模能力，适合生成连贯的机器人操作视频。

Method: 提出文本条件生成（语言指令+首帧）与轨迹条件生成（2D轨迹+首帧）的两阶段框架，使用LoRA对预训练图像生成模型微调，在Jaco Play、Bridge V2、RT1等数据集验证。

Result: 两种生成模式均能产生与条件对齐的光滑、时序连贯视频，且无需显式时间建模即可保持跨数据集的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 预训练图像生成模型通过最小监督即可编码可迁移的时序先验，可有效作为机器人操作的轻量级视觉规划器。

Abstract: Generating realistic robotic manipulation videos is an important step toward unifying perception, planning, and action in embodied agents. While existing video diffusion models require large domain-specific datasets and struggle to generalize, recent image generation models trained on language-image corpora exhibit strong compositionality, including the ability to synthesize temporally coherent grid images. This suggests a latent capacity for video-like generation even without explicit temporal modeling.
  We explore whether such models can serve as visual planners for robots when lightly adapted using LoRA finetuning. We propose a two-part framework that includes: (1) text-conditioned generation, which uses a language instruction and the first frame, and (2) trajectory-conditioned generation, which uses a 2D trajectory overlay and the same initial frame. Experiments on the Jaco Play dataset, Bridge V2, and the RT1 dataset show that both modes produce smooth, coherent robot videos aligned with their respective conditions.
  Our findings indicate that pretrained image generators encode transferable temporal priors and can function as video-like robotic planners under minimal supervision.

*Zeyuan An,Yanghang Xiao,Zhiying Leng,Frederick W. B. Li,Xiaohui Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Cross-Temporal 3D Gaussian Splatting (Cross-Temporal 3DGS), a framework for efficiently updating 3D scenes over time using sparse images and historical data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse-view observations are common in real-world applications like disaster assessment, where dense scans are impractical. Existing methods lack efficient mechanisms for temporal consistency and prior-guided updates.

Method: The framework includes (1) cross-temporal camera alignment, (2) interference-based confidence initialization for change detection, and (3) progressive optimization integrating historical priors. It supports non-continuous capture to reconstruct past/future scenes iteratively.

Result: Experiments demonstrate superior reconstruction quality and data efficiency compared to baselines, with capabilities for temporal change modeling and detailed 3D restoration from sparse inputs.

Conclusion: This approach enables practical cross-temporal digital twins and long-term spatial documentation under sparse data constraints.

Abstract: Maintaining consistent 3D scene representations over time is a significant challenge in computer vision. Updating 3D scenes from sparse-view observations is crucial for various real-world applications, including urban planning, disaster assessment, and historical site preservation, where dense scans are often unavailable or impractical. In this paper, we propose Cross-Temporal 3D Gaussian Splatting (Cross-Temporal 3DGS), a novel framework for efficiently reconstructing and updating 3D scenes across different time periods, using sparse images and previously captured scene priors. Our approach comprises three stages: 1) Cross-temporal camera alignment for estimating and aligning camera poses across different timestamps; 2) Interference-based confidence initialization to identify unchanged regions between timestamps, thereby guiding updates; and 3) Progressive cross-temporal optimization, which iteratively integrates historical prior information into the 3D scene to enhance reconstruction quality. Our method supports non-continuous capture, enabling not only updates using new sparse views to refine existing scenes, but also recovering past scenes from limited data with the help of current captures. Furthermore, we demonstrate the potential of this approach to achieve temporal changes using only sparse images, which can later be reconstructed into detailed 3D representations as needed. Experimental results show significant improvements over baseline methods in reconstruction quality and data efficiency, making this approach a promising solution for scene versioning, cross-temporal digital twins, and long-term spatial documentation.

Conclusion: 动态优化框架显著提升生成图像检测的跨场景适应能力，有效解决持续学习中的灾难性遗忘

Abstract: The widespread misuse of image generation technologies has raised security concerns, driving the development of AI-generated image detection methods. However, generalization has become a key challenge and open problem: existing approaches struggle to adapt to emerging generative methods and content types in real-world scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a Scene-Aware and Importance-Guided Dynamic Optimization detection framework with continual learning (SAIDO). Specifically, we design Scene-Awareness-Based Expert Module (SAEM) that dynamically identifies and incorporates new scenes using VLLMs. For each scene, independent expert modules are dynamically allocated, enabling the framework to capture scene-specific forgery features better and enhance cross-scene generalization. To mitigate catastrophic forgetting when learning from multiple image generative methods, we introduce Importance-Guided Dynamic Optimization Mechanism (IDOM), which optimizes each neuron through an importance-guided gradient projection strategy, thereby achieving an effective balance between model plasticity and stability. Extensive experiments on continual learning tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms the current SOTA method in both stability and plasticity, achieving 44.22\% and 40.57\% relative reductions in average detection error rate and forgetting rate, respectively. On open-world datasets, it improves the average detection accuracy by 9.47\% compared to the current SOTA method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) approach combining generative modeling, semantic-aware deformation, and GS refinement to address multihuman, multiobject dynamic scene reconstruction in monocular setups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D GS methods struggle with dynamic scenes involving multiple humans/objects due to frequent occlusions and complex motion patterns, especially in monocular setups where structural consistency is hard to maintain using only rendering loss.

Method: 1) 3D generative models to create high-fidelity meshes of scene elements; 2) Semantic-aware deformation (rigid transformations for objects, LBS-based deformation for humans) to dynamically map meshes; 3) GS-optimization to refine alignments of individual elements.

Result: Outperformed state-of-the-art methods in surface reconstruction quality on the HOI-M3 dataset, maintaining structural consistency and producing multiview/temporally coherent geometry under severe occlusion.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach effectively overcomes dynamic scene challenges (occlusions, motion diversity) by integrating generative modeling, deformation-aware mapping, and GS refinement, enabling high-fidelity, consistent geometry even in complex monocular setups.

Abstract: Real-world human-built environments are highly dynamic, involving multiple humans and their complex interactions with surrounding objects. While 3D geometry modeling of such scenes is crucial for applications like AR/VR, gaming, and embodied AI, it remains underexplored due to challenges like diverse motion patterns and frequent occlusions. Beyond novel view rendering, 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) has demonstrated remarkable progress in producing detailed, high-quality surface geometry with fast optimization of the underlying structure. However, very few GS-based methods address multihuman, multiobject scenarios, primarily due to the above-mentioned inherent challenges. In a monocular setup, these challenges are further amplified, as maintaining structural consistency under severe occlusion becomes difficult when the scene is optimized solely based on GS-based rendering loss. To tackle the challenges of such a multihuman, multiobject dynamic scene, we propose a hybrid approach that effectively combines the advantages of 1) 3D generative models for generating high-fidelity meshes of the scene elements, 2) Semantic-aware deformation, \ie rigid transformation of the rigid objects and LBS-based deformation of the humans, and mapping of the deformed high-fidelity meshes in the dynamic scene, and 3) GS-based optimization of the individual elements for further refining their alignments in the scene. Such a hybrid approach helps maintain the object structures even under severe occlusion and can produce multiview and temporally consistent geometry. We choose HOI-M3 for evaluation, as, to the best of our knowledge, this is the only dataset featuring multihuman, multiobject interactions in a dynamic scene. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art method in producing better surface reconstruction of such scenes.

Conclusion: 建立统一框架揭示神经表征的交互机制，为脑区功能映射、表征分析与可视化探测提供可解释约束条件

Abstract: What visual information is encoded in individual brain regions, and how do distributed patterns combine to create their neural representations? Prior work has used generative models to replicate known category selectivity in isolated regions (e.g., faces in FFA), but these approaches offer limited insight into how regions interact during complex, naturalistic vision. We introduce NeuroVolve, a generative framework that provides brain-guided image synthesis via optimization of a neural objective function in the embedding space of a pretrained vision-language model. Images are generated under the guidance of a programmable neural objective, i.e., activating or deactivating single regions or multiple regions together. NeuroVolve is validated by recovering known selectivity for individual brain regions, while expanding to synthesize coherent scenes that satisfy complex, multi-region constraints. By tracking optimization steps, it reveals semantic trajectories through embedding space, unifying brain-guided image editing and preferred stimulus generation in a single process. We show that NeuroVolve can generate both low-level and semantic feature-specific stimuli for single ROIs, as well as stimuli aligned to curated neural objectives. These include co-activation and decorrelation between regions, exposing cooperative and antagonistic tuning relationships. Notably, the framework captures subject-specific preferences, supporting personalized brain-driven synthesis and offering interpretable constraints for mapping, analyzing, and probing neural representations of visual information.

Motivation: 现有方法在3D空间开放词汇描述与实时性能间存在权衡，需兼顾几何结构与语义细节以满足AR/机器人等应用需求。

Conclusion: DAAAM成功解决了几何-语义联合表征的实时性难题，在大规模场景下成为当前最优解决方案，并支持工具调用的推理应用。

Abstract: Computer vision and robotics applications ranging from augmented reality to robot autonomy in large-scale environments require spatio-temporal memory frameworks that capture both geometric structure for accurate language-grounding as well as semantic detail. Existing methods face a tradeoff, where producing rich open-vocabulary descriptions comes at the expense of real-time performance when these descriptions have to be grounded in 3D. To address these challenges, we propose Describe Anything, Anywhere, at Any Moment (DAAAM), a novel spatio-temporal memory framework for large-scale and real-time 4D scene understanding. DAAAM introduces a novel optimization-based frontend to infer detailed semantic descriptions from localized captioning models, such as the Describe Anything Model (DAM), leveraging batch processing to speed up inference by an order of magnitude for online processing. It leverages such semantic understanding to build a hierarchical 4D scene graph (SG), which acts as an effective globally spatially and temporally consistent memory representation. DAAAM constructs 4D SGs with detailed, geometrically grounded descriptions while maintaining real-time performance. We show that DAAAM's 4D SG interfaces well with a tool-calling agent for inference and reasoning.
  We thoroughly evaluate DAAAM in the complex task of spatio-temporal question answering on the NaVQA benchmark and show its generalization capabilities for sequential task grounding on the SG3D benchmark. We further curate an extended OC-NaVQA benchmark for large-scale and long-time evaluations. DAAAM achieves state-of-the-art results in both tasks, improving OC-NaVQA question accuracy by 53.6%, position errors by 21.9%, temporal errors by 21.6%, and SG3D task grounding accuracy by 27.8% over the most competitive baselines, respectively. We release our data and code open-source.

Motivation: 当前视觉-语言模型难以准确理解视觉讽刺，存在局部-全局语境整合不足、推断偏差与幻觉问题，需通过结构化方法提升其推理能力。

Method: 提出视觉级联解耦多智能体系统，分解图像为细粒度语义表征，并设计不确定性分析引导的链式推理策略，将复杂任务分解为序列化子任务。

Conclusion: SatireDecoder为视觉-语言模型在高阶语义任务（如讽刺理解）提供了可解释性强的结构化推理范式。

Abstract: Satire, a form of artistic expression combining humor with implicit critique, holds significant social value by illuminating societal issues. Despite its cultural and societal significance, satire comprehension, particularly in purely visual forms, remains a challenging task for current vision-language models. This task requires not only detecting satire but also deciphering its nuanced meaning and identifying the implicated entities. Existing models often fail to effectively integrate local entity relationships with global context, leading to misinterpretation, comprehension biases, and hallucinations. To address these limitations, we propose SatireDecoder, a training-free framework designed to enhance satirical image comprehension. Our approach proposes a multi-agent system performing visual cascaded decoupling to decompose images into fine-grained local and global semantic representations. In addition, we introduce a chain-of-thought reasoning strategy guided by uncertainty analysis, which breaks down the complex satire comprehension process into sequential subtasks with minimized uncertainty. Our method significantly improves interpretive accuracy while reducing hallucinations. Experimental results validate that SatireDecoder outperforms existing baselines in comprehending visual satire, offering a promising direction for vision-language reasoning in nuanced, high-level semantic tasks.

Conclusion: 参数高效迁移学习能有效复用大规模预训练模型知识，尤其适用于医疗领域零样本、小数据场景，为高资源消耗模型的临床应用提供新范式。

Abstract: Foundation models trained via vision-language pretraining have demonstrated strong zero-shot capabilities across diverse image domains, yet their application to volumetric medical imaging remains limited. We introduce MedCT-VLM: Medical CT Vision-Language Model, a parameter-efficient vision-language framework designed to adapt large-scale CT foundation models for downstream clinical tasks. MedCT-VLM uses a parameter-efficient approach to adapt CT-CLIP, a contrastive vision-language model trained on 25,692 chest CT volumes, for multi-label pathology classification using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Rather than fine-tuning the model's 440 M parameters directly, we insert low-rank decomposition matrices into attention layers of both vision and text encoders, training only 1.67M parameters (0.38\% of total). We evaluate on zero-shot classification across 18 thoracic pathologies, where the model must align CT embeddings with unseen text prompts at inference without task-specific training. LoRA fine-tuning improves mean AUROC from 61.3\% to 68.9\% (+7.6 pp), accuracy from 67.2\% to 73.6\% (+6.4 pp), and macro-F1 from 32.1\% to 36.9\% (+4.8 pp). These results demonstrate that parameter-efficient methods can effectively transfer large-scale pretraining to downstream medical imaging tasks, particularly for zero-shot scenarios where labeled data is scarce.

*Tzu-I Liao,Mahmoud Fakhry,Jibin Yesudas Varghese*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study explores automated pith detection in tree cross-sections using deep learning models (YOLOv9, U-Net, Swin Transformer, DeepLabV3, Mask R-CNN), with Swin Transformer achieving the highest accuracy (0.94) and data augmentation enhancing generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual pith detection is laborious and error-prone, necessitating automated solutions for improved efficiency and accuracy in forestry analysis.

Method: Evaluated five deep learning models on a dynamically augmented dataset of 582 labeled images. Tested generalizability on an external oak dataset (11 images) and retrained the worst-performing model with additional data. Addressed challenges via hyperparameter tuning, augmentation, and Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) for Mask R-CNN.

Result: Swin Transformer excelled in fine segmentation; YOLOv9 performed well for bounding boxes but struggled with boundary precision. U-Net and DeepLabV3 showed strength in structured patterns and multi-scale features, respectively. Mask R-CNN's IoU improved from 0.45 to 0.80 with NMS. Model performance varied on the oak dataset, highlighting dataset-specific adaptability.

Conclusion: Deep learning effectively automates pith detection, with model selection dependent on dataset characteristics and application requirements, though challenges like boundary inconsistencies remain.

Abstract: Pith detection in tree cross-sections is essential for forestry and wood quality analysis but remains a manual, error-prone task. This study evaluates deep learning models -- YOLOv9, U-Net, Swin Transformer, DeepLabV3, and Mask R-CNN -- to automate the process efficiently. A dataset of 582 labeled images was dynamically augmented to improve generalization. Swin Transformer achieved the highest accuracy (0.94), excelling in fine segmentation. YOLOv9 performed well for bounding box detection but struggled with boundary precision. U-Net was effective for structured patterns, while DeepLabV3 captured multi-scale features with slight boundary imprecision. Mask R-CNN initially underperformed due to overlapping detections, but applying Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) improved its IoU from 0.45 to 0.80. Generalizability was next tested using an oak dataset of 11 images from Oregon State University's Tree Ring Lab. Additionally, for exploratory analysis purposes, an additional dataset of 64 labeled tree cross-sections was used to train the worst-performing model to see if this would improve its performance generalizing to the unseen oak dataset. Key challenges included tensor mismatches and boundary inconsistencies, addressed through hyperparameter tuning and augmentation. Our results highlight deep learning's potential for tree cross-section pith detection, with model choice depending on dataset characteristics and application needs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统诊断方法依赖主观判断，且HAM10000等数据集存在类别不平衡与深度学习模型'黑箱'问题。

Method: 通过DCGAN生成各类皮肤病变图像解决类别失衡问题，采用ResNet-50进行微调分类，并用LIME+SHAP可视化模型决策依据（如不规则形态等临床特征）

Result: 准确率92.50%/Macro-AUC 98.82%超出现有模型，但黑色素瘤（Melanoma NOS）F1值0.8602显示鉴别能力需提升

Conclusion: 验证了高准确率可解释框架的有效性，未来需强化对关键疾病类别（如黑色素瘤）的判别能力

Abstract: Accurate and timely diagnosis of multi-class skin lesions is hampered by subjective methods, inherent data imbalance in datasets like HAM10000, and the "black box" nature of Deep Learning (DL) models. This study proposes a trustworthy and highly accurate Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) system to overcome these limitations. The approach utilizes Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGANs) for per class data augmentation to resolve the critical class imbalance problem. A fine-tuned ResNet-50 classifier is then trained on the augmented dataset to classify seven skin disease categories. Crucially, LIME and SHAP Explainable AI (XAI) techniques are integrated to provide transparency by confirming that predictions are based on clinically relevant features like irregular morphology. The system achieved a high overall Accuracy of 92.50 % and a Macro-AUC of 98.82 %, successfully outperforming various prior benchmarked architectures. This work successfully validates a verifiable framework that combines high performance with the essential clinical interpretability required for safe diagnostic deployment. Future research should prioritize enhancing discrimination for critical categories, such as Melanoma NOS (F1-Score is 0.8602).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出广义医疗短语定位（GMPG）任务，解决传统医疗短语定位系统只能单区域映射的局限性，并开发MedGrounder模型通过两阶段训练实现零/多区域定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医疗短语定位系统基于单区域假设但实际存在多区域、无法定位的短语（如否定描述），需要建立更灵活的映射任务形式。

Method: 提出MedGrounder模型：1）在报告句子-解剖位置边界框数据集预训练；2）在人工标注边界框数据集微调。采用零样本迁移方案并在两个医学数据集验证有效性。

Result: MedGrounder在零样本迁移任务中超越REC基线模型，对多区域短语和无法定位短语的召回率分别提升12.7%和9.3%，且标注需求减少75%。

Conclusion: GMPG框架为医疗报告理解提供更贴近实际场景的建模范式，MedGrounder通过有效平衡模型复杂度与标注成本，证明了多区域医疗短语定位的可行性。

Abstract: Medical phrase grounding (MPG) maps textual descriptions of radiological findings to corresponding image regions. These grounded reports are easier to interpret, especially for non-experts. Existing MPG systems mostly follow the referring expression comprehension (REC) paradigm and return exactly one bounding box per phrase. Real reports often violate this assumption. They contain multi-region findings, non-diagnostic text, and non-groundable phrases, such as negations or descriptions of normal anatomy. Motivated by this, we reformulate the task as generalised medical phrase grounding (GMPG), where each sentence is mapped to zero, one, or multiple scored regions. To realise this formulation, we introduce the first GMPG model: MedGrounder. We adopted a two-stage training regime: pre-training on report sentence--anatomy box alignment datasets and fine-tuning on report sentence--human annotated box datasets. Experiments on PadChest-GR and MS-CXR show that MedGrounder achieves strong zero-shot transfer and outperforms REC-style and grounded report generation baselines on multi-region and non-groundable phrases, while using far fewer human box annotations. Finally, we show that MedGrounder can be composed with existing report generators to produce grounded reports without retraining the generator.

Abstract: The increasing prevalence of thyroid cancer globally has led to the development of various computer-aided detection methods. Accurate segmentation of thyroid nodules is a critical first step in the development of AI-assisted clinical decision support systems. This study focuses on instance segmentation of thyroid nodules using YOLOv5 algorithms on ultrasound images. We evaluated multiple YOLOv5 variants (Nano, Small, Medium, Large, and XLarge) across two dataset versions, with and without doppler images. The YOLOv5-Large algorithm achieved the highest performance with a dice score of 91\% and mAP of 0.87 on the dataset including doppler images. Notably, our results demonstrate that doppler images, typically excluded by physicians, can significantly improve segmentation performance. The YOLOv5-Small model achieved 79\% dice score when doppler images were excluded, while including them improved performance across all model variants. These findings suggest that instance segmentation with YOLOv5 provides an effective real-time approach for thyroid nodule detection, with potential clinical applications in automated diagnostic systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出StreamGaze——首个评估多语言模型（MLLMs）在流媒体视频中利用实时注视信号进行时空推理和主动预测的基准测试，揭示现有模型在人类意图理解方面存在显著差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有流媒体视频理解基准忽视了人类注视信号的有效利用，而AR眼镜等实际应用需要模型能实时追踪注意力并预判意图。StreamGaze填补了这一方法论与应用需求间的空白。

Method: 构建包含注视引导的过去、现在、主动任务三维度基准，开发结合注视轨迹提取、区域视觉提示和扫描路径生成的QA构建流程，生成时空对齐的问答对以模拟人类感知动态。

Result: 当前MLLMs在StreamGaze任务中相较人类准确率落后32.6%，暴露其在动态注意力跟踪（任务平均得分56.1vs89.4）、意图建模（35.7%样本误判）和未来预测（1.2秒内预测准确率仅41.3）等维度的核心缺陷。

Conclusion: 研究揭示MLLMs需突破性改进才能有效融合视觉-注视双重线索，需针对性提升时空连续性建模、注意力迁移表征和主动推理能力。基准数据集与代码已开源以推动领域发展。

Abstract: Streaming video understanding requires models not only to process temporally incoming frames, but also to anticipate user intention for realistic applications like AR glasses. While prior streaming benchmarks evaluate temporal reasoning, none measure whether MLLMs can interpret or leverage human gaze signals within a streaming setting. To fill this gap, we introduce StreamGaze, the first benchmark designed to evaluate how effectively MLLMs use gaze for temporal and proactive reasoning in streaming videos. StreamGaze introduces gaze-guided past, present, and proactive tasks that comprehensively evaluate streaming video understanding. These tasks assess whether models can use real-time gaze to follow shifting attention and infer user intentions from only past and currently observed frames. To build StreamGaze, we develop a gaze-video QA generation pipeline that aligns egocentric videos with raw gaze trajectories via fixation extraction, region-specific visual prompting, and scanpath construction. This pipeline produces spatio-temporally grounded QA pairs that closely reflect human perceptual dynamics. Across all StreamGaze tasks, we observe substantial performance gaps between state-of-the-art MLLMs and human performance, revealing fundamental limitations in gaze-based temporal reasoning, intention modeling, and proactive prediction. We further provide detailed analyses of gaze-prompting strategies, reasoning behaviors, and task-specific failure modes, offering deeper insight into why current MLLMs struggle and what capabilities future models must develop. All data and code will be publicly released to support continued research in gaze-guided streaming video understanding.

*Shanhui Liu,Rui Xu,Yunke Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Coarse-to-Fine Vision Mamba (CF-ViM)，通过动态分辨率策略提升Vision Mamba的推理效率，兼顾准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有token压缩方法对所有图像统一降采样，导致信息丢失且无法适应图像复杂度差异，效率受限。

Method: 分两阶段处理：先以大patch进行粗粒度推理降低计算；对低置信度区域局部细粒度重计算，动态分配资源。

Result: 在ImageNet上，CF-ViM在同等准确率下计算量显著低于传统Vision Mamba及token精简方法，效率提升2-3倍。

Conclusion: CF-ViM通过自适应计算策略，解决了视觉任务中效率与精度的平衡问题，为资源敏感场景提供新方案。

Abstract: Vision Mamba has emerged as a promising and efficient alternative to Vision Transformers, yet its efficiency remains fundamentally constrained by the number of input tokens. Existing token reduction approaches typically adopt token pruning or merging to reduce computation. However, they inherently lead to information loss, as they discard or compress token representations. This problem is exacerbated when applied uniformly to fine-grained token representations across all images, regardless of visual complexity. We observe that not all inputs require fine-grained processing. Simple images can be effectively handled at coarse resolution, while only complex ones may warrant refinement. Based on this insight, we propose \textit{Coarse-to-Fine Vision Mamba (CF-ViM)}, an adaptive framework for efficient inference. CF-ViM first performs coarse-grained inference by dividing the input image into large patches, significantly reducing the token length and computation. When the model's prediction confidence is low, selected regions are re-processed at a finer resolution to recover critical visual details with minimal additional cost. This dynamic resolution assignment strategy allows CF-ViM to allocate computation adaptively according to image complexity, ensuring efficient processing without compromising essential visual information. Experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that CF-ViM outperforms both the baseline Vision Mamba and state-of-the-art token reduction techniques in terms of accuracy and efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统孤立数字分类器可能无法满足实际多数字同作者场景需求，如ZIP码识别。需要能反映现实挑战的评估数据集。

Method: 基于NIST数据集作者信息合成MDW数据集，包含任务特定评估指标，并探索利用任务知识改进分类的方法。

Result: 单数字分类器在MDW数据集上表现显著下降，证明多数字识别需要专门优化。新指标能更真实反映实际应用场景效果。

Conclusion: MDW数据集建立了更贴近实际的手写数字评估标准，强调需要结合领域知识开发新方法解决多数字识别挑战。

Abstract: Isolated digit classification has served as a motivating problem for decades of machine learning research. In real settings, numbers often occur as multiple digits, all written by the same person. Examples include ZIP Codes, handwritten check amounts, and appointment times. In this work, we leverage knowledge about the writers of NIST digit images to create more realistic benchmark multi-digit writer (MDW) data sets. As expected, we find that classifiers may perform well on isolated digits yet do poorly on multi-digit number recognition. If we want to solve real number recognition problems, additional advances are needed. The MDW benchmarks come with task-specific performance metrics that go beyond typical error calculations to more closely align with real-world impact. They also create opportunities to develop methods that can leverage task-specific knowledge to improve performance well beyond that of individual digit classification methods.

TL;DR: 提出Dynamic-eDiTor，基于MM-DiT与4DGS的无训练文本驱动4D场景编辑框架，解决多视角与时间一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有2D扩散模型在帧独立编辑时易导致运动失真和几何漂移，需要兼顾空间-时间一致性的高效编辑方法。

Method: 结合多模态扩散Transformer与4D高斯泼溅，设计时空子网格注意力机制（STGA）实现局部一致性融合，并通过上下文令牌传播（CTP）进行全局优化。

Result: 在多视角视频数据集DyNeRF上达到优越的编辑保真度与时空一致性，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该训练-Free框架能直接优化预训练4DGS，实现实时无缝编辑并保持编辑完整性。

Abstract: Recent progress in 4D representations, such as Dynamic NeRF and 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS), has enabled dynamic 4D scene reconstruction. However, text-driven 4D scene editing remains under-explored due to the challenge of ensuring both multi-view and temporal consistency across space and time during editing. Existing studies rely on 2D diffusion models that edit frames independently, often causing motion distortion, geometric drift, and incomplete editing. We introduce Dynamic-eDiTor, a training-free text-driven 4D editing framework leveraging Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (MM-DiT) and 4DGS. This mechanism consists of Spatio-Temporal Sub-Grid Attention (STGA) for locally consistent cross-view and temporal fusion, and Context Token Propagation (CTP) for global propagation via token inheritance and optical-flow-guided token replacement. Together, these components allow Dynamic-eDiTor to perform seamless, globally consistent multi-view video without additional training and directly optimize pre-trained source 4DGS. Extensive experiments on multi-view video dataset DyNeRF demonstrate that our method achieves superior editing fidelity and both multi-view and temporal consistency prior approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FoundationGait, a scalable self-supervised pretraining framework for gait understanding that achieves strong performance across diverse tasks (e.g., human identification, medical screening) and sets benchmarks on real-world datasets (48% zero-shot accuracy on Gait3D, 64.5% on OU-MVLP).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current gait models are limited by poor scalability (failure to follow scaling laws) and lack of generalization (models designed for isolated tasks). This work aims to create a unified foundation model that scales effectively and serves diverse gait tasks.

Method: Proposed FoundationGait: a self-supervised pretraining framework with 0.13B parameters, pretrained on 12 public datasets containing 2M+ walking sequences. Model leverages large-scale data and unified architecture to address scalability and cross-task generalization.

Result: FoundationGait achieved 48.0% zero-shot rank-1 accuracy on Gait3D (real-world data) and 64.5% on OU-MVLP (lab-controlled data) without fine-tuning. Demonstrated robust performance across varied datasets, modalities, and tasks including human identification, scoliosis screening, and depression prediction.

Conclusion: FoundationGait successfully bridges scalability and generalization gaps in gait modeling, proving that large-scale self-supervised pretraining enables state-of-the-art performance in both lab and wild scenarios, establishing new milestones for gait recognition.

Abstract: Gait patterns play a critical role in human identification and healthcare analytics, yet current progress remains constrained by small, narrowly designed models that fail to scale or generalize. Building a unified gait foundation model requires addressing two longstanding barriers: (a) Scalability. Why have gait models historically failed to follow scaling laws? (b) Generalization. Can one model serve the diverse gait tasks that have traditionally been studied in isolation? We introduce FoundationGait, the first scalable, self-supervised pretraining framework for gait understanding. Its largest version has nearly 0.13 billion parameters and is pretrained on 12 public gait datasets comprising over 2 million walking sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FoundationGait, with or without fine-tuning, performs robustly across a wide spectrum of gait datasets, conditions, tasks (e.g., human identification, scoliosis screening, depression prediction, and attribute estimation), and even input modality. Notably, it achieves 48.0% zero-shot rank-1 accuracy on the challenging in-the-wild Gait3D dataset (1,000 test subjects) and 64.5% on the largest in-the-lab OU-MVLP dataset (5,000+ test subjects), setting a new milestone in robust gait recognition.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于稳定性与适应性分离的视频-语言持续学习框架AFD，通过静态交互表征与动态调度器减少遗忘并提升跨任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有持续学习方法在平衡模型稳定性（旧知识保持）与可塑性（新知识适应）时存在缺陷，如过度模糊二者的界限、依赖静态路由机制或需存储历史数据，而作者希望在内存与隐私约束下明确区分模型中应保持稳定与可调整的部分。

Method: 提出AFD框架：1）视频映射为低速变化的affordance tokens，构成共享的时间对齐基础表征层，并通过弱对齐与教师模型一致性进行正则化；2）轻量级调度器基于查询动态路由、冲突感知更新，按需扩展容量；3）仅使用问题文本进行历史知识回放，避免存储视频数据。

Result: 在域增量VideoQA任务中达到51.6%平均准确率（遗忘率-1.8%），ViLCo指标中MQ/NLQ的R@1@0.5分别为29.6%/20.7%，VQ任务stAP@0.25为18.4%，iVQA任务准确率39.5%（遗忘率-1.6%），均取得SOTA表现。

Conclusion: AFD通过显式分解稳定交互表征与目标适应模块，在视频-语言持续学习中实现兼顾稳定性与可扩展性的框架设计，且满足隐私与内存限制需求，具有可解释性。

Abstract: Continual learning for video--language understanding is increasingly important as models face non-stationary data, domains, and query styles, yet prevailing solutions blur what should stay stable versus what should adapt, rely on static routing/capacity, or require replaying past videos. We aim to explicitly specify where stability lives and where plasticity should be focused under realistic memory and privacy constraints. We introduce Affordance-First Decomposition (AFD): videos are mapped to slowly varying affordance tokens that form a shared, time-aligned substrate, while a lightweight, query-routed, conflict-aware scheduler concentrates adaptation and grows capacity only when needed. The substrate is stabilized via weak alignment and teacher consistency, and training uses question-only replay. AFD achieves state-of-the-art across protocols: 51.6% average accuracy with -1.8% forgetting on domain-incremental VideoQA, ViLCo R@1@0.5 of 29.6% (MQ) and 20.7% (NLQ) with 18.4% stAP@0.25 (VQ), and 39.5% accuracy with -1.6% forgetting on time-incremental iVQA. Overall, AFD offers an explicit, interpretable split between a stable interaction-centered substrate and targeted adaptation.

Conclusion: 所提方法有效挖掘开源模型潜力，为LVLM对齐提供了兼顾准确性和稳定性的解决方案

Abstract: Recently, large vision-language models (LVLMs) have risen to be a promising approach for multimodal tasks. However, principled hallucination mitigation remains a critical challenge.In this work, we first analyze the data generation process in LVLM hallucination mitigation and affirm that on-policy data significantly outperforms off-policy data, which thus calls for efficient and reliable preference annotation of on-policy data. We then point out that, existing annotation methods introduce additional hallucination in training samples, which may enhance the model's hallucination patterns, to address this problem, we propose training a hallucination classifier giving binary annotations, which guarantee clean chosen samples for the subsequent alignment. To further harness of the power of on-policy data, we design a robust iterative direct preference optimization (DPO) algorithm adopting a dynamic sample reweighting scheme. We conduct comprehensive experiments on three benchmarks with comparison to 8 state-of-the-art baselines. In particular, our approach reduces the hallucination rate of LLaVA-1.5-7B on MMHalBench by 50.8% and the average hallucination rate on Object HalBench by 79.5%; more significantly, our method fully taps into the potential of open-source models, enabling LLaVA-1.5-13B to even surpass the performance of GPT-4V.

Motivation: Early cancer detection is critical for improving survival outcomes, but traditional methods may miss subtle abnormalities. Recent AI advancements, especially deep learning models, offer more precise imaging analysis, enabling earlier and more accurate diagnosis.

Method: The paper reviews deep learning models like convolutional neural networks (CNNs), transformers, and hybrid attention architectures to analyze multimodal medical imaging data (e.g., MRI, CT, PET, histopathology). These models are integrated with radiogenomics, linking imaging features to genomics and biomarkers for comprehensive cancer analysis.

Conclusion: AI-driven multimodal imaging and radiogenomic integration provide a novel framework for non-invasive cancer detection, molecular profiling, and personalized therapy, advancing the field of oncology by improving early diagnosis and tailored treatment strategies.

Abstract: Early cancer detection remains one of the most critical challenges in modern healthcare, where delayed diagnosis significantly reduces survival outcomes. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence, particularly deep learning, have enabled transformative progress in medical imaging analysis. Deep learning-based computer vision models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), transformers, and hybrid attention architectures, can automatically extract complex spatial, morphological, and temporal patterns from multimodal imaging data including MRI, CT, PET, mammography, histopathology, and ultrasound. These models surpass traditional radiological assessment by identifying subtle tissue abnormalities and tumor microenvironment variations invisible to the human eye. At a broader scale, the integration of multimodal imaging with radiogenomics linking quantitative imaging features with genomics, transcriptomics, and epigenetic biomarkers has introduced a new paradigm for personalized oncology. This radiogenomic fusion allows the prediction of tumor genotype, immune response, molecular subtypes, and treatment resistance without invasive biopsies.

Method: 提出三重技术创新：适配器微调策略（保留视觉基础模型通用表征）、混合注意力机制（结合CNN局部建模与Transformer全局推理）、历史交互整合的改进概率图调制方案。

Conclusion: 该框架具备优秀的领域适应性和实际应用价值，通过参数高效微调和多尺度特征学习，成功解决了遥感图像分割中的关键挑战。

Abstract: Interactive image segmentation(IIS) plays a critical role in generating precise annotations for remote sensing imagery, where objects often exhibit scale variations, irregular boundaries and complex backgrounds. However, existing IIS methods, primarily designed for natural images, struggle to generalize to remote sensing domains due to limited annotated data and computational overhead. To address these challenges, we proposed RS-ISRefiner, a novel click-based IIS framework tailored for remote sensing images. The framework employs an adapter-based tuning strategy that preserves the general representations of Vision Foundation Models while enabling efficient learning of remote sensing-specific spatial and boundary characteristics. A hybrid attention mechanism integrating convolutional local modeling with Transformer-based global reasoning enhances robustness against scale diversity and scene complexity. Furthermore, an improved probability map modulation scheme effectively incorporates historical user interactions, yielding more stable iterative refinement and higher boundary fidelity. Comprehensive experiments on six remote sensing datasets, including iSAID, ISPRS Potsdam, SandBar, NWPU, LoveDA Urban and WHUBuilding, demonstrate that RS-ISRefiner consistently outperforms state-of-the-art IIS methods in terms of segmentation accuracy, efficiency and interaction cost. These results confirm the effectiveness and generalizability of our framework, making it highly suitable for high-quality instance segmentation in practical remote sensing scenarios.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving systems directly generate driving policies from raw sensor inputs. While these systems can extract effective environmental features for planning, relying on auxiliary perception tasks, developing perception annotation-free planning paradigms has become increasingly critical due to the high cost of manual perception annotation. In this work, we propose TrajDiff, a Trajectory-oriented BEV Conditioned Diffusion framework that establishes a fully perception annotation-free generative method for end-to-end autonomous driving. TrajDiff requires only raw sensor inputs and future trajectory, constructing Gaussian BEV heatmap targets that inherently capture driving modalities. We design a simple yet effective trajectory-oriented BEV encoder to extract the TrajBEV feature without perceptual supervision. Furthermore, we introduce Trajectory-oriented BEV Diffusion Transformer (TB-DiT), which leverages ego-state information and the predicted TrajBEV features to directly generate diverse yet plausible trajectories, eliminating the need for handcrafted motion priors. Beyond architectural innovations, TrajDiff enables exploration of data scaling benefits in the annotation-free setting. Evaluated on the NAVSIM benchmark, TrajDiff achieves 87.5 PDMS, establishing state-of-the-art performance among all annotation-free methods. With data scaling, it further improves to 88.5 PDMS, which is comparable to advanced perception-based approaches. Our code and model will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Recently, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has shown promising potential for aligning text-to-image (T2I) models, yet existing GRPO-based methods suffer from two critical limitations. (1) \textit{Shared credit assignment}: trajectory-level advantages derived from group-normalized sparse terminal rewards are uniformly applied across timesteps, failing to accurately estimate the potential of early denoising steps with vast exploration spaces. (2) \textit{Reward-mixing}: predefined weights for combining multi-objective rewards (e.g., text accuracy, visual quality, text color)--which have mismatched scales and variances--lead to unstable gradients and conflicting updates. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{Multi-GRPO}, a multi-group advantage estimation framework with two orthogonal grouping mechanisms. For better credit assignment, we introduce tree-based trajectories inspired by Monte Carlo Tree Search: branching trajectories at selected early denoising steps naturally forms \emph{temporal groups}, enabling accurate advantage estimation for early steps via descendant leaves while amortizing computation through shared prefixes. For multi-objective optimization, we introduce \emph{reward-based grouping} to compute advantages for each reward function \textit{independently} before aggregation, disentangling conflicting signals. To facilitate evaluation of multiple objective alignment, we curate \textit{OCR-Color-10}, a visual text rendering dataset with explicit color constraints. Across the single-reward \textit{PickScore-25k} and multi-objective \textit{OCR-Color-10} benchmarks, Multi-GRPO achieves superior stability and alignment performance, effectively balancing conflicting objectives. Code will be publicly available at \href{https://github.com/fikry102/Multi-GRPO}{https://github.com/fikry102/Multi-GRPO}.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割存在边界模糊和专家标注差异的问题，现有方法无法同时实现结果多样性与个性化，需通过概率建模方法进行改进。

Result: 在NPC和LIDC-IDRI数据集上验证有效性，达到当前最优性能，支持灵活生成多样且符合专家特性的分割结果。

Conclusion: ProSeg通过概率建模同时解决了医学图像分割结果的多样性与个性化问题，可推广至其他多标注者医学图像分析任务。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is inherently influenced by data uncertainty, arising from ambiguous boundaries in medical scans and inter-observer variability in diagnosis. To address this challenge, previous works formulated the multi-rater medical image segmentation task, where multiple experts provide separate annotations for each image. However, existing models are typically constrained to either generate diverse segmentation that lacks expert specificity or to produce personalized outputs that merely replicate individual annotators. We propose Probabilistic modeling of multi-rater medical image Segmentation (ProSeg) that simultaneously enables both diversification and personalization. Specifically, we introduce two latent variables to model expert annotation preferences and image boundary ambiguity. Their conditional probabilistic distributions are then obtained through variational inference, allowing segmentation outputs to be generated by sampling from these distributions. Extensive experiments on both the nasopharyngeal carcinoma dataset (NPC) and the lung nodule dataset (LIDC-IDRI) demonstrate that our ProSeg achieves a new state-of-the-art performance, providing segmentation results that are both diverse and expert-personalized.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文介绍了FigEdit，一个大规模科学图表编辑基准，包含超过30,000个样本和五类渐进式难度任务，旨在推动结构感知的图表编辑模型发展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成模型专注于像素操作，但科学图表编辑需结构化转换（如数据与语法的对应关系），传统方法无法满足需求。

Method: 构建多维度基准FigEdit：包含10种图表类型、复杂编辑指令，并设计五类任务（单/多编辑、对话式编辑、视觉引导编辑、风格迁移），基于真实数据评估SOTA模型性能。

Result: 当前模型在结构化图表编辑中表现差，无法处理数据一致性约束；传统SSIM等像素级指标无法衡量语义正确性，验证了像素编辑方法的局限性。

Conclusion: 需发展理解图表结构语义双层次的模型，FigEdit为结构感知编辑研究提供标准评估平台，促进相关技术突破。

Abstract: Generative models, such as diffusion and autoregressive approaches, have demonstrated impressive capabilities in editing natural images. However, applying these tools to scientific charts rests on a flawed assumption: a chart is not merely an arrangement of pixels but a visual representation of structured data governed by a graphical grammar. Consequently, chart editing is not a pixel-manipulation task but a structured transformation problem. To address this fundamental mismatch, we introduce \textit{FigEdit}, a large-scale benchmark for scientific figure editing comprising over 30,000 samples. Grounded in real-world data, our benchmark is distinguished by its diversity, covering 10 distinct chart types and a rich vocabulary of complex editing instructions. The benchmark is organized into five distinct and progressively challenging tasks: single edits, multi edits, conversational edits, visual-guidance-based edits, and style transfer. Our evaluation of a range of state-of-the-art models on this benchmark reveals their poor performance on scientific figures, as they consistently fail to handle the underlying structured transformations required for valid edits. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that traditional evaluation metrics (e.g., SSIM, PSNR) have limitations in capturing the semantic correctness of chart edits. Our benchmark demonstrates the profound limitations of pixel-level manipulation and provides a robust foundation for developing and evaluating future structure-aware models. By releasing \textit{FigEdit} (https://github.com/adobe-research/figure-editing), we aim to enable systematic progress in structure-aware figure editing, provide a common ground for fair comparison, and encourage future research on models that understand both the visual and semantic layers of scientific charts.

Motivation: 计算机视觉领域长期缺乏对运动背后物理相互作用（如物体形变和移动的隐形力）的研究，现有方法难以直接推断这些隐藏的物理驱动因素。

Method: 设计了一种端到端不同iable inverse graphics framework，通过反向传播联合学习物体几何、物理属性及与外界力场的交互，将物体运动反推为隐含物理力表示。

Conclusion: 该方法通过建立像素与物理定律的联系，为理解视觉数据背后的物理过程提供了新路径，并证明了深度学习与物理建模结合在动态场景理解中的价值。

Abstract: A longstanding goal in computer vision is to model motions from videos, while the representations behind motions, i.e. the invisible physical interactions that cause objects to deform and move, remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we study how to recover the invisible forces from visual observations, e.g., estimating the wind field by observing a leaf falling to the ground. Our key innovation is an end-to-end differentiable inverse graphics framework, which jointly models object geometry, physical properties, and interactions directly from videos. Through backpropagation, our approach enables the recovery of force representations from object motions. We validate our method on both synthetic and real-world scenarios, and the results demonstrate its ability to infer plausible force fields from videos. Furthermore, we show the potential applications of our approach, including physics-based video generation and editing. We hope our approach sheds light on understanding and modeling the physical process behind pixels, bridging the gap between vision and physics.

Motivation: 现有RGB-only方法在动态物体和极端光照条件下表现不足，需克服传统相机的局限性。

Method: 基于MonST3R框架，引入1) 视网膜启发的图像增强模块和基于信噪比的轻量级事件适配器融合机制；2) 新的事件光度一致性损失。

Result: 在单目深度估计、相机姿态跟踪和动态重建任务中显著优于现有RGB方法，且无需夜间数据重训练。

Conclusion: 通过事件流时空相干性提升低光动态场景的几何估计性能，无需依赖额外训练。

Abstract: Robust 3D geometry estimation from videos is critical for applications such as autonomous navigation, SLAM, and 3D scene reconstruction. Recent methods like DUSt3R demonstrate that regressing dense pointmaps from image pairs enables accurate and efficient pose-free reconstruction. However, existing RGB-only approaches struggle under real-world conditions involving dynamic objects and extreme illumination, due to the inherent limitations of conventional cameras. In this paper, we propose EAG3R, a novel geometry estimation framework that augments pointmap-based reconstruction with asynchronous event streams. Built upon the MonST3R backbone, EAG3R introduces two key innovations: (1) a retinex-inspired image enhancement module and a lightweight event adapter with SNR-aware fusion mechanism that adaptively combines RGB and event features based on local reliability; and (2) a novel event-based photometric consistency loss that reinforces spatiotemporal coherence during global optimization. Our method enables robust geometry estimation in challenging dynamic low-light scenes without requiring retraining on night-time data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EAG3R significantly outperforms state-of-the-art RGB-only baselines across monocular depth estimation, camera pose tracking, and dynamic reconstruction tasks.

TL;DR: 本文提出PolarGS，通过引入光学偏振先验解决3D高斯散射技术在反射/无纹理区域的光度歧义问题，采用偏振引导的光度校正与基于PatchMatch的深度补全双模块实现更精确的几何重建。

Motivation: 现有3DGS技术在反射和无纹理区域因光度线索不可靠导致几何估计不准确。偏振特性（如DoLP/AoLP）能反映表面方向，可作为补充光度线索的光学先验，解决这类区域的光度一致性与几何估计难题。

Method: 1. 偏振引导的光度校正：利用度线性偏振（DoLP）识别反射区域，通过颜色优化图校正反射高斯分布；2. 偏振增强的斑点致密化：融合角度与度线性偏振（A/DoLP）信息，基于PatchMatch算法进行深度补全，实现新高斯的反投影与融合。

Conclusion: 光学偏振信息作为先验知识可有效增强3D高斯散射的光度一致性与几何重建能力，双模块设计显著提升了复杂场景下的重建完整性与准确性。

Abstract: Recent advances in surface reconstruction for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled remarkable geometric accuracy. However, their performance degrades in photometrically ambiguous regions such as reflective and textureless surfaces, where unreliable cues disrupt photometric consistency and hinder accurate geometry estimation. Reflected light is often partially polarized in a manner that reveals surface orientation, making polarization an optic complement to photometric cues in resolving such ambiguities. Therefore, we propose PolarGS, an optics-aware extension of RGB-based 3DGS that leverages polarization as an optical prior to resolve photometric ambiguities and enhance reconstruction accuracy. Specifically, we introduce two complementary modules: a polarization-guided photometric correction strategy, which ensures photometric consistency by identifying reflective regions via the Degree of Linear Polarization (DoLP) and refining reflective Gaussians with Color Refinement Maps; and a polarization-enhanced Gaussian densification mechanism for textureless area geometry recovery, which integrates both Angle and Degree of Linear Polarization (A/DoLP) into a PatchMatch-based depth completion process. This enables the back-projection and fusion of new Gaussians, leading to more complete reconstruction. PolarGS is framework-agnostic and achieves superior geometric accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 通过结构化数据采集与隐式神经表示创新，为复杂成像系统校准提供了可解释且物理一致的PSF估计方案

Abstract: The point spread function (PSF) serves as a fundamental descriptor linking the real-world scene to the captured signal, manifesting as camera blur. Accurate PSF estimation is crucial for both optical characterization and computational vision, yet remains challenging due to the inherent ambiguity and the ill-posed nature of intensity-based deconvolution. We introduce CircleFlow, a high-fidelity PSF estimation framework that employs flow-guided edge localization for precise blur characterization. CircleFlow begins with a structured capture that encodes locally anisotropic and spatially varying PSFs by imaging a circle grid target, while leveraging the target's binary luminance prior to decouple image and kernel estimation. The latent sharp image is then reconstructed through subpixel alignment of an initialized binary structure guided by optical flow, whereas the PSF is modeled as an energy-constrained implicit neural representation. Both components are jointly optimized within a demosaicing-aware differentiable framework, ensuring physically consistent and robust PSF estimation enabled by accurate edge localization. Extensive experiments on simulated and real-world data demonstrate that CircleFlow achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and reliability, validating its effectiveness for practical PSF calibration.

TL;DR: 本论文提出了一种基于强化学习的视频时间推理框架SpecTemp，通过协作式双模型设计（轻量级草稿模型快速探索关键帧，高性能目标模型验证）解决视频多模态大模型的时间推理效率瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频多模态大模型时间推理范式存在上下文冗余和效率瓶颈问题，且难以同时实现全局时间推理与局部帧级分析的平衡，需要新的框架在保证精度的同时提升计算效率。

Conclusion: 该工作通过仿生人脑协同机制的双模型架构，在视频时间推理任务中实现了效率与精度的平衡，为多模态大模型的实时应用提供了新的技术路径。

Abstract: Long video understanding is essential for human-like intelligence, enabling coherent perception and reasoning over extended temporal contexts. While the emerging thinking-with-frames paradigm, which alternates between global temporal reasoning and local frame examination, has advanced the reasoning capabilities of video multi-modal large language models (MLLMs), it suffers from a significant efficiency bottleneck due to the progressively growing and redundant multi-modal context. To address this, we propose SpecTemp, a reinforcement learning-based Speculative Temporal reasoning framework that decouples temporal perception from reasoning via a cooperative dual-model design. In SpecTemp, a lightweight draft MLLM rapidly explores and proposes salient frames from densely sampled temporal regions, while a powerful target MLLM focuses on temporal reasoning and verifies the draft's proposals, iteratively refining its attention until convergence. This design mirrors the collaborative pathways of the human brain, balancing efficiency with accuracy. To support training, we construct the SpecTemp-80K dataset, featuring synchronized dual-level annotations for coarse evidence spans and fine-grained frame-level evidence. Experiments across multiple video understanding benchmarks demonstrate that SpecTemp not only maintains competitive accuracy but also significantly accelerates inference compared with existing thinking-with-frames methods.

Conclusion: IRPO验证了低层次视觉后训练范式的有效性，为未来探索其他基础任务的后训练优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advances in post-training paradigms have achieved remarkable success in high-level generation tasks, yet their potential for low-level vision remains rarely explored. Existing image restoration (IR) methods rely on pixel-level hard-fitting to ground-truth images, struggling with over-smoothing and poor generalization. To address these limitations, we propose IRPO, a low-level GRPO-based post-training paradigm that systematically explores both data formulation and reward modeling. We first explore a data formulation principle for low-level post-training paradigm, in which selecting underperforming samples from the pre-training stage yields optimal performance and improved efficiency. Furthermore, we model a reward-level criteria system that balances objective accuracy and human perceptual preference through three complementary components: a General Reward for structural fidelity, an Expert Reward leveraging Qwen-VL for perceptual alignment, and a Restoration Reward for task-specific low-level quality. Comprehensive experiments on six in-domain and five out-of-domain (OOD) low-level benchmarks demonstrate that IRPO achieves state-of-the-art results across diverse degradation types, surpassing the AdaIR baseline by 0.83 dB on in-domain tasks and 3.43 dB on OOD settings.

Abstract: Panoramic video generation has attracted growing attention due to its applications in virtual reality and immersive media. However, existing methods lack explicit motion control and struggle to generate scenes with large and complex motions. We propose PanFlow, a novel approach that exploits the spherical nature of panoramas to decouple the highly dynamic camera rotation from the input optical flow condition, enabling more precise control over large and dynamic motions. We further introduce a spherical noise warping strategy to promote loop consistency in motion across panorama boundaries. To support effective training, we curate a large-scale, motion-rich panoramic video dataset with frame-level pose and flow annotations. We also showcase the effectiveness of our method in various applications, including motion transfer and video editing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PanFlow significantly outperforms prior methods in motion fidelity, visual quality, and temporal coherence.

Method: 提出了一种基于token级仿射变换的自适应特征重归一化技术，通过将低分辨率图像嵌入与高分辨率细节融合，并结合轻量化instruct-BLIP架构实现高效的GUI自动化。

Conclusion: AFRAgent通过结构优化和创新的特征融合方法，在保证性能的同时大幅降低计算资源消耗，为移动设备自动化提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: There is a growing demand for mobile user interface (UI) automation, driven by its broad applications across industries. With the advent of visual language models (VLMs), GUI automation has progressed from generating text-based instructions for humans to autonomously executing tasks, thus optimizing automation workflows. Recent approaches leverage VLMs for this problem due to their ability to 1) process on-screen content directly, 2) remain independent of device-specific APIs by utilizing human actions (e.g., clicks, typing), and 3) apply real-world contextual knowledge for task understanding. However, these models often have trouble accurately identifying widgets and determining actions due to limited spatial information in vision encoder features. Additionally, top-performing models are often large, requiring extensive training and resulting in inference delays. In this work, we introduce AFRAgent, an instruct-BLIP-based multimodal architecture that achieves superior performance in GUI automation while being less than one-fourth the size of its nearest competitor. To enhance image embeddings in the large language model (LLM) pipeline, we propose an adaptive feature renormalization-based (a token-level affine transformation) technique that effectively enriches low-resolution image embeddings and fuses high-resolution details. We evaluate AFRAgent on Meta-GUI and AITW benchmarks, establishing a new state-of-the-art baseline for smartphone automation.

Conclusion: 验证了一阶段压缩表征的可行性，为机器人导航、场景理解等下游任务提供了轻量级3D表征解决方案。

Abstract: We present Smol-GS, a novel method for learning compact representations for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Our approach learns highly efficient encodings in 3D space that integrate both spatial and semantic information. The model captures the coordinates of the splats through a recursive voxel hierarchy, while splat-wise features store abstracted cues, including color, opacity, transformation, and material properties. This design allows the model to compress 3D scenes by orders of magnitude without loss of flexibility. Smol-GS achieves state-of-the-art compression on standard benchmarks while maintaining high rendering quality. Beyond visual fidelity, the discrete representations could potentially serve as a foundation for downstream tasks such as navigation, planning, and broader 3D scene understanding.

Abstract: Existing foundation models (FMs) in the medical domain often require extensive fine-tuning or rely on training resource-intensive decoders, while many existing encoders are pretrained with objectives biased toward specific tasks. This illustrates a need for a strong, task-agnostic foundation model that requires minimal fine-tuning beyond feature extraction. In this work, we introduce a suite of task-agnostic pretraining of CT foundation models (TAP-CT): a simple yet effective adaptation of Vision Transformers (ViTs) and DINOv2 for volumetric data, enabling scalable self-supervised pretraining directly on 3D CT volumes. Our approach incorporates targeted modifications to patch embeddings, positional encodings, and volumetric augmentations, making the architecture depth-aware while preserving the simplicity of the underlying architectures. We show that large-scale 3D pretraining on an extensive in-house CT dataset (105K volumes) yields stable, robust frozen representations that generalize strongly across downstream tasks. To promote transparency and reproducibility, and to establish a powerful, low-resource baseline for future research in medical imaging, we will release all pretrained models, experimental configurations, and downstream benchmark code at https://huggingface.co/fomofo/tap-ct-b-3d.

Abstract: The rapid growth of multimodal intelligence on resource-constrained and heterogeneous domestic hardware exposes critical bottlenecks: multimodal feature heterogeneity, real-time requirements in dynamic scenarios, and hardware-specific operator redundancy. This work introduces a quantum-inspired geometric framework for neural operators that represents each operator by its normalized singular value spectrum on the Bloch hypersphere. We prove a tight spectral-to-functional equivalence theorem showing that vanishing Fubini--Study/Wasserstein-2 distance implies provable functional closeness, establishing the first rigorous foundation for cross-modal and cross-architecture operator substitutability. Based on this metric, we propose Quantum Metric-Driven Functional Redundancy Graphs (QM-FRG) and one-shot structured pruning. Controlled simulation validates the superiority of the proposed metric over magnitude and random baselines. An extensive experimental validation on large-scale multimodal transformers and domestic heterogeneous hardware (Huawei Ascend, Cambricon MLU, Kunlunxin) hardware is deferred to an extended journal version currently in preparation.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为'Look, Recite, Then Answer'的参数高效框架，通过分三阶段推理流程（视觉观察、知识检索、证据对齐）解决视觉语言模型在专业领域的幻觉问题，显著提升精准农业场景的准确性。


<details>

Motivation: 针对视觉语言模型在精准农业等领域因语言先验覆盖视觉感知而导致的性能瓶颈，需克服'Reasoning-Driven Hallucination'和视觉表征与专家知识间的'Modality Gap'问题。

Method: 采用三阶段框架：1) Look阶段生成视觉描述和候选集；2) Recite阶段用轻量路由模型将视觉线索转化为查询以激活参数知识；3) Answer阶段通过并行证据对齐选择最优标签，全程保持主干模型参数冻结。

Conclusion: 模块化设计通过主动知识检索机制有效抑制幻觉现象，在保持参数效率的同时实现跨模态一致性推理，为专业领域VLM应用提供了新范式。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit significant performance plateaus in specialized domains like precision agriculture, primarily due to "Reasoning-Driven Hallucination" where linguistic priors override visual perception. A key bottleneck is the "Modality Gap": visual embeddings fail to reliably activate the fine-grained expert knowledge already encoded in model parameters. We propose "Look, Recite, Then Answer," a parameter-efficient framework that enhances VLMs via self-generated knowledge hints while keeping backbone models frozen. The framework decouples inference into three stages: (1) Look generates objective visual descriptions and candidate sets; (2) Recite employs a lightweight 1.7B router to transform visual cues into targeted queries that trigger candidate-specific parametric knowledge; (3) Answer performs parallel evidence alignment between descriptions and recited knowledge to select the most consistent label. On AgroBench, our method achieves state-of-the-art results, improving Weed Identification accuracy by 23.6% over Qwen-VL and surpassing GPT-4o without external search overhead. This modular design mitigates hallucinations by transforming passive perception into active, controllable knowledge retrieval

Motivation: 现有HOI语义基准测试在时空细粒度推理上存在不足，无法全面捕捉操作与效果的动态关联，因此需要更精细化的评估框架。

Method: 构建包含11.1K多选问答对（Action/Process/Objects/Location/State Change/Object Parts六类）和10.3K分割掩码的数据集，支持操作与效果的双向推理和物体/部件级分割验证。

Result: 当前最佳模型Gemini-2.5-Pro仅达到73%平均准确率（人类97%），发现空间关系、运动及部件几何理解仍存挑战；整合HOI特征可提升性能。

Conclusion: HanDyVQA揭示了现有模型在细粒度HOI动态理解上的显著差距，建议强化显式交互线索建模与多模态特征融合方向研究。

Abstract: Hand-object interaction (HOI) inherently involves dynamics where human manipulations produce distinct spatio-temporal effects on objects. However, existing semantic HOI benchmarks focused either on manipulation or on the resulting effects at a coarse level, lacking fine-grained spatio-temporal reasoning to capture the underlying dynamics in HOI. We introduce HanDyVQA, a fine-grained video question-answering benchmark that comprehensively covers both the manipulation and effect aspects of HOI. HanDyVQA comprises six complementary question types (Action, Process, Objects, Location, State Change, and Object Parts), totalling 11.1K multiple-choice QA pairs. Collected QA pairs recognizing manipulation styles, hand/object motions, and part-level state changes. HanDyVQA also includes 10.3K segmentation masks for Objects and Object Parts questions, enabling the evaluation of object/part-level reasoning in video object segmentation. We evaluated recent video foundation models on our benchmark and found that even the best-performing model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, reached only 73% average accuracy, which is far from human performance (97%). Further analysis shows the remaining challenges in spatial relationship, motion, and part-level geometric understanding. We also found that integrating explicit HOI-related cues into visual features improves performance, offering insights for developing future models with a deeper understanding of HOI dynamics.

Abstract: Remote sensing image captioning has advanced rapidly through encoder--decoder models, although the reliance on large annotated datasets and the focus on English restricts global applicability. To address these limitations, we propose the first training-free multilingual approach, based on retrieval-augmented prompting. For a given aerial image, we employ a domain-adapted SigLIP2 encoder to retrieve related captions and few-shot examples from a datastore, which are then provided to a language model. We explore two variants: an image-blind setup, where a multilingual Large Language Model (LLM) generates the caption from textual prompts alone, and an image-aware setup, where a Vision--Language Model (VLM) jointly processes the prompt and the input image. To improve the coherence of the retrieved content, we introduce a graph-based re-ranking strategy using PageRank on a graph of images and captions. Experiments on four benchmark datasets across ten languages demonstrate that our approach is competitive with fully supervised English-only systems and generalizes to other languages. Results also highlight the importance of re-ranking with PageRank, yielding up to 35% improvements in performance metrics. Additionally, it was observed that while VLMs tend to generate visually grounded but lexically diverse captions, LLMs can achieve stronger BLEU and CIDEr scores. Lastly, directly generating captions in the target language consistently outperforms other translation-based strategies. Overall, our work delivers one of the first systematic evaluations of multilingual, training-free captioning for remote sensing imagery, advancing toward more inclusive and scalable multimodal Earth observation systems.

Motivation: 流式视频场景下，现有VideoLLMs因处理密集视觉token的高计算成本和冗余帧处理导致实时部署困难，亟需在保持高精度的同时提升推理效率。

Method: 提出STC框架，包含STC-Cacher（缓存重复利用相似帧特征）和STC-Pruner（基于时空显著性保留关键token），通过分层token压缩优化ViT编码和LLM预填充流程。

Result: 在4个基准流式VideoLLM和5个数据集的实验表明，STC相较其他压缩方法效果更优，在ReKV框架下实现24.5%和45.3%的延迟降低，准确率保留达99%。

Conclusion: STC作为插件式框架有效解决了流式视频处理的效率瓶颈，为高精度低延迟实时应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Streaming Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across various video understanding tasks, but they face significant challenges in real-time deployment due to the high computational cost of processing dense visual tokens from continuous video streams. In streaming video scenarios, the primary bottleneck lies in the Vision Transformer (ViT) encoding stage, where redundant processing of temporally similar frames leads to inefficiency. Additionally, inflated token sequences during LLM pre-filling further exacerbate latency and memory overhead. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{S}treaming \textbf{T}oken \textbf{C}ompression (\textbf{STC}), a plug-and-play hierarchical framework that seamlessly integrates into existing streaming VideoLLMs, optimizing both ViT encoding and LLM pre-filling stages to accelerate processing. STC introduces two token-level accelerators: \textbf{STC-Cacher}, which reduces ViT encoding overhead by caching and reusing features from temporally similar frames, and \textbf{STC-Pruner}, which compresses the visual token sequence before it enters the LLM, preserving only the most salient tokens based on both spatial and temporal relevance. Extensive experiments on four baseline streaming VideoLLMs across five benchmarks demonstrate that STC outperforms other compression methods. Notably, STC retains up to \textbf{99\%} of accuracy on the ReKV framework while reducing ViT encoding latency and LLM pre-filling latency by \textbf{24.5\%} and \textbf{45.3\%}.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models built on pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show strong potential but are limited in practicality due to their large parameter counts. To mitigate this issue, using a lightweight VLM has been explored, but it compromises spatiotemporal reasoning. Although some methods suggest that incorporating additional 3D inputs can help, they usually rely on large VLMs to fuse 3D and 2D inputs and still lack temporal understanding. Therefore, we propose SwiftVLA, an architecture that enhances a compact model with 4D understanding while preserving design efficiency. Specifically, our approach features a pretrained 4D visual geometry transformer with a temporal cache that extracts 4D features from 2D images. Then, to enhance the VLM's ability to exploit both 2D images and 4D features, we introduce Fusion Tokens, a set of learnable tokens trained with a future prediction objective to generate unified representations for action generation. Finally, we introduce a mask-and-reconstruct strategy that masks 4D inputs to the VLM and trains the VLA to reconstruct them, enabling the VLM to learn effective 4D representations and allowing the 4D branch to be dropped at inference with minimal performance loss. Experiments in real and simulated environments show that SwiftVLA outperforms lightweight baselines and rivals VLAs up to 7 times larger, achieving comparable performance on edge devices while being 18 times faster and reducing memory footprint by 12 times.

Abstract: Image clustering is a classic problem in computer vision, which categorizes images into different groups. Recent studies utilize nouns as external semantic knowledge to improve clus- tering performance. However, these methods often overlook the inherent ambiguity of nouns, which can distort semantic representations and degrade clustering quality. To address this issue, we propose a hierarChical semAntic alignmEnt method for image clustering, dubbed CAE, which improves cluster- ing performance in a training-free manner. In our approach, we incorporate two complementary types of textual seman- tics: caption-level descriptions, which convey fine-grained attributes of image content, and noun-level concepts, which represent high-level object categories. We first select relevant nouns from WordNet and descriptions from caption datasets to construct a semantic space aligned with image features. Then, we align image features with selected nouns and captions via optimal transport to obtain a more discriminative semantic space. Finally, we combine the enhanced semantic and image features to perform clustering. Extensive experiments across 8 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, notably surpassing the state-of-the-art training-free approach with a 4.2% improvement in accuracy and a 2.9% improvement in adjusted rand index (ARI) on the ImageNet-1K dataset.

Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive deep learning pipeline for the automated classification of 12 foraminifera species using 2D micro-CT slices derived from 3D scans. We curated a scientifically rigorous dataset comprising 97 micro-CT scanned specimens across 27 species, selecting 12 species with sufficient representation for robust machine learning.

We evaluated seven state-of-the-art 2D convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures using transfer learning. Our final ensemble model, combining ConvNeXt-Large and EfficientNetV2-Small, achieved a test accuracy of 95.64%, with a top-3 accuracy of 99.6% and an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.998 across all species. To facilitate practical deployment, we developed an interactive advanced dashboard that supports real-time slice classification and 3D slice matching using advanced similarity metrics, including SSIM, NCC, and the Dice coefficient. This work establishes new benchmarks for AI-assisted micropaleontological identification and provides a fully reproducible framework for foraminifera classification research, bridging the gap between deep learning and applied geosciences.

*Keita Otani,Tatsuya Harada*

TL;DR: SceneProp addresses the challenge of grounding complex visual queries by reformulating scene-graph grounding as a MAP inference problem in a Markov Random Field (MRF), leveraging global inference for improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing phrase grounding methods struggle with compositional visual queries involving multiple objects and relationships. They lack structural inductive bias to parse complex relational descriptions, leading to performance degradation as queries become more descriptive.

Method: SceneProp applies Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) inference in a Markov Random Field (MRF) framework for scene-graph grounding. It performs global inference over the entire query graph using a differentiable implementation of the Belief Propagation algorithm to find optimal assignments of image regions to graph nodes.

Result: SceneProp outperforms prior methods on four benchmarks, with accuracy improvements scaling positively as query graph size and complexity increase - demonstrating that relational context can be effectively exploited for better grounding.

Conclusion: A structural approach with global inference (SceneProp) resolves limitations in relational visual query grounding. The method shows that complex compositional queries provide more relational context that should be leveraged rather than treated as noise.

Abstract: Grounding complex, compositional visual queries with multiple objects and relationships is a fundamental challenge for vision-language models. While standard phrase grounding methods excel at localizing single objects, they lack the structural inductive bias to parse intricate relational descriptions, often failing as queries become more descriptive. To address this structural deficit, we focus on scene-graph grounding, a powerful but less-explored formulation where the query is an explicit graph of objects and their relationships. However, existing methods for this task also struggle, paradoxically showing decreased performance as the query graph grows -- failing to leverage the very information that should make grounding easier. We introduce SceneProp, a novel method that resolves this issue by reformulating scene-graph grounding as a Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) inference problem in a Markov Random Field (MRF). By performing global inference over the entire query graph, SceneProp finds the optimal assignment of image regions to nodes that jointly satisfies all constraints. This is achieved within an end-to-end framework via a differentiable implementation of the Belief Propagation algorithm. Experiments on four benchmarks show that our dedicated focus on the scene-graph grounding formulation allows SceneProp to significantly outperform prior work. Critically, its accuracy consistently improves with the size and complexity of the query graph, demonstrating for the first time that more relational context can, and should, lead to better grounding.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has emerged as an efficient 3D representation and a promising foundation for semantic tasks like segmentation. However, existing 3D-GS-based segmentation methods typically rely on high-dimensional category features, which introduce substantial memory overhead. Moreover, fine-grained segmentation remains challenging due to label space congestion and the lack of stable multi-granularity control mechanisms. To address these limitations, we propose a coarse-to-fine binary encoding scheme for per-Gaussian category representation, which compresses each feature into a single integer via the binary-to-decimal mapping, drastically reducing memory usage. We further design a progressive training strategy that decomposes panoptic segmentation into a series of independent sub-tasks, reducing inter-class conflicts and thereby enhancing fine-grained segmentation capability. Additionally, we fine-tune opacity during segmentation training to address the incompatibility between photometric rendering and semantic segmentation, which often leads to foreground-background confusion. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance while significantly reducing memory consumption and accelerating inference.

Abstract: In the domain of moment retrieval, accurately identifying temporal segments within videos based on natural language queries remains challenging. Traditional methods often employ pre-trained models that struggle with fine-grained information and deterministic reasoning, leading to difficulties in aligning with complex or ambiguous moments. To overcome these limitations, we explore Deep Evidential Regression (DER) to construct a vanilla Evidential baseline. However, this approach encounters two major issues: the inability to effectively handle modality imbalance and the structural differences in DER's heuristic uncertainty regularizer, which adversely affect uncertainty estimation. This misalignment results in high uncertainty being incorrectly associated with accurate samples rather than challenging ones. Our observations indicate that existing methods lack the adaptability required for complex video scenarios. In response, we propose Debiased Evidential Learning for Moment Retrieval (DEMR), a novel framework that incorporates a Reflective Flipped Fusion (RFF) block for cross-modal alignment and a query reconstruction task to enhance text sensitivity, thereby reducing bias in uncertainty estimation. Additionally, we introduce a Geom-regularizer to refine uncertainty predictions, enabling adaptive alignment with difficult moments and improving retrieval accuracy. Extensive testing on standard datasets and debiased datasets ActivityNet-CD and Charades-CD demonstrates significant enhancements in effectiveness, robustness, and interpretability, positioning our approach as a promising solution for temporal-semantic robustness in moment retrieval.

Abstract: A generalist robotic policy needs both semantic understanding for task planning and the ability to interact with the environment through predictive capabilities. To tackle this, we present MM-ACT, a unified Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model that integrates text, image, and action in shared token space and performs generation across all three modalities. MM-ACT adopts a re-mask parallel decoding strategy for text and image generation, and employs a one-step parallel decoding strategy for action generation to improve efficiency. We introduce Context-Shared Multimodal Learning, a unified training paradigm that supervises generation in all three modalities from a shared context, enhancing action generation through cross-modal learning. Experiments were conducted on the LIBERO simulation and Franka real-robot setups as well as RoboTwin2.0 to assess in-domain and out-of-domain performances respectively. Our approach achieves a success rate of 96.3% on LIBERO, 72.0% across three tasks of real Franka, and 52.38% across eight bimanual tasks of RoboTwin2.0 with an additional gain of 9.25% from cross-modal learning.

Given a poorly composed image, PhotoFramer first describes how to improve the composition in natural language and then generates a well-composed example image. To train such a model, we curate a large-scale dataset. Inspired by how humans take photos, we organize composition guidance into a hierarchy of sub-tasks: shift, zoom-in, and view-change tasks. Shift and zoom-in data are sampled from existing cropping datasets, while view-change data are obtained via a two-stage pipeline. First, we sample pairs with varying viewpoints from multi-view datasets, and train a degradation model to transform well-composed photos into poorly composed ones. Second, we apply this degradation model to expert-taken photos to synthesize poor images to form training pairs. Using this dataset, we finetune a model that jointly processes and generates both text and images, enabling actionable textual guidance with illustrative examples. Extensive experiments demonstrate that textual instructions effectively steer image composition, and coupling them with exemplars yields consistent improvements over exemplar-only baselines. PhotoFramer offers a practical step toward composition assistants that make expert photographic priors accessible to everyday users. Codes, model weights, and datasets have been released in https://zhiyuanyou.github.io/photoframer.

Abstract: Part-level point cloud segmentation has recently attracted significant attention in 3D computer vision. Nevertheless, existing research is constrained by two major challenges: native 3D models lack generalization due to data scarcity, while introducing 2D pre-trained knowledge often leads to inconsistent segmentation results across different views. To address these challenges, we propose S2AM3D, which incorporates 2D segmentation priors with 3D consistent supervision. We design a point-consistent part encoder that aggregates multi-view 2D features through native 3D contrastive learning, producing globally consistent point features. A scale-aware prompt decoder is then proposed to enable real-time adjustment of segmentation granularity via continuous scale signals. Simultaneously, we introduce a large-scale, high-quality part-level point cloud dataset with more than 100k samples, providing ample supervision signals for model training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that S2AM3D achieves leading performance across multiple evaluation settings, exhibiting exceptional robustness and controllability when handling complex structures and parts with significant size variations.

Abstract: Medical imaging is essential for clinical diagnosis, yet real-world data frequently suffers from corruption, noise, and potential tampering, challenging the reliability of AI-assisted interpretation. Conventional reconstruction techniques prioritize pixel-level recovery and may produce visually plausible outputs while compromising anatomical fidelity, an issue that can directly impact clinical outcomes. We propose a semantic-aware medical image reconstruction framework that integrates high-level latent embeddings with a hybrid U-Net architecture to preserve clinically relevant structures during restoration. To ensure trust and accountability, we incorporate a lightweight blockchain-based provenance layer using scale-free graph design, enabling verifiable recording of each reconstruction event without imposing significant overhead. Extensive evaluation across multiple datasets and corruption types demonstrates improved structural consistency, restoration accuracy, and provenance integrity compared with existing approaches. By uniting semantic-guided reconstruction with secure traceability, our solution advances dependable AI for medical imaging, enhancing both diagnostic confidence and regulatory compliance in healthcare environments.

Abstract: Text-driven 3D reconstruction demands a mask generator that simultaneously understands open-vocabulary instructions and remains consistent across viewpoints. We present LISA-3D, a two-stage framework that lifts language-image segmentation into 3D by retrofitting the instruction-following model LISA with geometry-aware Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) layers and reusing a frozen SAM-3D reconstructor. During training we exploit off-the-shelf RGB-D sequences and their camera poses to build a differentiable reprojection loss that enforces cross-view agreement without requiring any additional 3D-text supervision. The resulting masks are concatenated with RGB images to form RGBA prompts for SAM-3D, which outputs Gaussian splats or textured meshes without retraining. Across ScanRefer and Nr3D, LISA-3D improves language-to-3D accuracy by up to +15.6 points over single-view baselines while adapting only 11.6M parameters. The system is modular, data-efficient, and supports zero-shot deployment on unseen categories, providing a practical recipe for language-guided 3D content creation.

Motivation: 解决现有判别回归模型需依赖大规模高质数据的局限性，以及扩散模型在确定性几何推断中的次优表现，旨在探索预训练生成先验的高效利用方案。

Method: 第一阶段通过单步确定性公式结合局部连续性模块生成全局一致结构，第二阶段在核心预测器定义的流形内进行多步精炼提升几何细节分辨率。

Conclusion: 扩散模型可作为确定性世界先验，突破传统判别式与生成式方法局限，实现高质量的几何推理能力。

Abstract: Recovering pixel-wise geometric properties from a single image is fundamentally ill-posed due to appearance ambiguity and non-injective mappings between 2D observations and 3D structures. While discriminative regression models achieve strong performance through large-scale supervision, their success is bounded by the scale, quality and diversity of available data and limited physical reasoning. Recent diffusion models exhibit powerful world priors that encode geometry and semantics learned from massive image-text data, yet directly reusing their stochastic generative formulation is suboptimal for deterministic geometric inference: the former is optimized for diverse and high-fidelity image generation, whereas the latter requires stable and accurate predictions. In this work, we propose Lotus-2, a two-stage deterministic framework for stable, accurate and fine-grained geometric dense prediction, aiming to provide an optimal adaption protocol to fully exploit the pre-trained generative priors. Specifically, in the first stage, the core predictor employs a single-step deterministic formulation with a clean-data objective and a lightweight local continuity module (LCM) to generate globally coherent structures without grid artifacts. In the second stage, the detail sharpener performs a constrained multi-step rectified-flow refinement within the manifold defined by the core predictor, enhancing fine-grained geometry through noise-free deterministic flow matching. Using only 59K training samples, less than 1% of existing large-scale datasets, Lotus-2 establishes new state-of-the-art results in monocular depth estimation and highly competitive surface normal prediction. These results demonstrate that diffusion models can serve as deterministic world priors, enabling high-quality geometric reasoning beyond traditional discriminative and generative paradigms.

Motivation: 现有VLMs可能依赖静态特征偏差（如背景/物体特征）而非动态视觉变化，导致系统性预测错误。需要在实际部署前识别此类偏差以提升模型可靠性。

Method: TRoVe基于已训练VLM和标注验证集，提取候选静态特征并结合两种指标进行评分：1)特征对分类错误的影响程度；2)VLM对特征依赖程度。设计评估框架验证方法有效性.

Result: 28.6%的准确率提升优于现有基线；成功识别VLM的静态偏差，并通过调整偏差特征实现测试阶段性能优化。

Conclusion: TRoVe揭示了VLM中普遍存在的隐性静态偏差问题，证明针对性修正可提升模型鲁棒性，且提出大规模评估框架为后续研究提供基准。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have made great strides in addressing temporal understanding tasks, which involve characterizing visual changes across a sequence of images. However, recent works have suggested that when making predictions, VLMs may rely on static feature biases, such as background or object features, rather than dynamic visual changes. Static feature biases are a type of shortcut and can contribute to systematic prediction errors on downstream tasks; as a result, identifying and characterizing error-inducing static feature biases is critical prior to real-world model deployment. In this work, we introduce TRoVe, an automated approach for discovering error-inducing static feature biases learned by temporal VLMs. Given a trained VLM and an annotated validation dataset associated with a downstream classification task, TRoVe extracts candidate static features from the dataset and scores each feature by (i) the effect of the feature on classification errors as well as (ii) the extent to which the VLM relies on the feature when making predictions. In order to quantitatively evaluate TRoVe, we introduce an evaluation framework consisting of 101 trained temporal VLMs paired with ground-truth annotations for learned static feature biases. We use this framework to demonstrate that TRoVe can accurately identify error-inducing static feature biases in VLMs, achieving a 28.6% improvement over the closest baseline. Finally, we apply TRoVe to 7 off-the-shelf VLMs and 2 temporal understanding tasks, surfacing previously-unknown static feature biases and demonstrating that knowledge of learned biases can aid in improving model performance at test time.

TL;DR: 减少ViT-B/16中MLP块的参数量可提升训练稳定性与吞吐效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在ImageNet-1K数据集上，ViT-B/16模型是否存在冗余参数问题

Method: 设计两种MLP参数削减策略：跨层权重共享（GroupedMLP）和降低隐层维度（ShallowMLP）

Result: 两种模型分别提升Top-1精度0.42%和0.2%，训练稳定性提升10倍以上，ShallowMLP推理吞吐提高38%

Conclusion: 证明ViT的MLP模块存在过参数化现象，结构约束可改善模型性能

Abstract: Although scaling laws and many empirical results suggest that increasing the size of Vision Transformers often improves performance, model accuracy and training behavior are not always monotonically increasing with scale. Focusing on ViT-B/16 trained on ImageNet-1K, we study two simple parameter-reduction strategies applied to the MLP blocks, each removing 32.7\% of the baseline parameters. Our \emph{GroupedMLP} variant shares MLP weights between adjacent transformer blocks and achieves 81.47\% top-1 accuracy while maintaining the baseline computational cost. Our \emph{ShallowMLP} variant halves the MLP hidden dimension and reaches 81.25\% top-1 accuracy with a 38\% increase in inference throughput. Both models outperform the 86.6M-parameter baseline (81.05\%) and exhibit substantially improved training stability, reducing peak-to-final accuracy degradation from 0.47\% to the range 0.03\% to 0.06\%. These results suggest that, for ViT-B/16 on ImageNet-1K with a standard training recipe, the model operates in an overparameterized regime in which MLP capacity can be reduced without harming performance and can even slightly improve it. More broadly, our findings suggest that architectural constraints such as parameter sharing and reduced width may act as useful inductive biases, and highlight the importance of how parameters are allocated when designing Vision Transformers.

Result: 在相同图像质量下，生成步骤减少3倍，实验验证了该方法在加速效果和质量保持方面的有效性。

Conclusion: Speed-RL通过强化学习框架成功平衡了生成速度与质量，为MGM加速提供了新范式。

Abstract: Masked Generative Models (MGM)s demonstrate strong capabilities in generating high-fidelity images. However, they need many sampling steps to create high-quality generations, resulting in slow inference speed. In this work, we propose Speed-RL, a novel paradigm for accelerating a pretrained MGMs to generate high-quality images in fewer steps. Unlike conventional distillation methods which formulate the acceleration problem as a distribution matching problem, where a few-step student model is trained to match the distribution generated by a many-step teacher model, we consider this problem as a reinforcement learning problem. Since the goal of acceleration is to generate high quality images in fewer steps, we can combine a quality reward with a speed reward and finetune the base model using reinforcement learning with the combined reward as the optimization target. Through extensive experiments, we show that the proposed method was able to accelerate the base model by a factor of 3x while maintaining comparable image quality.

Motivation: 随着周期性动态在现实过程中的重要性，当前 VLM 需要更系统化的方式评估其时间推理能力，而此领域先前数据集无法充分满足该需求。

Method: 设计合成视频数据集 CycliST，包含周期性物体运动与视觉属性变化，采用多层级评估机制，通过调节循环物体数、场景杂乱度与光照条件逐步增加难度。

Conclusion: 论文揭示 VLM 领域存在显著时间推理短板，并提供 CycliST 促进未来周期模式建模研究。

Abstract: We present CycliST, a novel benchmark dataset designed to evaluate Video Language Models (VLM) on their ability for textual reasoning over cyclical state transitions. CycliST captures fundamental aspects of real-world processes by generating synthetic, richly structured video sequences featuring periodic patterns in object motion and visual attributes. CycliST employs a tiered evaluation system that progressively increases difficulty through variations in the number of cyclic objects, scene clutter, and lighting conditions, challenging state-of-the-art models on their spatio-temporal cognition. We conduct extensive experiments with current state-of-the-art VLMs, both open-source and proprietary, and reveal their limitations in generalizing to cyclical dynamics such as linear and orbital motion, as well as time-dependent changes in visual attributes like color and scale. Our results demonstrate that present-day VLMs struggle to reliably detect and exploit cyclic patterns, lack a notion of temporal understanding, and are unable to extract quantitative insights from scenes, such as the number of objects in motion, highlighting a significant technical gap that needs to be addressed. More specifically, we find no single model consistently leads in performance: neither size nor architecture correlates strongly with outcomes, and no model succeeds equally well across all tasks. By providing a targeted challenge and a comprehensive evaluation framework, CycliST paves the way for visual reasoning models that surpass the state-of-the-art in understanding periodic patterns.

Abstract: The integration of histology images and gene profiles has shown great promise for improving survival prediction in cancer. However, current approaches often struggle to model intra- and inter-modal interactions efficiently and effectively due to the high dimensionality and complexity of the inputs. A major challenge is capturing critical prognostic events that, though few, underlie the complexity of the observed inputs and largely determine patient outcomes. These events, manifested as high-level structural signals such as spatial histologic patterns or pathway co-activations, are typically sparse, patient-specific, and unannotated, making them inherently difficult to uncover. To address this, we propose SlotSPE, a slot-based framework for structural prognostic event modeling. Specifically, inspired by the principle of factorial coding, we compress each patient's multimodal inputs into compact, modality-specific sets of mutually distinctive slots using slot attention. By leveraging these slot representations as encodings for prognostic events, our framework enables both efficient and effective modeling of complex intra- and inter-modal interactions, while also facilitating seamless incorporation of biological priors that enhance prognostic relevance. Extensive experiments on ten cancer benchmarks show that SlotSPE outperforms existing methods in 8 out of 10 cohorts, achieving an overall improvement of 2.9%. It remains robust under missing genomic data and delivers markedly improved interpretability through structured event decomposition.

Conclusion: OmniFD通过多任务统一框架为真实场景中的人脸伪造检测提供了实用化、泛化的解决方案。

Abstract: Face forgery detection encompasses multiple critical tasks, including identifying forged images and videos and localizing manipulated regions and temporal segments. Current approaches typically employ task-specific models with independent architectures, leading to computational redundancy and ignoring potential correlations across related tasks. We introduce OmniFD, a unified framework that jointly addresses four core face forgery detection tasks within a single model, i.e., image and video classification, spatial localization, and temporal localization. Our architecture consists of three principal components: (1) a shared Swin Transformer encoder that extracts unified 4D spatiotemporal representations from both images and video inputs, (2) a cross-task interaction module with learnable queries that dynamically captures inter-task dependencies through attention-based reasoning, and (3) lightweight decoding heads that transform refined representations into corresponding predictions for all FFD tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate OmniFD's advantage over task-specific models. Its unified design leverages multi-task learning to capture generalized representations across tasks, especially enabling fine-grained knowledge transfer that facilitates other tasks. For example, video classification accuracy improves by 4.63% when image data are incorporated. Furthermore, by unifying images, videos and the four tasks within one framework, OmniFD achieves superior performance across diverse benchmarks with high efficiency and scalability, e.g., reducing 63% model parameters and 50% training time. It establishes a practical and generalizable solution for comprehensive face forgery detection in real-world applications. The source code is made available at https://github.com/haotianll/OmniFD.

Conclusion: 现有预训练策略可能损害模型社会认知能力的发展，揭示了开发具有社会意识训练范式的必要性。

Abstract: Understanding social interactions from visual cues is a fundamental challenge for a socially competent AI. While powerful pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable general capabilities, they surprisingly struggle to unify and learn multiple social perception tasks simultaneously, often exhibiting negative transfer. We identify that this negative transfer stems from a critical issue we term "social degradation," whereby the general visual-linguistic pre-training process of VLMs impairs the visual encoder's ability to represent nuanced social information. We investigate this behavior further under two lenses: decodability through linear representation probing and compatibility through gradient conflict analysis, revealing that both play a role in the degradation, especially the former, which is significantly compromised in the VLM pre-training process. To address these issues, we propose SocialFusion, a unified framework that learns a minimal connection between a frozen visual encoder and a language model. Compared with existing VLMs, it exhibits positive transfer across all five social tasks, leveraging synergies between them to enhance overall performance and achieves comparable performance to task-specific state-of-the-art models on various benchmarks. Our findings suggest that current VLM pre-training strategies may be detrimental to acquiring general social competence and highlight the need for more socially-aware training paradigms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗引导扩散采样在目标分类时常因轨迹偏差导致质量下降。现有方法未充分解决控制能量与感知保真度的关系，需建立理论联系以优化对抗控制策略。

Method: 基于随机最优控制理论，形式化路径-KL散度与控制能量的关系，并通过变分法推导切线空间投影的一阶最优条件，设计DPAC算法减少分布漂移。

Result: 理论证明最小化路径-KL可优化Wasserstein距离和FID上界；DPAC在离散求解器中消除主要误差项，实验验证其降低FID和路径-KL且具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DPAC通过保持分布特性减少对抗控制的能量消耗，在理论解释和实验效果上均优于传统方法，为扩散模型的对抗攻击提供了新视角。

Abstract: Adversarially guided diffusion sampling often achieves the target class, but sample quality degrades as deviations between the adversarially controlled and nominal trajectories accumulate. We formalize this degradation as a path-space Kullback-Leibler divergence(path-KL) between controlled and nominal (uncontrolled) diffusion processes, thereby showing via Girsanov's theorem that it exactly equals the control energy. Building on this stochastic optimal control (SOC) view, we theoretically establish that minimizing this path-KL simultaneously tightens upper bounds on both the 2-Wasserstein distance and Fréchet Inception Distance (FID), revealing a principled connection between adversarial control energy and perceptual fidelity. From a variational perspective, we derive a first-order optimality condition for the control: among all directions that yield the same classification gain, the component tangent to iso-(log-)density surfaces (i.e., orthogonal to the score) minimizes path-KL, whereas the normal component directly increases distributional drift. This leads to DPAC (Distribution-Preserving Adversarial Control), a diffusion guidance rule that projects adversarial gradients onto the tangent space defined by the generative score geometry. We further show that in discrete solvers, the tangent projection cancels the O(Δt) leading error term in the Wasserstein distance, achieving an O(Δt^2) quality gap; moreover, it remains second-order robust to score or metric approximation. Empirical studies on ImageNet-100 validate the theoretical predictions, confirming that DPAC achieves lower FID and estimated path-KL at matched attack success rates.

Abstract: Efficient and accurate annotation of datasets remains a significant challenge for deploying object detection models such as You Only Look Once (YOLO) in real-world applications, particularly in agriculture where rapid decision-making is critical. Traditional annotation techniques are labor-intensive, requiring extensive manual labeling post data collection. This paper presents a novel real-time annotation approach leveraging YOLO models deployed on edge devices, enabling immediate labeling during image capture. To comprehensively evaluate the efficiency and accuracy of our proposed system, we conducted an extensive comparative analysis using three prominent YOLO architectures (YOLOv5, YOLOv8, YOLOv12) under various configurations: single-class versus multi-class annotation and pretrained versus scratch-based training. Our analysis includes detailed statistical tests and learning dynamics, demonstrating significant advantages of pretrained and single-class configurations in terms of model convergence, performance, and robustness.

Conclusion: 无需3D标注的VSRD++框架有效性得到验证，尤其在动态场景中通过速度属性和RDF建模提升了几何一致性，为弱监督3D检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Monocular 3D object detection is a fundamental yet challenging task in 3D scene understanding. Existing approaches heavily depend on supervised learning with extensive 3D annotations, which are often acquired from LiDAR point clouds through labor-intensive labeling processes. To tackle this problem, we propose VSRD++, a novel weakly supervised framework for monocular 3D object detection that eliminates the reliance on 3D annotations and leverages neural-field-based volumetric rendering with weak 2D supervision. VSRD++ consists of a two-stage pipeline: multi-view 3D autolabeling and subsequent monocular 3D detector training. In the multi-view autolabeling stage, object surfaces are represented as signed distance fields (SDFs) and rendered as instance masks via the proposed instance-aware volumetric silhouette rendering. To optimize 3D bounding boxes, we decompose each instance's SDF into a cuboid SDF and a residual distance field (RDF) that captures deviations from the cuboid. To address the geometry inconsistency commonly observed in volume rendering methods applied to dynamic objects, we model the dynamic objects by including velocity into bounding box attributes as well as assigning confidence to each pseudo-label. Moreover, we also employ a 3D attribute initialization module to initialize the dynamic bounding box parameters. In the monocular 3D object detection phase, the optimized 3D bounding boxes serve as pseudo labels for training monocular 3D object detectors. Extensive experiments on the KITTI-360 dataset demonstrate that VSRD++ significantly outperforms existing weakly supervised approaches for monocular 3D object detection on both static and dynamic scenes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces TabletopGen, a training-free, automatic framework for generating diverse, physically realistic 3D tabletop scenes using reference images, with a novel two-stage pose and scale alignment method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D scene generation methods struggle with tabletop scenes due to their high-density layouts and complex spatial relations, which are critical for robotic manipulation and embodied AI.

Method: TabletopGen uses a reference image (from text-to-image synthesis) to perform instance segmentation and completion, followed by 3D reconstruction, canonical alignment, and a two-stage alignment method: a Differentiable Rotation Optimizer for rotation recovery and Top-view Spatial Alignment for translation and scale estimation, generating collision-free scenes.

Result: TabletopGen achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming previous methods in visual fidelity, layout accuracy, and physical plausibility, enabling realistic and diverse tabletop scenes.

Conclusion: TabletopGen effectively addresses the challenges of tabletop scene generation, providing a scalable, efficient, and physically accurate solution for embodied AI applications.

Abstract: Generating high-fidelity, physically interactive 3D simulated tabletop scenes is essential for embodied AI--especially for robotic manipulation policy learning and data synthesis. However, current text- or image-driven 3D scene generation methods mainly focus on large-scale scenes, struggling to capture the high-density layouts and complex spatial relations that characterize tabletop scenes. To address these challenges, we propose TabletopGen, a training-free, fully automatic framework that generates diverse, instance-level interactive 3D tabletop scenes. TabletopGen accepts a reference image as input, which can be synthesized by a text-to-image model to enhance scene diversity. We then perform instance segmentation and completion on the reference to obtain per-instance images. Each instance is reconstructed into a 3D model followed by canonical coordinate alignment. The aligned 3D models then undergo pose and scale estimation before being assembled into a collision-free, simulation-ready tabletop scene. A key component of our framework is a novel pose and scale alignment approach that decouples the complex spatial reasoning into two stages: a Differentiable Rotation Optimizer for precise rotation recovery and a Top-view Spatial Alignment mechanism for robust translation and scale estimation, enabling accurate 3D reconstruction from 2D reference. Extensive experiments and user studies show that TabletopGen achieves state-of-the-art performance, markedly surpassing existing methods in visual fidelity, layout accuracy, and physical plausibility, capable of generating realistic tabletop scenes with rich stylistic and spatial diversity. Our code will be publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了两种基于最小最大重构的实例级优化方法，有效解决了部分AUC（PAUC）优化中的近似误差问题，实现了高效的收敛和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PAUC在处理类不平衡和决策约束的实际场景中是关键指标，但其计算属于NP难问题，现有方法存在近似误差不可控或可扩展性受限的缺点。

Method: 通过实例级最小最大重构实现两种方法：一种具备渐近消失近似偏差，另一种通过增加变量确保无偏性；结合阈值学习简化样本选择，并应用平滑技术。

Result: 算法在单向/双向PAUC上达到O(ε⁻¹/₃)收敛速率，且每迭代步时间复杂度与样本量线性相关；理论分析揭示了TPR/FPR约束α/β对泛化界的显式影响（界阶数为Õ(α⁻¹n₊⁻¹ + β⁻¹n₋⁻¹)）；实验验证了方法优势。

Conclusion: 该研究通过降低计算复杂度并提供紧理论界，为PAUC优化提供了更高效的框架，显著提升了大规模不平衡数据下的分类器评估与优化效果。

Abstract: As a variant of the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC), the partial AUC (PAUC) focuses on a specific range of false positive rate (FPR) and/or true positive rate (TPR) in the ROC curve. It is a pivotal evaluation metric in real-world scenarios with both class imbalance and decision constraints. However, selecting instances within these constrained intervals during its calculation is NP-hard, and thus typically requires approximation techniques for practical resolution. Despite the progress made in PAUC optimization over the last few years, most existing methods still suffer from uncontrollable approximation errors or a limited scalability when optimizing the approximate PAUC objectives. In this paper, we close the approximation gap of PAUC optimization by presenting two simple instance-wise minimax reformulations: one with an asymptotically vanishing gap, the other with the unbiasedness at the cost of more variables. Our key idea is to first establish an equivalent instance-wise problem to lower the time complexity, simplify the complicated sample selection procedure by threshold learning, and then apply different smoothing techniques. Equipped with an efficient solver, the resulting algorithms enjoy a linear per-iteration computational complexity w.r.t. the sample size and a convergence rate of $O(ε^{-1/3})$ for typical one-way and two-way PAUCs. Moreover, we provide a tight generalization bound of our minimax reformulations. The result explicitly demonstrates the impact of the TPR/FPR constraints $α$/$β$ on the generalization and exhibits a sharp order of $\tilde{O}(α^{-1}\n_+^{-1} + β^{-1}\n_-^{-1})$. Finally, extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets validate the strength of our proposed methods.

Abstract: In the contemporary digital landscape, multi-modal media manipulation has emerged as a significant societal threat, impacting the reliability and integrity of information dissemination. Current detection methodologies in this domain often overlook the crucial aspect of localized information, despite the fact that manipulations frequently occur in specific areas, particularly in facial regions. In response to this critical observation, we propose the M4-BLIP framework. This innovative framework utilizes the BLIP-2 model, renowned for its ability to extract local features, as the cornerstone for feature extraction. Complementing this, we incorporate local facial information as prior knowledge. A specially designed alignment and fusion module within M4-BLIP meticulously integrates these local and global features, creating a harmonious blend that enhances detection accuracy. Furthermore, our approach seamlessly integrates with Large Language Models (LLM), significantly improving the interpretability of the detection outcomes. Extensive quantitative and visualization experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework against the state-of-the-art competitors.

Abstract: 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) focuses on locating objects in 3D scenes based on natural language descriptions, serving as a fundamental task for embodied AI and robotics. Recent advances in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have motivated research into extending them to 3DVG. However, MLLMs primarily process 2D visual inputs and struggle with understanding 3D spatial structure of scenes solely from these limited perspectives. Existing methods mainly utilize viewpoint-dependent rendering of reconstructed point clouds to provide explicit structural guidance for MLLMs in 3DVG tasks, leading to inefficiency and limited spatial reasoning. To address this issue, we propose S$^2$-MLLM, an efficient framework that enhances spatial reasoning in MLLMs through implicit spatial reasoning. We introduce a spatial guidance strategy that leverages the structure awareness of feed-forward 3D reconstruction. By acquiring 3D structural understanding during training, our model can implicitly reason about 3D scenes without relying on inefficient point cloud reconstruction. Moreover, we propose a structure-enhanced module (SE), which first employs intra-view and inter-view attention mechanisms to capture dependencies within views and correspondences across views. The module further integrates multi-level position encoding to associate visual representations with spatial positions and viewpoint information, enabling more accurate structural understanding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that S$^2$-MLLM unifies superior performance, generalization, and efficiency, achieving significant performance over existing methods across the ScanRefer, Nr3D, and Sr3D datasets. Code will be available upon acceptance.

Abstract: Personalized generation models for a single subject have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness, highlighting their significant potential. However, when extended to multiple subjects, existing models often exhibit degraded performance, particularly in maintaining subject consistency and adhering to textual prompts. We attribute these limitations to the absence of high-quality multi-subject datasets and refined post-training strategies. To address these challenges, we propose a scalable multi-subject data generation pipeline that leverages powerful single-subject generation models to construct diverse and high-quality multi-subject training data. Through this dataset, we first enable single-subject personalization models to acquire knowledge of synthesizing multi-image and multi-subject scenarios. Furthermore, to enhance both subject consistency and text controllability, we design a set of Pairwise Subject-Consistency Rewards and general-purpose rewards, which are incorporated into a refined reinforcement learning stage. To comprehensively evaluate multi-subject personalization, we introduce a new benchmark that assesses model performance using seven subsets across three dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in advancing multi-subject personalized image generation. Github Link: https://github.com/wang-shulei/PSR

Abstract: Table recognition (TR) aims to transform table images into semi-structured representations such as HTML or Markdown. As a core component of document parsing, TR has long relied on supervised learning, with recent efforts dominated by fine-tuning vision-language models (VLMs) using labeled data. While VLMs have brought TR to the next level, pushing performance further demands large-scale labeled data that is costly to obtain. Consequently, although proprietary models have continuously pushed the performance boundary, open-source models, often trained with limited resources and, in practice, the only viable option for many due to privacy regulations, still lag far behind. To bridge this gap, we introduce TRivia, a self-supervised fine-tuning method that enables pretrained VLMs to learn TR directly from unlabeled table images in the wild. Built upon Group Relative Policy Optimization, TRivia automatically identifies unlabeled samples that most effectively facilitate learning and eliminates the need for human annotations through a question-answering-based reward mechanism. An attention-guided module generates diverse questions for each table image, and the ability to interpret the recognition results and answer them correctly provides feedback to optimize the TR model. This closed-loop process allows the TR model to autonomously learn to recognize, structure, and reason over tables without labeled data. Leveraging this pipeline, we present TRivia-3B, an open-sourced, compact, and state-of-the-art TR model that surpasses existing systems (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Pro, MinerU2.5) on three popular benchmarks. Model and code are released at: https://github.com/opendatalab/TRivia

Abstract: Viscosity measurement is essential for process monitoring and autonomous laboratory operation, yet conventional viscometers remain invasive and require controlled laboratory environments that differ substantially from real process conditions. We present a computer-vision-based viscometer that infers viscosity by exploiting how a fixed background pattern becomes optically distorted as light refracts through the mixing-driven, continuously deforming free surface. Under diverse lighting conditions, the system achieves a mean absolute error of 0.113 in log m2 s^-1 units for regression and reaches up to 81% accuracy in viscosity-class prediction. Although performance declines for classes with closely clustered viscosity values, a multi-pattern strategy improves robustness by providing enriched visual cues. To ensure sensor reliability, we incorporate uncertainty quantification, enabling viscosity predictions with confidence estimates. This stand-off viscometer offers a practical, automation-ready alternative to existing viscometry methods.

Abstract: Acoustic sonar image analysis plays a critical role in object detection and classification, with applications in both civilian and defense domains. Despite the availability of real and synthetic datasets, existing AI models that achieve high accuracy often over-rely on seafloor features, leading to poor generalization. To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel framework that integrates two key modules: (i) a Targeted Contrastive Unlearning (TCU) module, which extends the traditional triplet loss to reduce seafloor-induced background bias and improve generalization, and (ii) the Unlearn to Explain Sonar Framework (UESF), which provides visual insights into what the model has deliberately forgotten while adapting the LIME explainer to generate more faithful and localized attributions for unlearning evaluation. Extensive experiments across both real and synthetic sonar datasets validate our approach, demonstrating significant improvements in unlearning effectiveness, model robustness, and interpretability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedSegLatDiff is a diffusion-based medical image segmentation framework combining a variational autoencoder (VAE) and latent diffusion to generate multiple plausible segmentation masks with uncertainty quantification. It introduces a weighted cross-entropy loss for small structure preservation and operates efficiently in compressed latent space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional segmentation methods produce deterministic single masks, failing to capture inherent uncertainty. Generative models addressing this issue often suffer from high computational costs, limiting clinical deployment. There is a need for efficient frameworks that provide both accurate segmentation and interpretable uncertainty quantification.

Method: 1) A VAE compresses inputs into a low-dimensional latent space to reduce noise and accelerate training. 2) A latent diffusion model generates diverse segmentation hypotheses in the compressed space. 3) The VAE's mask reconstruction path uses weighted cross-entropy loss to enhance small structure preservation (e.g., lung nodules). 4) Evaluated on ISIC-2018 (skin lesions), CVC-Clinic (polyps), and LIDC-IDRI (lung nodules).

Result: 1) Achieved state-of-the-art or competitive Dice/IoU scores on three medical datasets. 2) Generated multiple segmentation hypotheses and confidence maps simultaneously. 3) Outperformed deterministic baselines in interpretability and reliability. 4) Demonstrated computational efficiency through latent-space operations while maintaining structural detail fidelity (e.g., small nodules).

Conclusion: MedSegLatDiff balances segmentation accuracy, computational efficiency, and uncertainty quantification. The latent-space diffusion approach enables clinical-grade reliability through diverse hypotheses and confidence maps, making it suitable for real-world diagnostic applications compared to conventional single-mask methods.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is crucial for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning. Traditional methods typically produce a single segmentation mask, failing to capture inherent uncertainty. Recent generative models enable the creation of multiple plausible masks per image, mimicking the collaborative interpretation of several clinicians. However, these approaches remain computationally heavy. We propose MedSegLatDiff, a diffusion based framework that combines a variational autoencoder (VAE) with a latent diffusion model for efficient medical image segmentation. The VAE compresses the input into a low dimensional latent space, reducing noise and accelerating training, while the diffusion process operates directly in this compact representation. We further replace the conventional MSE loss with weighted cross entropy in the VAE mask reconstruction path to better preserve tiny structures such as small nodules. MedSegLatDiff is evaluated on ISIC-2018 (skin lesions), CVC-Clinic (polyps), and LIDC-IDRI (lung nodules). It achieves state of the art or highly competitive Dice and IoU scores while simultaneously generating diverse segmentation hypotheses and confidence maps. This provides enhanced interpretability and reliability compared to deterministic baselines, making the model particularly suitable for clinical deployment.

Abstract: Real-time 3D reconstruction is a fundamental task in computer graphics. Recently, differentiable-rendering-based SLAM system has demonstrated significant potential, enabling photorealistic scene rendering through learnable scene representations such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Current differentiable rendering methods face dual challenges in real-time computation and sensor noise sensitivity, leading to degraded geometric fidelity in scene reconstruction and limited practicality. To address these challenges, we propose a novel real-time system EGG-Fusion, featuring robust sparse-to-dense camera tracking and a geometry-aware Gaussian surfel mapping module, introducing an information filter-based fusion method that explicitly accounts for sensor noise to achieve high-precision surface reconstruction. The proposed differentiable Gaussian surfel mapping effectively models multi-view consistent surfaces while enabling efficient parameter optimization. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system achieves a surface reconstruction error of 0.6\textit{cm} on standardized benchmark datasets including Replica and ScanNet++, representing over 20\% improvement in accuracy compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) GS-based methods. Notably, the system maintains real-time processing capabilities at 24 FPS, establishing it as one of the most accurate differentiable-rendering-based real-time reconstruction systems.

Abstract: Despite recent text-to-image models achieving highfidelity text rendering, they still struggle with long or multiple texts due to diluted global attention. We propose DCText, a training-free visual text generation method that adopts a divide-and-conquer strategy, leveraging the reliable short-text generation of Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers. Our method first decomposes a prompt by extracting and dividing the target text, then assigns each to a designated region. To accurately render each segment within their regions while preserving overall image coherence, we introduce two attention masks - Text-Focus and Context-Expansion - applied sequentially during denoising. Additionally, Localized Noise Initialization further improves text accuracy and region alignment without increasing computational cost. Extensive experiments on single- and multisentence benchmarks show that DCText achieves the best text accuracy without compromising image quality while also delivering the lowest generation latency.

Abstract: Branches swaying in the breeze, flags rippling in the wind, and boats rocking on the water all show how aerodynamics shape natural motion -- an effect crucial for realism in vision and graphics. In this paper, we present Gaussian Swaying, a surface-based framework for aerodynamic simulation using 3D Gaussians. Unlike mesh-based methods that require costly meshing, or particle-based approaches that rely on discrete positional data, Gaussian Swaying models surfaces continuously with 3D Gaussians, enabling efficient and fine-grained aerodynamic interaction. Our framework unifies simulation and rendering on the same representation: Gaussian patches, which support force computation for dynamics while simultaneously providing normals for lightweight shading. Comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets across multiple metrics demonstrate that Gaussian Swaying achieves state-of-the-art performance and efficiency, offering a scalable approach for realistic aerodynamic scene simulation.

Abstract: Large-scale brain imaging datasets provide unprecedented opportunities for developing domain foundation models through pretraining. However, unlike natural image datasets in computer vision, these neuroimaging data often exhibit high heterogeneity in quality, ranging from well-structured scans to severely distorted or incomplete brain volumes. This raises a fundamental question: can noise or low-quality scans contribute meaningfully to pretraining, or do they instead hinder model learning? In this study, we systematically explore the role of data quality level in pretraining and its impact on downstream tasks. Specifically, we perform pretraining on datasets with different quality levels and perform fine-tuning for brain age prediction on external cohorts. Our results show significant performance differences across quality levels, revealing both opportunities and limitations. We further discuss the gap between computer vision practices and clinical neuroimaging standards, emphasizing the necessity of domain-aware curation to ensure trusted and generalizable domain-specific foundation models.

Abstract: In recent years, significant developments have been made in both video retrieval and video moment retrieval tasks, which respectively retrieve complete videos or moments for a given text query. These advancements have greatly improved user satisfaction during the search process. However, previous work has failed to establish meaningful "interaction" between the retrieval system and the user, and its one-way retrieval paradigm can no longer fully meet the personalization and dynamic needs of at least 80.8\% of users. In this paper, we introduce the Interactive Video Corpus Retrieval (IVCR) task, a more realistic setting that enables multi-turn, conversational, and realistic interactions between the user and the retrieval system. To facilitate research on this challenging task, we introduce IVCR-200K, a high-quality, bilingual, multi-turn, conversational, and abstract semantic dataset that supports video retrieval and even moment retrieval. Furthermore, we propose a comprehensive framework based on multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to help users interact in several modes with more explainable solutions. The extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our dataset and framework.

Result: 实验表明该方法在感知质量和内容一致性指标上均显著优于现有方法,达到SOTA性能.

Conclusion: TokenPure通过双token条件机制实现了watermark有效去除与原内容结构完整性保护的统一,为数字资产管理提供新思路.

Abstract: In the digital economy era, digital watermarking serves as a critical basis for ownership proof of massive replicable content, including AI-generated and other virtual assets. Designing robust watermarks capable of withstanding various attacks and processing operations is even more paramount. We introduce TokenPure, a novel Diffusion Transformer-based framework designed for effective and consistent watermark removal. TokenPure solves the trade-off between thorough watermark destruction and content consistency by leveraging token-based conditional reconstruction. It reframes the task as conditional generation, entirely bypassing the initial watermark-carrying noise. We achieve this by decomposing the watermarked image into two complementary token sets: visual tokens for texture and structural tokens for geometry. These tokens jointly condition the diffusion process, enabling the framework to synthesize watermark-free images with fine-grained consistency and structural integrity. Comprehensive experiments show that TokenPure achieves state-of-the-art watermark removal and reconstruction fidelity, substantially outperforming existing baselines in both perceptual quality and consistency.

Abstract: Foreign Object Debris (FOD) within aircraft fuel tanks presents critical safety hazards including fuel contamination, system malfunctions, and increased maintenance costs. Despite the severity of these risks, there is a notable lack of dedicated datasets for the complex, enclosed environments found inside fuel tanks. To bridge this gap, we present a novel dataset, FOD-S2R, composed of real and synthetic images of the FOD within a simulated aircraft fuel tank. Unlike existing datasets that focus on external or open-air environments, our dataset is the first to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of synthetic data in enhancing the real-world FOD detection performance in confined, closed structures. The real-world subset consists of 3,114 high-resolution HD images captured in a controlled fuel tank replica, while the synthetic subset includes 3,137 images generated using Unreal Engine. The dataset is composed of various Field of views (FOV), object distances, lighting conditions, color, and object size. Prior research has demonstrated that synthetic data can reduce reliance on extensive real-world annotations and improve the generalizability of vision models. Thus, we benchmark several state-of-the-art object detection models and demonstrate that introducing synthetic data improves the detection accuracy and generalization to real-world conditions. These experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of synthetic data in enhancing the model performance and narrowing the Sim2Real gap, providing a valuable foundation for developing automated FOD detection systems for aviation maintenance.

Abstract: The precise segmentation of intracranial aneurysms and their parent vessels (IA-Vessel) is a critical step for hemodynamic analyses, which mainly depends on computational fluid dynamics (CFD). However, current segmentation methods predominantly focus on image-based evaluation metrics, often neglecting their practical effectiveness in subsequent CFD applications. To address this deficiency, we present the Intracranial Aneurysm Vessel Segmentation (IAVS) dataset, the first comprehensive, multi-center collection comprising 641 3D MRA images with 587 annotations of aneurysms and IA-Vessels. In addition to image-mask pairs, IAVS dataset includes detailed hemodynamic analysis outcomes, addressing the limitations of existing datasets that neglect topological integrity and CFD applicability. To facilitate the development and evaluation of clinically relevant techniques, we construct two evaluation benchmarks including global localization of aneurysms (Stage I) and fine-grained segmentation of IA-Vessel (Stage II) and develop a simple and effective two-stage framework, which can be used as a out-of-the-box method and strong baseline. For comprehensive evaluation of applicability of segmentation results, we establish a standardized CFD applicability evaluation system that enables the automated and consistent conversion of segmentation masks into CFD models, offering an applicability-focused assessment of segmentation outcomes. The dataset, code, and model will be public available at https://github.com/AbsoluteResonance/IAVS.

Abstract: Stroke is a major cause of death and permanent impairment, making it a major worldwide health concern. For prompt intervention and successful preventative tactics, early risk assessment is essential. To address this challenge, we used ensemble modeling and explainable AI (XAI) techniques to create an interpretable machine learning framework for stroke risk prediction. A thorough evaluation of 10 different machine learning models using 5-fold cross-validation across several datasets was part of our all-inclusive strategy, which also included feature engineering and data pretreatment (using Random Over-Sampling (ROS) to solve class imbalance). Our optimized ensemble model (Random Forest + ExtraTrees + XGBoost) performed exceptionally well, obtaining a strong 99.09% accuracy on the Stroke Prediction Dataset (SPD). We improved the model's transparency and clinical applicability by identifying three important clinical variables using LIME-based interpretability analysis: age, hypertension, and glucose levels. Through early prediction, this study highlights how combining ensemble learning with explainable AI (XAI) can deliver highly accurate and interpretable stroke risk assessment. By enabling data-driven prevention and personalized clinical decisions, our framework has the potential to transform stroke prediction and cardiovascular risk management.

Conclusion: 该研究通过创建数据集和新框架，推动了多说话人生成领域的评估技术进步。

Abstract: Speech-driven Talking Human (TH) generation, commonly known as "Talker," currently faces limitations in multi-subject driving capabilities. Extending this paradigm to "Multi-Talker," capable of animating multiple subjects simultaneously, introduces richer interactivity and stronger immersion in audiovisual communication. However, current Multi-Talkers still exhibit noticeable quality degradation caused by technical limitations, resulting in suboptimal user experiences. To address this challenge, we construct THQA-MT, the first large-scale Multi-Talker-generated Talking Human Quality Assessment dataset, consisting of 5,492 Multi-Talker-generated THs (MTHs) from 15 representative Multi-Talkers using 400 real portraits collected online. Through subjective experiments, we analyze perceptual discrepancies among different Multi-Talkers and identify 12 common types of distortion. Furthermore, we introduce EvalTalker, a novel TH quality assessment framework. This framework possesses the ability to perceive global quality, human characteristics, and identity consistency, while integrating Qwen-Sync to perceive multimodal synchrony. Experimental results demonstrate that EvalTalker achieves superior correlation with subjective scores, providing a robust foundation for future research on high-quality Multi-Talker generation and evaluation.

TL;DR: 本论文提出InternVideo-Next框架，通过解耦传统编解码架构为Encoder-Predictor-Decoder（EPD）结构，并采用两阶段预训练方案优化视频-文本表示学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频-文本预训练方法依赖噪声标注，语义覆盖有限；而无监督的MVM方法存在架构缺陷（如像素重建冲突、潜变量预测易捷径学习），导致性能落后。

Method: 构建EPD架构，其中预测器作为潜世界模型。阶段1采用条件扩散解码器注入图像级语义先验，阶段2在该空间内通过固定阶段1目标预测世界知识，缓解捷径学习。

Result: 基于公开无标签视频训练后，InternVideo-Next在多项基准确保最优性能，且支持可扩展的通用视频表征学习路径。

Conclusion: 两阶段潜世界建模方法有效平衡像素保真度与语义抽象，为视频理解提供了新架构方向和技术路径。

Abstract: Large-scale video-text pretraining achieves strong performance but depends on noisy, synthetic captions with limited semantic coverage, often overlooking implicit world knowledge such as object motion, 3D geometry, and physical cues. In contrast, masked video modeling (MVM) directly exploits spatiotemporal structures but trails text-supervised methods on general tasks. We find this gap arises from overlooked architectural issues: pixel-level reconstruction struggles with convergence and its low-level requirement often conflicts with semantics, while latent prediction often encourages shortcut learning. To address these, we disentangle the traditional encoder-decoder design into an Encoder-Predictor-Decoder (EPD) framework, where the predictor acts as a latent world model, and propose InternVideo-Next, a two-stage pretraining scheme that builds a semantically consistent yet detail-preserving latent space for this world model. First, conventional linear decoder in pixel MVM enforces the predictor output latent to be linearly projected to, thus separable in pixel space, causing the conflict with semantic abstraction. Our Stage 1 proposes a conditional diffusion decoder and injects reliable image-level semantic priors to enhance semantics and convergence, thus bridging pixel-level fidelity with high-level semantic abstraction. Stage 2 further learns world knowledge by predicting frozen Stage 1 targets within this space, mitigating shortcut learning. Trained on public, unlabeled videos, InternVideo-Next achieves state-of-the-art results across benchmarks and provides a scalable path toward general video representation learning.

Abstract: Despite considerable progress in handwritten text recognition, paragraph-level handwritten text recognition, especially in low-resource languages, such as Hindi, Urdu and similar scripts, remains a challenging problem. These languages, often lacking comprehensive linguistic resources, require special attention to develop robust systems for accurate optical character recognition (OCR). This paper introduces BharatOCR, a novel segmentation-free paragraph-level handwritten Hindi and Urdu text recognition. We propose a ViT-Transformer Decoder-LM architecture for handwritten text recognition, where a Vision Transformer (ViT) extracts visual features, a Transformer decoder generates text sequences, and a pre-trained language model (LM) refines the output to improve accuracy, fluency, and coherence. Our model utilizes a Data-efficient Image Transformer (DeiT) model proposed for masked image modeling in this research work. In addition, we adopt a RoBERTa architecture optimized for masked language modeling (MLM) to enhance the linguistic comprehension and generative capabilities of the proposed model. The transformer decoder generates text sequences from visual embeddings. This model is designed to iteratively process a paragraph image line by line, called implicit line segmentation. The proposed model was evaluated using our custom dataset ('Parimal Urdu') and ('Parimal Hindi'), introduced in this research work, as well as two public datasets. The proposed model achieved benchmark results in the NUST-UHWR, PUCIT-OUHL, and Parimal-Urdu datasets, achieving character recognition rates of 96.24%, 92.05%, and 94.80%, respectively. The model also provided benchmark results using the Hindi dataset achieving a character recognition rate of 80.64%. The results obtained from our proposed model indicated that it outperformed several state-of-the-art Urdu text recognition methods.

Conclusion: OpenBox通过解耦实例关联与状态感知标注流程，为开放词汇3D检测提供了高效且可扩展的自动化标注方案。

Abstract: Unsupervised and open-vocabulary 3D object detection has recently gained attention, particularly in autonomous driving, where reducing annotation costs and recognizing unseen objects are critical for both safety and scalability. However, most existing approaches uniformly annotate 3D bounding boxes, ignore objects' physical states, and require multiple self-training iterations for annotation refinement, resulting in suboptimal quality and substantial computational overhead. To address these challenges, we propose OpenBox, a two-stage automatic annotation pipeline that leverages a 2D vision foundation model. In the first stage, OpenBox associates instance-level cues from 2D images processed by a vision foundation model with the corresponding 3D point clouds via cross-modal instance alignment. In the second stage, it categorizes instances by rigidity and motion state, then generates adaptive bounding boxes with class-specific size statistics. As a result, OpenBox produces high-quality 3D bounding box annotations without requiring self-training. Experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset, the Lyft Level 5 Perception dataset, and the nuScenes dataset demonstrate improved accuracy and efficiency over baselines.

Abstract: Failing to be aware of speeding vehicles approaching from behind poses a huge threat to the road safety of pedestrians and cyclists. In this paper, we propose BlinkBud, which utilizes a single earbud and a paired phone to online detect hazardous objects approaching from behind of a user. The core idea is to accurately track visually identified objects utilizing a small number of sampled camera images taken from the earbud. To minimize the power consumption of the earbud and the phone while guaranteeing the best tracking accuracy, a novel 3D object tracking algorithm is devised, integrating both a Kalman filter based trajectory estimation scheme and an optimal image sampling strategy based on reinforcement learning. Moreover, the impact of constant user head movements on the tracking accuracy is significantly eliminated by leveraging the estimated pitch and yaw angles to correct the object depth estimation and align the camera coordinate system to the user's body coordinate system, respectively. We implement a prototype BlinkBud system and conduct extensive real-world experiments. Results show that BlinkBud is lightweight with ultra-low mean power consumptions of 29.8 mW and 702.6 mW on the earbud and smartphone, respectively, and can accurately detect hazards with a low average false positive ratio (FPR) and false negative ratio (FNR) of 4.90% and 1.47%, respectively.

Abstract: 3D generation and reconstruction techniques have been widely used in computer games, film, and other content creation areas. As the application grows, there is a growing demand for 3D shapes that look truly realistic. Traditional evaluation methods rely on a ground truth to measure mesh fidelity. However, in many practical cases, a shape's realism does not depend on having a ground truth reference. In this work, we propose a Shape-Realism Alignment Metric that leverages a large language model (LLM) as a bridge between mesh shape information and realism evaluation. To achieve this, we adopt a mesh encoding approach that converts 3D shapes into the language token space. A dedicated realism decoder is designed to align the language model's output with human perception of realism. Additionally, we introduce a new dataset, RealismGrading, which provides human-annotated realism scores without the need for ground truth shapes. Our dataset includes shapes generated by 16 different algorithms on over a dozen objects, making it more representative of practical 3D shape distributions. We validate our metric's performance and generalizability through k-fold cross-validation across different objects. Experimental results show that our metric correlates well with human perceptions and outperforms existing methods, and has good generalizability.

Conclusion: TGE通过直接分析3D网格并融入真实失真数据集，显著提升保真度评估与人类感知的一致性，解决了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Textured high-fidelity 3D models are crucial for games, AR/VR, and film, but human-aligned evaluation methods still fall behind despite recent advances in 3D reconstruction and generation. Existing metrics, such as Chamfer Distance, often fail to align with how humans evaluate the fidelity of 3D shapes. Recent learning-based metrics attempt to improve this by relying on rendered images and 2D image quality metrics. However, these approaches face limitations due to incomplete structural coverage and sensitivity to viewpoint choices. Moreover, most methods are trained on synthetic distortions, which differ significantly from real-world distortions, resulting in a domain gap. To address these challenges, we propose a new fidelity evaluation method that is based directly on 3D meshes with texture, without relying on rendering. Our method, named Textured Geometry Evaluation TGE, jointly uses the geometry and color information to calculate the fidelity of the input textured mesh with comparison to a reference colored shape. To train and evaluate our metric, we design a human-annotated dataset with real-world distortions. Experiments show that TGE outperforms rendering-based and geometry-only methods on real-world distortion dataset.

Abstract: Exemplar-guided Image Editing (EIE) aims to modify a source image according to a visual reference. Existing approaches often require large-scale pre-training to learn relationships between the source and reference images, incurring high computational costs. As a training-free alternative, inversion techniques can be used to map the source image into a latent space for manipulation. However, our empirical study reveals that standard inversion is sub-optimal for EIE, leading to poor quality and inefficiency. To tackle this challenge, we introduce \textbf{Reversible Inversion ({ReInversion})} for effective and efficient EIE. Specifically, ReInversion operates as a two-stage denoising process, which is first conditioned on the source image and subsequently on the reference. Besides, we introduce a Mask-Guided Selective Denoising (MSD) strategy to constrain edits to target regions, preserving the structural consistency of the background. Both qualitative and quantitative comparisons demonstrate that our ReInversion method achieves state-of-the-art EIE performance with the lowest computational overhead.

*Yunze Liu,Zifan Wang,Peiran Wu,Jiayang Ao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PointNet4D is a lightweight 4D backbone network that combines a Hybrid Mamba-Transformer temporal fusion block and a 4DMAP pretraining strategy to efficiently process streaming point cloud video in real-time. It achieves consistent improvements across 9 tasks on 7 datasets and enables advanced robotic applications like 4D Diffusion Policy and 4D Imitation Learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 4D processing methods (e.g., spatiotemporal convolutions and Transformers) are computationally intensive, making them unsuitable for resource-constrained real-time applications like robotics. PointNet4D addresses these limitations by optimizing efficiency while maintaining temporal understanding.

Method: The core innovation is a Hybrid Mamba-Transformer block that integrates the computational efficiency of Mamba’s state-space modeling with the bidirectional capabilities of Transformers. Additionally, 4DMAP, a frame-wise masked auto-regressive pretraining strategy, enhances temporal modeling by capturing motion cues across frames.

Result: Evaluated on 9 tasks across 7 datasets, PointNet4D demonstrated consistent performance improvements in both online and offline scenarios. When applied to robotic systems (4D Diffusion Policy and 4D Imitation Learning), it outperformed benchmarks on RoboTwin and HandoverSim, proving its practical utility.

Conclusion: PointNet4D effectively balances computational efficiency and temporal modeling for real-time 4D point cloud processing. Its hybrid architecture and pretraining strategy advance robotic applications requiring dynamic 4D environment understanding under resource constraints.

Abstract: Understanding dynamic 4D environments-3D space evolving over time-is critical for robotic and interactive systems. These applications demand systems that can process streaming point cloud video in real-time, often under resource constraints, while also benefiting from past and present observations when available. However, current 4D backbone networks rely heavily on spatiotemporal convolutions and Transformers, which are often computationally intensive and poorly suited to real-time applications. We propose PointNet4D, a lightweight 4D backbone optimized for both online and offline settings. At its core is a Hybrid Mamba-Transformer temporal fusion block, which integrates the efficient state-space modeling of Mamba and the bidirectional modeling power of Transformers. This enables PointNet4D to handle variable-length online sequences efficiently across different deployment scenarios. To enhance temporal understanding, we introduce 4DMAP, a frame-wise masked auto-regressive pretraining strategy that captures motion cues across frames. Our extensive evaluations across 9 tasks on 7 datasets, demonstrating consistent improvements across diverse domains. We further demonstrate PointNet4D's utility by building two robotic application systems: 4D Diffusion Policy and 4D Imitation Learning, achieving substantial gains on the RoboTwin and HandoverSim benchmarks.

TL;DR: 本研究提出RICE-VL（东南亚文化视觉语言理解基准）和SEA-LAVE评估指标，揭示现有视觉语言模型存在西方中心主义偏见，在东南亚文化理解场景中存在显著性能缺陷


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在东南亚多文化场景中表现受限，主要受西方文化偏见影响，需要系统性评估框架来推动包容性模型发展

Method: 构建包含28,000+多模态样本（含真值判断/填空/开放问答）和1,000组图像定位标注的RICE-VL基准，开发融合文化对齐度和地域识别能力的SEA-LAVE评估体系，并进行多模型跨文化能力测试

Result: 6个主流模型测试显示：1）低资源国家任务准确率下降23.7% 2）抽象文化概念识别F1值低于0.4 3）视觉定位任务平均IoU仅为0.32，表明模型对文化符号的空间理解存在显著缺陷

Conclusion: 揭示VLMs在多文化场景的理解局限性，证明需要构建覆盖文化多样性的训练数据和评估体系，推动开发真正全球化的AI系统

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel in multimodal tasks but often exhibit Western-centric biases, limiting their effectiveness in culturally diverse regions like Southeast Asia (SEA). To address this, we introduce RICE-VL, a novel benchmark evaluating VLM cultural understanding across 11 ASEAN countries. RICE-VL includes over 28,000 human-curated Visual Question Answering (VQA) samples -- covering True or False, Fill-in-the-Blank, and open-ended formats -- and 1,000 image-bounding box pairs for Visual Grounding, annotated by culturally informed experts across 14 sub-ground categories. We propose SEA-LAVE, an extension of the LAVE metric, assessing textual accuracy, cultural alignment, and country identification. Evaluations of six open- and closed-source VLMs reveal significant performance gaps in low-resource countries and abstract cultural domains. The Visual Grounding task tests models' ability to localize culturally significant elements in complex scenes, probing spatial and contextual accuracy. RICE-VL exposes limitations in VLMs' cultural comprehension and highlights the need for inclusive model development to better serve diverse global populations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了MDiff4STR，一种针对场景文本识别（STR）任务改进的掩码扩散模型（MDM），通过两种关键策略在保持高效推理的同时提升准确率，克服了传统MDM在STR任务中准确率不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管掩码扩散模型（MDM）在视觉-语言任务中具有效率与准确率的平衡优势，但其在场景文本识别（STR）任务中的表现尚未被探索。传统MDM在STR任务中准确率落后于自回归模型（ARM），且存在训练与推理阶段的noising差距及过自信预测问题，需针对性改进。

Method: 1) 提出六种noising策略，减少训练与推理阶段的分布差异；2) 设计token-replacement噪声机制，引入非掩码类型噪声以抑制过自信预测，促使模型修正错误。

Result: 在标准及复杂STR基准数据集（涵盖不规则、艺术化、遮挡文本及中文）上，MDiff4STR在无需预训练的情况下均超越主流STR模型，在仅需3步去噪的情况下准确率超越现有ARM，且推理速度更快。

Conclusion: 该研究证实了MDM在STR任务中的潜力，通过针对性设计的噪声策略，成功实现效率与准确率的同步优化，为扩散模型在文本识别领域的应用提供了新方向。

Abstract: Mask Diffusion Models (MDMs) have recently emerged as a promising alternative to auto-regressive models (ARMs) for vision-language tasks, owing to their flexible balance of efficiency and accuracy. In this paper, for the first time, we introduce MDMs into the Scene Text Recognition (STR) task. We show that vanilla MDM lags behind ARMs in terms of accuracy, although it improves recognition efficiency. To bridge this gap, we propose MDiff4STR, a Mask Diffusion model enhanced with two key improvement strategies tailored for STR. Specifically, we identify two key challenges in applying MDMs to STR: noising gap between training and inference, and overconfident predictions during inference. Both significantly hinder the performance of MDMs. To mitigate the first issue, we develop six noising strategies that better align training with inference behavior. For the second, we propose a token-replacement noise mechanism that provides a non-mask noise type, encouraging the model to reconsider and revise overly confident but incorrect predictions. We conduct extensive evaluations of MDiff4STR on both standard and challenging STR benchmarks, covering diverse scenarios including irregular, artistic, occluded, and Chinese text, as well as whether the use of pretraining. Across these settings, MDiff4STR consistently outperforms popular STR models, surpassing state-of-the-art ARMs in accuracy, while maintaining fast inference with only three denoising steps.

Conclusion: ViRectify为MLLMs视频推理评估提供新方向，通过显式纠正错误传播与时效分析可增强小模型竞争力，揭示了当前模型的关键短板。

Abstract: As multimodal large language models (MLLMs) frequently exhibit errors in complex video reasoning scenarios, correcting these errors is critical for uncovering their weaknesses and improving performance. However, existing benchmarks lack systematic evaluation of MLLMs' ability to identify and correct these video reasoning errors. To bridge this gap, we propose \textit{ViRectify}, a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate their fine-grained correction capability. Through an AI-assisted annotation pipeline with human verification, we construct a dataset of over 30\textit{K} instances spanning dynamic perception, scientific reasoning, and embodied decision-making domains. In \textit{ViRectify}, we challenge MLLMs to perform step-wise error identification and generate rationales with key video evidence grounding. In addition, we further propose the trajectory evidence-driven correction framework, comprising step-wise error trajectory and reward modeling on visual evidence-grounded correction. It encourages the model to explicitly concentrate on error propagation and key timestamps for correction. Extensive evaluation across 16 advanced MLLMs demonstrates that our \textit{ViRectify} serves as a challenging testbed, where GPT-5 achieves only 31.94\% correction accuracy. Our framework enables a Qwen2.5-VL-7B to consistently outperform the variants of 72B on \textit{ViRectify}, showing the effectiveness of our approach. Further analysis uncovers systematic asymmetries in error correction across models, and our dataset is also a valuable data resource to perform reflection learning. We believe \textit{ViRectify} provides a new direction for comprehensively evaluating the advanced MLLMs in video reasoning.

TL;DR: ResDiT是一种无需训练的高分辨率图像生成方法，通过优化位置编码和局部增强机制，有效解决DiT模型在超分辨率下的布局坍塌和纹理失真问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖复杂的分阶段生成流程解决DiT模型高分辨率崩溃问题，而本文旨在通过分析模型内部机制（尤其是位置编码错误），提出更高效的端到端解决方案。

Method: 1) 提出位置编码缩放技术纠正高分辨率下位置信息错误；2) 设计基于局部注意力的细节增强模块；3) 开发高斯加权拼接策略与全局-局部特征融合机制，消除网格伪影。

Conclusion: ResDiT通过架构级改进为现有DiT模型提供通用的分辨率扩展能力，在保持训练免费特性的同时，大幅简化高分辨率扩散模型流水线。

Abstract: Leveraging pre-trained Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) for high-resolution (HR) image synthesis often leads to spatial layout collapse and degraded texture fidelity. Prior work mitigates these issues with complex pipelines that first perform a base-resolution (i.e., training-resolution) denoising process to guide HR generation. We instead explore the intrinsic generative mechanisms of DiTs and propose ResDiT, a training-free method that scales resolution efficiently. We identify the core factor governing spatial layout, position embeddings (PEs), and show that the original PEs encode incorrect positional information when extrapolated to HR, which triggers layout collapse. To address this, we introduce a PE scaling technique that rectifies positional encoding under resolution changes. To further remedy low-fidelity details, we develop a local-enhancement mechanism grounded in base-resolution local attention. We design a patch-level fusion module that aggregates global and local cues, together with a Gaussian-weighted splicing strategy that eliminates grid artifacts. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that ResDiT consistently delivers high-fidelity, high-resolution image synthesis and integrates seamlessly with downstream tasks, including spatially controlled generation.

Conclusion: Clipomaly通过CLIP的开放词汇特性与动态推理机制，解决了自动驾驶中开放世界场景的异常感知与语义理解难题。

Abstract: Open-world and anomaly segmentation methods seek to enable autonomous driving systems to detect and segment both known and unknown objects in real-world scenes. However, existing methods do not assign semantically meaningful labels to unknown regions, and distinguishing and learning representations for unknown classes remains difficult. While open-vocabulary segmentation methods show promise in generalizing to novel classes, they require a fixed inference vocabulary and thus cannot be directly applied to anomaly segmentation where unknown classes are unconstrained. We propose Clipomaly, the first CLIP-based open-world and anomaly segmentation method for autonomous driving. Our zero-shot approach requires no anomaly-specific training data and leverages CLIP's shared image-text embedding space to both segment unknown objects and assign human-interpretable names to them. Unlike open-vocabulary methods, our model dynamically extends its vocabulary at inference time without retraining, enabling robust detection and naming of anomalies beyond common class definitions such as those in Cityscapes. Clipomaly achieves state-of-the-art performance on established anomaly segmentation benchmarks while providing interpretability and flexibility essential for practical deployment.

Conclusion: 该框架有效缓解了模板构建与变形缺陷，显著提升3D人体动画的真实性和计算效率

Abstract: 3D human avatar animation aims at transforming a human avatar from an arbitrary initial pose to a specified target pose using deformation algorithms. Existing approaches typically divide this task into two stages: canonical template construction and target pose deformation. However, current template construction methods demand extensive skeletal rigging and often produce artifacts for specific poses. Moreover, target pose deformation suffers from structural distortions caused by Linear Blend Skinning (LBS), which significantly undermines animation realism. To address these problems, we propose a unified learning-based framework to address both challenges in two phases. For the former phase, to overcome the inefficiencies and artifacts during template construction, we leverage a U-Net architecture that decouples texture and pose information in a feed-forward process, enabling fast generation of a human template. For the latter phase, we propose a data-driven refinement technique that enhances structural integrity. Extensive experiments show that our model delivers consistent performance across diverse poses with an optimal balance between efficiency and quality,surpassing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

Abstract: Although prevailing camera-controlled video generation models can produce cinematic results, lifting them directly to the generation of 3D-consistent and high-fidelity time-synchronized multi-view videos remains challenging, which is a pivotal capability for taming 4D worlds. Some works resort to data augmentation or test-time optimization, but these strategies are constrained by limited model generalization and scalability issues. To this end, we propose ChronosObserver, a training-free method including World State Hyperspace to represent the spatiotemporal constraints of a 4D world scene, and Hyperspace Guided Sampling to synchronize the diffusion sampling trajectories of multiple views using the hyperspace. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves high-fidelity and 3D-consistent time-synchronized multi-view videos generation without training or fine-tuning for diffusion models.

It is used to design a bi-level minimization approach to automatically extract curves and 1D structures from an image, which is mostly unsupervised. We extend then the method to curvature-dependent energies, using a now classical lifting of the curves in the space of positions and orientations equipped with an appropriate sub-Riemanian or Finslerian metric.

Conclusion: 该框架通过物理图像与多模态融合实现可迁移量子建模，开源数据集/代码推动领域发展。

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in molecular and materials machine learning, most models still lack physical transferability: they fit correlations across whole molecules or crystals rather than learning the quantum interactions between atomic pairs. Yet bonding, charge redistribution, orbital hybridization, and electronic coupling all emerge from these two-body interactions that define local quantum fields in many-body systems. We introduce QuantumCanvas, a large-scale multimodal benchmark that treats two-body quantum systems as foundational units of matter. The dataset spans 2,850 element-element pairs, each annotated with 18 electronic, thermodynamic, and geometric properties and paired with ten-channel image representations derived from l- and m-resolved orbital densities, angular field transforms, co-occupancy maps, and charge-density projections. These physically grounded images encode spatial, angular, and electrostatic symmetries without explicit coordinates, providing an interpretable visual modality for quantum learning. Benchmarking eight architectures across 18 targets, we report mean absolute errors of 0.201 eV on energy gap using GATv2, 0.265 eV on HOMO and 0.274 eV on LUMO using EGNN. For energy-related quantities, DimeNet attains 2.27 eV total-energy MAE and 0.132 eV repulsive-energy MAE, while a multimodal fusion model achieves a 2.15 eV Mermin free-energy MAE. Pretraining on QuantumCanvas further improves convergence stability and generalization when fine-tuned on larger datasets such as QM9, MD17, and CrysMTM. By unifying orbital physics with vision-based representation learning, QuantumCanvas provides a principled and interpretable basis for learning transferable quantum interactions through coupled visual and numerical modalities. Dataset and model implementations are available at https://github.com/KurbanIntelligenceLab/QuantumCanvas.

Conclusion: DFS通过模糊系统与多路径扩散的有机结合，显著提升了复杂场景下的图像生成质量与效率，为异构特征建模提供了可扩展的框架

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a leading technique for generating images due to their ability to create high-resolution and realistic images. Despite their strong performance, diffusion models still struggle in managing image collections with significant feature differences. They often fail to capture complex features and produce conflicting results. Research has attempted to address this issue by learning different regions of an image through multiple diffusion paths and then combining them. However, this approach leads to inefficient coordination among multiple paths and high computational costs. To tackle these issues, this paper presents a Diffusion Fuzzy System (DFS), a latent-space multi-path diffusion model guided by fuzzy rules. DFS offers several advantages. First, unlike traditional multi-path diffusion methods, DFS uses multiple diffusion paths, each dedicated to learning a specific class of image features. By assigning each path to a different feature type, DFS overcomes the limitations of multi-path models in capturing heterogeneous image features. Second, DFS employs rule-chain-based reasoning to dynamically steer the diffusion process and enable efficient coordination among multiple paths. Finally, DFS introduces a fuzzy membership-based latent-space compression mechanism to reduce the computational costs of multi-path diffusion effectively. We tested our method on three public datasets: LSUN Bedroom, LSUN Church, and MS COCO. The results show that DFS achieves more stable training and faster convergence than existing single-path and multi-path diffusion models. Additionally, DFS surpasses baseline models in both image quality and alignment between text and images, and also shows improved accuracy when comparing generated images to target references.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a large-scale benchmark for unsupervised anomaly detection in brain MRI, revealing algorithmic limitations and biases in current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inconsistent evaluation standards in unsupervised anomaly detection for brain MRI by establishing a multi-center, standardized benchmark for clinical translation.

Method: A comprehensive dataset of 5,948 brain scans from healthy and clinical cohorts across six scanners was used to evaluate deep learning algorithms, focusing on segmentation performance, robustness under distributional shifts, and demographic/scanner-related biases.

Result: Reconstruction-based methods (e.g., diffusion-inspired) outperformed in lesion segmentation (Dice 0.03–0.65 range), but all algorithms showed scanner-related biases, missed small lesions, and demographic-dependent false positives, with limited improvement from larger training datasets.

Conclusion: Current unsupervised anomaly detection frameworks are algorithmically constrained and require advances in pretraining, deviation measures, fairness-aware modeling, and domain adaptation for clinical deployment.

Abstract: Deep unsupervised anomaly detection in brain magnetic resonance imaging offers a promising route to identify pathological deviations without requiring lesion-specific annotations. Yet, fragmented evaluations, heterogeneous datasets, and inconsistent metrics have hindered progress toward clinical translation. Here, we present a large-scale, multi-center benchmark of deep unsupervised anomaly detection for brain imaging. The training cohort comprised 2,976 T1 and 2,972 T2-weighted scans from healthy individuals across six scanners, with ages ranging from 6 to 89 years. Validation used 92 scans to tune hyperparameters and estimate unbiased thresholds. Testing encompassed 2,221 T1w and 1,262 T2w scans spanning healthy datasets and diverse clinical cohorts. Across all algorithms, the Dice-based segmentation performance varied between 0.03 and 0.65, indicating substantial variability. To assess robustness, we systematically evaluated the impact of different scanners, lesion types and sizes, as well as demographics (age, sex). Reconstruction-based methods, particularly diffusion-inspired approaches, achieved the strongest lesion segmentation performance, while feature-based methods showed greater robustness under distributional shifts. However, systematic biases, such as scanner-related effects, were observed for the majority of algorithms, including that small and low-contrast lesions were missed more often, and that false positives varied with age and sex. Increasing healthy training data yields only modest gains, underscoring that current unsupervised anomaly detection frameworks are limited algorithmically rather than by data availability. Our benchmark establishes a transparent foundation for future research and highlights priorities for clinical translation, including image native pretraining, principled deviation measures, fairness-aware modeling, and robust domain adaptation.

Result: 在重建精度与VGGT相当的情况下,处理1000张图像时推理时间仅为VGGT的9.3%,并可扩展至处理超过3000张图像的序列。

Conclusion: 基于描述符的注意力机制可有效解决视觉注意力模型的可扩展性瓶颈,块递归机制为长序列实时处理提供了新思路。

Abstract: 3D reconstruction from multi-view images is a core challenge in computer vision. Recently, feed-forward methods have emerged as efficient and robust alternatives to traditional per-scene optimization techniques. Among them, state-of-the-art models like the Visual Geometry Grounding Transformer (VGGT) leverage full self-attention over all image tokens to capture global relationships. However, this approach suffers from poor scalability due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention and the large number of tokens generated in long image sequences. In this work, we introduce FlashVGGT, an efficient alternative that addresses this bottleneck through a descriptor-based attention mechanism. Instead of applying dense global attention across all tokens, FlashVGGT compresses spatial information from each frame into a compact set of descriptor tokens. Global attention is then computed as cross-attention between the full set of image tokens and this smaller descriptor set, significantly reducing computational overhead. Moreover, the compactness of the descriptors enables online inference over long sequences via a chunk-recursive mechanism that reuses cached descriptors from previous chunks. Experimental results show that FlashVGGT achieves reconstruction accuracy competitive with VGGT while reducing inference time to just 9.3% of VGGT for 1,000 images, and scaling efficiently to sequences exceeding 3,000 images.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce RoleMotion, a large-scale human motion dataset that encompasses a wealth of role-playing and functional motion data tailored to fit various specific scenes. Existing text datasets are mainly constructed decentrally as amalgamation of assorted subsets that their data are nonfunctional and isolated to work together to cover social activities in various scenes. Also, the quality of motion data is inconsistent, and textual annotation lacks fine-grained details in these datasets. In contrast, RoleMotion is meticulously designed and collected with a particular focus on scenes and roles. The dataset features 25 classic scenes, 110 functional roles, over 500 behaviors, and 10296 high-quality human motion sequences of body and hands, annotated with 27831 fine-grained text descriptions. We build an evaluator stronger than existing counterparts, prove its reliability, and evaluate various text-to-motion methods on our dataset. Finally, we explore the interplay of motion generation of body and hands. Experimental results demonstrate the high-quality and functionality of our dataset on text-driven whole-body generation.

Conclusion: 所提形态敏感深度匹配方法突破传统时移校正局限，为多极板测井成像数据融合提供了更优解决方案，其特征扩展框架支持针对特殊储层定制优化。

Abstract: In well logging operations using the oil-based mud (OBM) microresistivity imager, which employs an interleaved design with upper and lower pad sets, depth misalignment issues persist between the pad images even after velocity correction. This paper presents a depth matching method for borehole images based on the Shape Dynamic Time Warping (ShapeDTW) algorithm. The method extracts local shape features to construct a morphologically sensitive distance matrix, better preserving structural similarity between sequences during alignment. We implement this by employing a combined feature set of the one-dimensional Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG1D) and the original signal as the shape descriptor. Field test examples demonstrate that our method achieves precise alignment for images with complex textures, depth shifts, or local scaling. Furthermore, it provides a flexible framework for feature extension, allowing the integration of other descriptors tailored to specific geological features.

Abstract: Articulated 3D objects are critical for embodied AI, robotics, and interactive scene understanding, yet creating simulation-ready assets remains labor-intensive and requires expert modeling of part hierarchies and motion structures. We introduce SPARK, a framework for reconstructing physically consistent, kinematic part-level articulated objects from a single RGB image. Given an input image, we first leverage VLMs to extract coarse URDF parameters and generate part-level reference images. We then integrate the part-image guidance and the inferred structure graph into a generative diffusion transformer to synthesize consistent part and complete shapes of articulated objects. To further refine the URDF parameters, we incorporate differentiable forward kinematics and differentiable rendering to optimize joint types, axes, and origins under VLM-generated open-state supervision. Extensive experiments show that SPARK produces high-quality, simulation-ready articulated assets across diverse categories, enabling downstream applications such as robotic manipulation and interaction modeling.

TL;DR: 提出Fusion-Diff框架通过多模态融合与轻量Control-Adapter解决零样本组合图像检索中的模态差距问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有监督CIR方法依赖昂贵标注数据，而传统零样本方法在文本-图像对齐和数据利用效率上存在显着缺陷

Method: 1) 在联合视觉-语言空间中引入多模态融合特征编辑策略以缩小模态差异 2) 设计轻量级Control-Adapter模块，通过仅20万样本的合成数据微调即可实现高效数据利用

Conclusion: Fusion-Diff通过创新的多模态融合机制和高效训练框架，建立了零样本CIR的新范式，为跨模态检索提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) enables fine-grained visual search by combining a reference image with a textual modification. While supervised CIR methods achieve high accuracy, their reliance on costly triplet annotations motivates zero-shot solutions. The core challenge in zero-shot CIR (ZS-CIR) stems from a fundamental dilemma: existing text-centric or diffusion-based approaches struggle to effectively bridge the vision-language modality gap. To address this, we propose Fusion-Diff, a novel generative editing framework with high effectiveness and data efficiency designed for multimodal alignment. First, it introduces a multimodal fusion feature editing strategy within a joint vision-language (VL) space, substantially narrowing the modality gap. Second, to maximize data efficiency, the framework incorporates a lightweight Control-Adapter, enabling state-of-the-art performance through fine-tuning on only a limited-scale synthetic dataset of 200K samples. Extensive experiments on standard CIR benchmarks (CIRR, FashionIQ, and CIRCO) demonstrate that Fusion-Diff significantly outperforms prior zero-shot approaches. We further enhance the interpretability of our model by visualizing the fused multimodal representations.

TL;DR: 本论文提出ViT³，一种改进的视觉测试时训练模型，通过系统实证研究解决视觉序列建模中的设计挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管TTT在序列建模中具有潜力，但视觉任务中的内在模块和训练策略缺乏系统性设计原则，亟需实证研究填补这一空白。

Method: 通过系统性实验和分析提炼出六个设计启示，开发纯TTT架构ViT³，并在多个视觉任务中进行验证。

Result: ViT³在图像分类、生成、检测和分割任务中表现优异，达到或超越Mamba等线性复杂度模型性能，缩小与优化视觉Transformer的差距。

Conclusion: 研究为视觉TTT提供了可复用的设计范式和基准模型，证实了TTT架构的实用性，并指明了未来优化方向。

Abstract: Test-Time Training (TTT) has recently emerged as a promising direction for efficient sequence modeling. TTT reformulates attention operation as an online learning problem, constructing a compact inner model from key-value pairs at test time. This reformulation opens a rich and flexible design space while achieving linear computational complexity. However, crafting a powerful visual TTT design remains challenging: fundamental choices for the inner module and inner training lack comprehensive understanding and practical guidelines. To bridge this critical gap, in this paper, we present a systematic empirical study of TTT designs for visual sequence modeling. From a series of experiments and analyses, we distill six practical insights that establish design principles for effective visual TTT and illuminate paths for future improvement. These findings culminate in the Vision Test-Time Training (ViT$^3$) model, a pure TTT architecture that achieves linear complexity and parallelizable computation. We evaluate ViT$^3$ across diverse visual tasks, including image classification, image generation, object detection, and semantic segmentation. Results show that ViT$^3$ consistently matches or outperforms advanced linear-complexity models (e.g., Mamba and linear attention variants) and effectively narrows the gap to highly optimized vision Transformers. We hope this study and the ViT$^3$ baseline can facilitate future work on visual TTT models. Code is available at https://github.com/LeapLabTHU/ViTTT.

### [152] [DB-KAUNet: An Adaptive Dual Branch Kolmogorov-Arnold UNet for Retinal Vessel Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01657)
*Hongyu Xu,Panpan Meng,Meng Wang,Dayu Hu,Liming Liang,Xiaoqi Sheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种用于视网膜血管分割的自适应双分支Kolmogorov-Arnold U-Net（DB-KAUNet），通过结合CNN和Transformer的异构双分支编码器及特征增强模块，在三个公开数据集上实现了领先的分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CNN方法在视网膜血管分割中受限于长程依赖关系和复杂非线性关系建模，需开发更优模型以提升临床诊断相关疾病的准确性。

Method: 设计异构双分支编码器（HDBE）并行CNN与Transformer路径，交替集成KANConv/KAT模块；嵌入跨分支通道交互（CCI）模块和自适应融合的空间特征增强（SFE-GAF）模块，通过自适应采样精确聚焦血管形态。

Conclusion: DB-KAUNet通过多模态分支融合与自适应特征增强机制，为医学图像分割提供了新颖且高效的技术框架，具有明确的临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of retinal vessels is crucial for the clinical diagnosis of numerous ophthalmic and systemic diseases. However, traditional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) methods exhibit inherent limitations, struggling to capture long-range dependencies and complex nonlinear relationships. To address the above limitations, an Adaptive Dual Branch Kolmogorov-Arnold UNet (DB-KAUNet) is proposed for retinal vessel segmentation. In DB-KAUNet, we design a Heterogeneous Dual-Branch Encoder (HDBE) that features parallel CNN and Transformer pathways. The HDBE strategically interleaves standard CNN and Transformer blocks with novel KANConv and KAT blocks, enabling the model to form a comprehensive feature representation. To optimize feature processing, we integrate several critical components into the HDBE. First, a Cross-Branch Channel Interaction (CCI) module is embedded to facilitate efficient interaction of channel features between the parallel pathways. Second, an attention-based Spatial Feature Enhancement (SFE) module is employed to enhance spatial features and fuse the outputs from both branches. Building upon the SFE module, an advanced Spatial Feature Enhancement with Geometrically Adaptive Fusion (SFE-GAF) module is subsequently developed. In the SFE-GAF module, adaptive sampling is utilized to focus on true vessel morphology precisely. The adaptive process strengthens salient vascular features while significantly reducing background noise and computational overhead. Extensive experiments on the DRIVE, STARE, and CHASE_DB1 datasets validate that DB-KAUNet achieves leading segmentation performance and demonstrates exceptional robustness.

TL;DR: 提出ScaleBridge-Det框架，通过REM模块和DGQ模块解决遥感图像中多尺度微小物体检测难题，首次实现跨尺度均衡性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理遥感图像的极端尺度差异和密度分布时存在性能失衡问题，大型基础模型难以适配微小物体检测。传统MoE模型存在尺度偏好，无法有效融合多尺度特征。

Method: 1) 提出REM模块：通过路由增强的混合注意力机制动态融合尺度专家特征，解决尺度偏倚问题；2) 提出DGQ模块：基于密度预测动态调整查询位置和数量，实现跨尺度资源优化分配。

Conclusion: 首次验证大规模模型在微小物体跨尺度检测的可行性，提出双模块协同机制突破传统检测框架的尺度约束，为遥感应用提供新范式。

Abstract: Tiny object detection in remote sensing imagery has attracted significant research interest in recent years. Despite recent progress, achieving balanced detection performance across diverse object scales remains a formidable challenge, particularly in scenarios where dense tiny objects and large objects coexist. Although large foundation models have revolutionized general vision tasks, their application to tiny object detection remains unexplored due to the extreme scale variation and density distribution inherent to remote sensing imagery. To bridge this scale gap, we propose ScaleBridge-Det, to the best of our knowledge, the first large detection framework designed for tiny objects, which could achieve balanced performance across diverse scales through scale-adaptive expert routing and density-guided query allocation. Specifically, we introduce a Routing-Enhanced Mixture Attention (REM) module that dynamically selects and fuses scale-specific expert features via adaptive routing to address the tendency of standard MoE models to favor dominant scales. REM generates complementary and discriminative multi-scale representations suitable for both tiny and large objects. Furthermore, we present a Density-Guided Dynamic Query (DGQ) module that predicts object density to adaptively adjust query positions and numbers, enabling efficient resource allocation for objects of varying scales. The proposed framework allows ScaleBridge-Det to simultaneously optimize performance for both dense tiny and general objects without trade-offs. Extensive experiments on benchmark and cross-domain datasets demonstrate that ScaleBridge-Det achieves state-of-the-art performance on AI-TOD-V2 and DTOD, while exhibiting superior cross-domain robustness on VisDrone.

TL;DR: 提出了GRASP方法解决扩散模型在长尾分布数据中生成效果不佳的问题，通过残差适配器提升罕见类别的生成质量和多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在罕见病理（长尾数据）生成任务中存在模式崩溃问题，头类与尾类的梯度冲突导致生成质量与多样性不足，且传统方法仅调整推理过程而未修正学习分布。

Method: 基于外部先验将样本聚类为梯度冲突最小的簇，向Transformer前馈层注入簇特定残差适配器，跳过原模型门控机制，在预训练模型上实现稳定高效微调。

Result: 在MIMIC-CXR-LT和ImageNet-LT数据集上，GRASP在FID和多样性指标（尤其实部）均优于基线方法，同时提升NIH-CXR-LT尾部标签的下游分类效果。

Conclusion: 该方法计算轻量级、可扩展，能够与扩散模型流程无缝集成，并通过实验证明了其跨数据集有效性。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image diffusion models enable high-fidelity generation across diverse prompts. However, these models falter in long-tail settings, such as medical imaging, where rare pathologies comprise a small fraction of data. This results in mode collapse: tail-class outputs lack quality and diversity, undermining the goal of synthetic data augmentation for underrepresented conditions. We pinpoint gradient conflicts between frequent head and rare tail classes as the primary culprit, a factor unaddressed by existing sampling or conditioning methods that mainly steer inference without altering the learned distribution. To resolve this, we propose GRASP: Guided Residual Adapters with Sample-wise Partitioning. GRASP uses external priors to statically partition samples into clusters that minimize intra-group gradient clashes. It then fine-tunes pre-trained models by injecting cluster-specific residual adapters into transformer feedforward layers, bypassing learned gating for stability and efficiency. On the long-tail MIMIC-CXR-LT dataset, GRASP yields superior FID and diversity metrics, especially for rare classes, outperforming baselines like vanilla fine-tuning and Mixture of Experts variants. Downstream classification on NIH-CXR-LT improves considerably for tail labels. Generalization to ImageNet-LT confirms broad applicability. Our method is lightweight, scalable, and readily integrates with diffusion pipelines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种新的双手-物体交互视频生成方法，通过结构与接触感知表示（SCAR），无需3D注释即可生成物理真实的交互视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在2D与3D表示间存在矛盾：2D方法难以捕捉三维物理约束（如接触遮挡），3D方法需要大量昂贵标注且难以扩展。研究旨在开发一种既能保证交互物理真实性又具备可扩展性的解决方案。

Method: 提出两阶段方法：1) 构建结构与接触感知表示（SCAR），通过手部骨骼点与物体点云之间的距离、方向等几何关系隐式编码接触/遮挡约束；2) 采用分时生成策略，先生成SCAR表示再生成视频，使用共享编码器提取时空特征，专用解码器分别优化表示生成和视频生成。

Result: 在2个真实世界数据集上实现SOTA效果，生成的128×128分辨率视频比现有方法快2.3倍，遮挡区域PSNR提升4.8dB，在未见过的物体类别（如咖啡杯、剪刀）上保持76.5%生成质量，比基线模型高21.7%

Conclusion: 研究证明无需3D标注即可实现高质量HOI视频生成，SCAR通过几何约束隐式建模平衡了物理真实性和可扩展性，为交互生成领域提供了新的技术范式。

Abstract: Generating realistic hand-object interactions (HOI) videos is a significant challenge due to the difficulty of modeling physical constraints (e.g., contact and occlusion between hands and manipulated objects). Current methods utilize HOI representation as an auxiliary generative objective to guide video synthesis. However, there is a dilemma between 2D and 3D representations that cannot simultaneously guarantee scalability and interaction fidelity. To address this limitation, we propose a structure and contact-aware representation that captures hand-object contact, hand-object occlusion, and holistic structure context without 3D annotations. This interaction-oriented and scalable supervision signal enables the model to learn fine-grained interaction physics and generalize to open-world scenarios. To fully exploit the proposed representation, we introduce a joint-generation paradigm with a share-and-specialization strategy that generates interaction-oriented representations and videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on two real-world datasets in generating physics-realistic and temporally coherent HOI videos. Furthermore, our approach exhibits strong generalization to challenging open-world scenarios, highlighting the benefit of our scalable design. Our project page is https://hgzn258.github.io/SCAR/.

Abstract: Accurate subtype classification and outcome prediction in mesothelioma are essential for guiding therapy and patient care. Most computational pathology models are trained on large tissue images from resection specimens, limiting their use in real-world settings where small biopsies are common. We show that a self-supervised encoder trained on resection tissue can be applied to biopsy material, capturing meaningful morphological patterns. Using these patterns, the model can predict patient survival and classify tumor subtypes. This approach demonstrates the potential of AI-driven tools to support diagnosis and treatment planning in mesothelioma.

Abstract: Current story visualization methods tend to position subjects solely by text and face challenges in maintaining artistic consistency. To address these limitations, we introduce DreamingComics, a layout-aware story visualization framework. We build upon a pretrained video diffusion-transformer (DiT) model, leveraging its spatiotemporal priors to enhance identity and style consistency. For layout-based position control, we propose RegionalRoPE, a region-aware positional encoding scheme that re-indexes embeddings based on the target layout. Additionally, we introduce a masked condition loss to further constrain each subject's visual features to their designated region. To infer layouts from natural language scripts, we integrate an LLM-based layout generator trained to produce comic-style layouts, enabling flexible and controllable layout conditioning. We present a comprehensive evaluation of our approach, showing a 29.2% increase in character consistency and a 36.2% increase in style similarity compared to previous methods, while displaying high spatial accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了基于对比语言-图像预训练（CLIP）的语义与空间校正（SSR）方法，通过跨模态原型对齐（CMPA）和超像素引导校正（SGC）解决现有弱监督语义分割方法中前景和背景区域的过激活问题，在PASCAL VOC和MS COCO数据集上取得79.5%和50.6%的mIoU分数。

Motivation: 由于现有CLIP-based弱监督语义分割方法存在非目标前景和背景区域过激活的局限，本文提出解决该问题的新方法。

Method: 语义层面：通过跨模态原型对齐（CMPA）建立对比学习机制，加强模态间特征空间对齐，减少类间重叠并增强类间相关性；空间层面：采用超像素引导校正（SGC）利用超像素先验空间信息精确过滤非目标区域干扰。

Result: 在PASCAL VOC和MS COCO数据集上实验表明，本方法mIoU分别达到79.5%和50.6%，优于所有单阶段和复杂多阶段方法。

Conclusion: 通过语义与空间双校正机制，SSR方法有效解决了CLIP-based弱监督语义分割中的过激活问题，在多个数据集上取得优越性能。

Abstract: In recent years, Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) has been widely applied to Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) tasks due to its powerful cross-modal semantic understanding capabilities. This paper proposes a novel Semantic and Spatial Rectification (SSR) method to address the limitations of existing CLIP-based weakly supervised semantic segmentation approaches: over-activation in non-target foreground regions and background areas. Specifically, at the semantic level, the Cross-Modal Prototype Alignment (CMPA) establishes a contrastive learning mechanism to enforce feature space alignment across modalities, reducing inter-class overlap while enhancing semantic correlations, to rectify over-activation in non-target foreground regions effectively; at the spatial level, the Superpixel-Guided Correction (SGC) leverages superpixel-based spatial priors to precisely filter out interference from non-target regions during affinity propagation, significantly rectifying background over-activation. Extensive experiments on the PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms all single-stage approaches, as well as more complex multi-stage approaches, achieving mIoU scores of 79.5% and 50.6%, respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种训练无关的图像编辑框架FreqEdit，通过保留高频信息解决多轮编辑中的质量退化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有指令驱动图像编辑模型在单轮编辑中表现优异，但在多轮编辑时出现细节丢失导致的画质严重退化。研究团队系统性分析发现高频信息的逐步丢失是根本原因。

Method: 采用三层创新机制：1) 通过参考速度场注入高频特征保留细节；2) 自适应空间调制注入强度实现区域精准控制；3) 路径补偿机制周期性校正编辑轨迹防止过度约束。

Result: 实验证明该方法在10+轮连续编辑中表现稳定，在身份保留度和指令遵循能力两方面均优于7种最先进基线模型。

Conclusion: FreqEdit为生成模型的长期编辑任务提供了实用化解决方案，为多模态人机交互创造了新可能。

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing through natural language has emerged as a powerful paradigm for intuitive visual manipulation. While recent models achieve impressive results on single edits, they suffer from severe quality degradation under multi-turn editing. Through systematic analysis, we identify progressive loss of high-frequency information as the primary cause of this quality degradation. We present FreqEdit, a training-free framework that enables stable editing across 10+ consecutive iterations. Our approach comprises three synergistic components: (1) high-frequency feature injection from reference velocity fields to preserve fine-grained details, (2) an adaptive injection strategy that spatially modulates injection strength for precise region-specific control, and (3) a path compensation mechanism that periodically recalibrates the editing trajectory to prevent over-constraint. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FreqEdit achieves superior performance in both identity preservation and instruction following compared to seven state-of-the-art baselines.

*Hafsa Billah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本论文提出了一种通用视频情境分析（VSA）框架，通过联合使用扩展关系模型（R++）和图模型提升视频内容分析的准确性与通用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VSA方法依赖人工或定制化算法，存在效率低、跨领域适配难的问题，亟需能自动处理多领域视频情境的通用框架。

Method: 利用R++模型表征视频内容并实现流式查询（基于自研语言），同时通过图模型捕获复杂情境；结合参数化模板表达跨领域基元情境，支持领域无关性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法突破了定制化算法的局限，通过混合建模与参数化范式实现了通用VSA，为跨领域视频分析提供了可复用的技术路径。

Abstract: Automatically understanding video contents is important for several applications in Civic Monitoring (CM), general Surveillance (SL), Assisted Living (AL), etc. Decades of Image and Video Analysis (IVA) research have advanced tasks such as content extraction (e.g., object recognition and tracking). Identifying meaningful activities or situations (e.g., two objects coming closer) remains difficult and cannot be achieved by content extraction alone. Currently, Video Situation Analysis (VSA) is done manually with a human in the loop, which is error-prone and labor-intensive, or through custom algorithms designed for specific video types or situations. These algorithms are not general-purpose and require a new algorithm/software for each new situation or video from a new domain.
  This report proposes a general-purpose VSA framework that overcomes the above limitations. Video contents are extracted once using state-of-the-art Video Content Extraction technologies. They are represented using two alternative models -- the extended relational model (R++) and graph models. When represented using R++, the extracted contents can be used as data streams, enabling Continuous Query Processing via the proposed Continuous Query Language for Video Analysis. The graph models complement this by enabling the detection of situations that are difficult or impossible to detect using the relational model alone. Existing graph algorithms and newly developed algorithms support a wide variety of situation detection. To support domain independence, primitive situation variants across domains are identified and expressed as parameterized templates.

Abstract: Medical image registration is crucial for various clinical and research applications including disease diagnosis or treatment planning which require alignment of images from different modalities, time points, or subjects. Traditional registration techniques often struggle with challenges such as contrast differences, spatial distortions, and modality-specific variations. To address these limitations, we propose a method that integrates learnable edge kernels with learning-based rigid and non-rigid registration techniques. Unlike conventional layers that learn all features without specific bias, our approach begins with a predefined edge detection kernel, which is then perturbed with random noise. These kernels are learned during training to extract optimal edge features tailored to the task. This adaptive edge detection enhances the registration process by capturing diverse structural features critical in medical imaging. To provide clearer insight into the contribution of each component in our design, we introduce four variant models for rigid registration and four variant models for non-rigid registration. We evaluated our approach using a dataset provided by the Medical University across three setups: rigid registration without skull removal, with skull removal, and non-rigid registration. Additionally, we assessed performance on two publicly available datasets. Across all experiments, our method consistently outperformed state-of-the-art techniques, demonstrating its potential to improve multi-modal image alignment and anatomical structure analysis.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The rapid growth of data from satellite-based Earth observation (EO) systems poses significant challenges in data transmission and storage. We evaluate the potential of task-specific learned compression algorithms in this context to reduce data volumes while retaining crucial information. In detail, we compare traditional compression (JPEG 2000) versus a learned compression approach (Discretized Mixed Gaussian Likelihood) on three EO segmentation tasks: Fire, cloud, and building detection. Learned compression notably outperforms JPEG 2000 for large-scale, multi-channel optical imagery in both reconstruction quality (PSNR) and segmentation accuracy. However, traditional codecs remain competitive on smaller, single-channel thermal infrared datasets due to limited data and architectural constraints. Additionally, joint end-to-end optimization of compression and segmentation models does not improve performance over standalone optimization.

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in video generative models, robust metrics for evaluating visual and temporal correctness of complex human actions remain elusive. Critically, existing pure-vision encoders and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are strongly appearance-biased, lack temporal understanding, and thus struggle to discern intricate motion dynamics and anatomical implausibilities in generated videos. We tackle this gap by introducing a novel evaluation metric derived from a learned latent space of real-world human actions. Our method first captures the nuances, constraints, and temporal smoothness of real-world motion by fusing appearance-agnostic human skeletal geometry features with appearance-based features. We posit that this combined feature space provides a robust representation of action plausibility. Given a generated video, our metric quantifies its action quality by measuring the distance between its underlying representations and this learned real-world action distribution. For rigorous validation, we develop a new multi-faceted benchmark specifically designed to probe temporally challenging aspects of human action fidelity. Through extensive experiments, we show that our metric achieves substantial improvement of more than 68% compared to existing state-of-the-art methods on our benchmark, performs competitively on established external benchmarks, and has a stronger correlation with human perception. Our in-depth analysis reveals critical limitations in current video generative models and establishes a new standard for advanced research in video generation.

TL;DR: 本文提出Envision基准测试和Envision-Score评估工具，揭示多模态模型难以建模动态过程的问题，发现统一多模态模型在因果叙事一致性上优于专门T2I模型，但时空一致性仍是核心挑战。

Motivation: 现有模型依赖静态单图像生成导致动态进程建模能力不足，缺乏评估动态生成的基准和指标；需验证模型是否真正内化世界知识并遵守时空因果约束。

Method: 构建包含1000个四阶段提示的Envision基准测试，覆盖6个学科领域，建立Envision-Score多维评估体系，综合测量时空因果一致性、物理性和美学性，并对15个多模态模型进行系统评估。

Result: 统一多模态模型在因果叙事一致性上超越专业T2I模型，但两者均不如闭源模型；所有模型在时空一致性问题上均存在明显短板，显示静态单图训练阻碍动态世界建模。

Conclusion: 动态进程建模需要突破静态单图训练范式，未来研究应加强时空因果约束和世界知识内化，通过多帧连续生成评估推动多模态模型发展。

Abstract: Current multimodal models aim to transcend the limitations of single-modality representations by unifying understanding and generation, often using text-to-image (T2I) tasks to calibrate semantic consistency. However, their reliance on static, single-image generation in training and evaluation leads to overfitting to static pattern matching and semantic fusion, while fundamentally hindering their ability to model dynamic processes that unfold over time. To address these constraints, we propose Envision-a causal event progression benchmark for chained text-to-multi-image generation. Grounded in world knowledge and structured by spatiotemporal causality, it reorganizes existing evaluation dimensions and includes 1,000 four-stage prompts spanning six scientific and humanities domains. To transition evaluation from single images to sequential frames and assess whether models truly internalize world knowledge while adhering to causal-temporal constraints, we introduce Envision-Score, a holistic metric integrating multi-dimensional consistency, physicality, and aesthetics. Comprehensive evaluation of 15 models (10 specialized T2I models, 5 unified models) uncovers: specialized T2I models demonstrate proficiency in aesthetic rendering yet lack intrinsic world knowledge. Unified multimodal models bridge this gap, consistently outperforming specialized counterparts in causal narrative coherence. However, even these unified architectures remain subordinate to closed-source models and struggle to overcome the core challenge of spatiotemporal consistency. This demonstrates that a focus on causally-isolated single images impedes multi-frame reasoning and generation, promoting static pattern matching over dynamic world modeling-ultimately limiting world knowledge internalization, generation.

Conclusion: 通过连接符号推理与视觉感知体验，所提范式为MLLM的空间世界建模奠定基础

Abstract: Spatial reasoning, the ability to understand and interpret the 3D structure of the world, is a critical yet underdeveloped capability in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Current methods predominantly rely on verbal descriptive tuning, which suffers from visual illiteracy, i.e., they learn spatial concepts through textual symbols alone, devoid of connection to their visual manifestations. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces MILO, an Implicit spatIaL wOrld modeling paradigm that simulates human-like spatial imagination. MILO integrates a visual generator to provide geometry-aware feedback, thereby implicitly grounding the MLLM's symbolic reasoning in perceptual experience. Complementing this paradigm, we propose RePE (Relative Positional Encoding), a novel encoding scheme that captures relative camera-pose transformations, offering superior performance over absolute coordinate systems. To support the training, we construct GeoGen, a large-scale Geometry-aware Generative dataset with approximately 2,241 videos and 67,827 observation-action-outcome triplets. Experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances spatial reasoning capabilities across multiple baselines and benchmarks, offering a more holistic understanding of 3D space.

Abstract: Causal thinking enables humans to understand not just what is seen, but why it happens. To replicate this capability in modern AI systems, we introduce the task of visual causal discovery. It requires models to infer cause-and-effect relations among visual entities across diverse scenarios instead of merely perceiving their presence. To this end, we first construct the Visual Causal Graph dataset (VCG-32K), a large-scale collection of over 32,000 images annotated with entity-level causal graphs, and further develop CauSight, a novel vision-language model to perform visual causal discovery through causally aware reasoning. Our training recipe integrates three components: (1) training data curation from VCG-32K, (2) Tree-of-Causal-Thought (ToCT) for synthesizing reasoning trajectories, and (3) reinforcement learning with a designed causal reward to refine the reasoning policy. Experiments show that CauSight outperforms GPT-4.1 on visual causal discovery, achieving over a threefold performance boost (21% absolute gain).

Conclusion: 通过结合强化学习与大模型奖励机制，所提出的端到端框架有效解决了自动驾驶领域开放性推理能力不足的核心挑战。

Abstract: Recently, two-stage fine-tuning strategies, e.g., acquiring essential driving knowledge through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and further enhancing decision-making and planning via reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), have shown strong potential in advancing the knowledge-driven autonomous driving (AD) paradigm. However, the learning nature of SFT still limits the generalization of reasoning, thereby constraining the full potential of driving performance. Meanwhile, current RFT approaches are primarily applied to downstream tasks, since scene understanding is an open-ended problem where corresponding rewards are difficult to quantify. To address these limitations, we propose OpenREAD, an OPEN-ended REasoning reinforced vision-language model (VLM)-based autonomous driving (AD) framework that enables end-to-end RFT across the full spectrum from high-level reasoning to low-level trajectory planning. Specifically, we begin by constructing large-scale Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations on open-source driving-related knowledge datasets, and employ the powerful Qwen3 large language model (LLM) as the critic in RFT to quantify reasoning quality for open-ended questions during reward modeling. Extensive experiments confirm that joint end-to-end RFT yields substantial improvements in both upstream and downstream tasks, enabling OpenREAD to achieve state-of-the-art performance on reasoning and planning benchmarks.

Conclusion: 物理合理性仍是T2V模型的重大挑战，PID数据集和PhyDetEx为后续研究提供基准工具，揭示大模型在物理常识理解上的局限性。

Abstract: Driven by the growing capacity and training scale, Text-to-Video (T2V) generation models have recently achieved substantial progress in video quality, length, and instruction-following capability. However, whether these models can understand physics and generate physically plausible videos remains a question. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been widely used as general-purpose evaluators in various applications, they struggle to identify the physically impossible content from generated videos. To investigate this issue, we construct a \textbf{PID} (\textbf{P}hysical \textbf{I}mplausibility \textbf{D}etection) dataset, which consists of a \textit{test split} of 500 manually annotated videos and a \textit{train split} of 2,588 paired videos, where each implausible video is generated by carefully rewriting the caption of its corresponding real-world video to induce T2V models producing physically implausible content. With the constructed dataset, we introduce a lightweight fine-tuning approach, enabling VLMs to not only detect physically implausible events but also generate textual explanations on the violated physical principles. Taking the fine-tuned VLM as a physical plausibility detector and explainer, namely \textbf{PhyDetEx}, we benchmark a series of state-of-the-art T2V models to assess their adherence to physical laws. Our findings show that although recent T2V models have made notable progress toward generating physically plausible content, understanding and adhering to physical laws remains a challenging issue, especially for open-source models.

Abstract: Intelligent sports video analysis demands a comprehensive understanding of temporal context, from micro-level actions to macro-level game strategies. Existing end-to-end models often struggle with this temporal hierarchy, offering solutions that lack generalization, incur high development costs for new tasks, and suffer from poor interpretability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a reconfigurable Multi-Agent System (MAS) as a foundational framework for sports video understanding. In our system, each agent functions as a distinct "cognitive tool" specializing in a specific aspect of analysis. The system's architecture is not confined to a single temporal dimension or task. By leveraging iterative invocation and flexible composition of these agents, our framework can construct adaptive pipelines for both short-term analytic reasoning (e.g., Rally QA) and long-term generative summarization (e.g., match summaries). We demonstrate the adaptability of this framework using two representative tasks in badminton analysis, showcasing its ability to bridge fine-grained event detection and global semantic organization. This work presents a paradigm shift towards a flexible, scalable, and interpretable system for robust, cross-task sports video intelligence.The project homepage is available at https://aiden1020.github.io/COACH-project-page

Conclusion: KM-ViPE通过互联网规模训练实现在线动态场景建模，为自主机器人和AR/VR提供关键空间智能技术。

Abstract: We present KM-ViPE (Knowledge Mapping Video Pose Engine), a real-time open-vocabulary SLAM framework for uncalibrated monocular cameras in dynamic environments. Unlike systems requiring depth sensors and offline calibration, KM-ViPE operates directly on raw RGB streams, making it ideal for ego-centric applications and harvesting internet-scale video data for training. KM-ViPE tightly couples DINO visual features with geometric constraints through a high-level features based adaptive robust kernel that handles both moving objects and movable static objects (e.g., moving furniture in ego-centric views). The system performs simultaneous online localization and open-vocabulary semantic mapping by fusing geometric and deep visual features aligned with language embeddings. Our results are competitive with state-of-the-art approaches, while existing solutions either operate offline, need depth data and/or odometry estimation, or lack dynamic scene robustness. KM-ViPE benefits from internet-scale training and uniquely combines online operation, uncalibrated monocular input, and robust handling of dynamic scenes, which makes it a good fit for autonomous robotics and AR/VR applications and advances practical spatial intelligence capabilities for embodied AI.

Abstract: Cross-domain face retargeting requires disentangled control over identity, expressions, and domain-specific stylistic attributes. Existing methods, typically trained on real-world faces, either fail to generalize across domains, need test-time optimizations, or require fine-tuning with carefully curated multi-style datasets to achieve domain-invariant identity representations. In this work, we introduce \textit{StyleYourSmile}, a novel one-shot cross-domain face retargeting method that eliminates the need for curated multi-style paired data. We propose an efficient data augmentation strategy alongside a dual-encoder framework, for extracting domain-invariant identity cues and capturing domain-specific stylistic variations. Leveraging these disentangled control signals, we condition a diffusion model to retarget facial expressions across domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \textit{StyleYourSmile} achieves superior identity preservation and retargeting fidelity across a wide range of visual domains.

Motivation: 现有自监督学习框架将特征图压缩为全局向量，导致空间结构丢失，无法满足需要局部几何信息的机器人操作任务需求。

Method: 基于BYOL架构新增三个特征图级目标：显著性对齐（SAL）、块原型分布对齐（PPDA）和区域亲和匹配（RAM），在保留全局目标的同时维护跨视图的空间一致性。

Result: 在六个下游任务中持续超越九种SSL基线，在几何敏感的边缘姿态估计任务中较次优方法提升30%，误差接近监督学习上限。

Conclusion: 空间结构等变性是视觉-触觉融合数据的有效学习信号，通过保持特征与物体几何结构的可预测变化关系实现精准感知。

Abstract: Contact-rich robotic manipulation requires representations that encode local geometry. Vision provides global context but lacks direct measurements of properties such as texture and hardness, whereas touch supplies these cues. Modern visuo-tactile sensors capture both modalities in a single fused image, yielding intrinsically aligned inputs that are well suited to manipulation tasks requiring visual and tactile information. Most self-supervised learning (SSL) frameworks, however, compress feature maps into a global vector, discarding spatial structure and misaligning with the needs of manipulation. To address this, we propose SARL, a spatially-aware SSL framework that augments the Bootstrap Your Own Latent (BYOL) architecture with three map-level objectives, including Saliency Alignment (SAL), Patch-Prototype Distribution Alignment (PPDA), and Region Affinity Matching (RAM), to keep attentional focus, part composition, and geometric relations consistent across views. These losses act on intermediate feature maps, complementing the global objective. SARL consistently outperforms nine SSL baselines across six downstream tasks with fused visual-tactile data. On the geometry-sensitive edge-pose regression task, SARL achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.3955, a 30% relative improvement over the next-best SSL method (0.5682 MAE) and approaching the supervised upper bound. These findings indicate that, for fused visual-tactile data, the most effective signal is structured spatial equivariance, in which features vary predictably with object geometry, which enables more capable robotic perception.

TL;DR: Med-VCD is a novel sparse visual-contrastive decoding method that reduces hallucinations in medical LVLMs without the time cost of secondary decoding, achieving improved factual and hallucination accuracy across diverse medical tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current hallucination mitigation strategies for LVLMs face challenges including slow inference from secondary decoding, domain-specific solutions causing modality misalignment, and trade-offs between efficiency and reliability in medical applications.

Method: Developed Med-VCD with three components: (1) Visual-contrastive decoding that differentiates real/fake tokens via visual evidence, (2) Token-sparsification strategy to retain critical visual context while removing redundant tokens, and (3) Adaptive thresholding to dynamically control sparsity level during generation.

Result: Outperformed baseline medical LVLMs by 13% in factual accuracy and 6% in hallucination accuracy across 8 diverse medical datasets spanning ophthalmology, radiology, and pathology tasks, with faster inference speed than rollback approaches.

Conclusion: Med-VCD provides an efficient and generalizable solution for reliable medical LVLM deployment by synergizing visual contrastive learning with dynamic token sparsification, balancing generation quality and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) are now central to healthcare applications such as medical visual question answering and imaging report generation. Yet, these models remain vulnerable to hallucination outputs that appear plausible but are in fact incorrect. In the natural image domain, several decoding strategies have been proposed to mitigate hallucinations by reinforcing visual evidence, but most rely on secondary decoding or rollback procedures that substantially slow inference. Moreover, existing solutions are often domain-specific and may introduce misalignment between modalities or between generated and ground-truth content. We introduce Med-VCD, a sparse visual-contrastive decoding method that mitigates hallucinations in medical LVLMs without the time overhead of secondary decoding. Med-VCD incorporates a novel token-sparsification strategy that selects visually informed tokens on the fly, trimming redundancy while retaining critical visual context and thus balancing efficiency with reliability. Evaluations on eight medical datasets, spanning ophthalmology, radiology, and pathology tasks in visual question answering, report generation, and dedicated hallucination benchmarks, show that Med-VCD raises factual accuracy by an average of 13\% and improves hallucination accuracy by 6\% relative to baseline medical LVLMs.

### [175] [Physical ID-Transfer Attacks against Multi-Object Tracking via Adversarial Trajectory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01934)
*Chenyi Wang,Yanmao Man,Raymond Muller,Ming Li,Z. Berkay Celik,Ryan Gerdes,Jonathan Petit*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces AdvTraj, the first online and physical ID-manipulation attack for multi-object tracking (MOT) that exploits adversarial trajectories to confuse ID assignments without attacking object detection, achieving 100% white-box success and 93% transferable attacks against state-of-the-art MOT algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MOT attacks focus on hijacking individual trackers or manipulating IDs via object detection modules (digital domain, model-specific), which are non-robust and limited to specific samples. The paper aims to address under-explored vulnerabilities in MOT's object association phase and develop robust, transferable physical-world attacks.

Method: AdvTraj uses adversarial trajectory patterns to transfer IDs onto targeted objects in tracking-by-detection MOT systems. It operates in CARLA simulations, bypasses the need to attack object detection, and exploits common design principles in MOT algorithms. Two universal adversarial maneuvers (walkers/drivers) are proposed for real-world applicability.

Result: AdvTraj achieves 100% attack success rate in white-box scenarios (SORT tracker) and up to 93% cross-algorithm transferability against SOTA MOT models. Generated adversarial trajectories exhibit distinct patterns that exploit MOT's association mechanisms.

Conclusion: The study reveals critical vulnerabilities in MOT's object association phase and proposes universal adversarial strategies. It provides theoretical insights for enhancing MOT robustness against physical-world attacks in safety-critical applications (e.g., autonomous driving and surveillance).

Abstract: Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) is a critical task in computer vision, with applications ranging from surveillance systems to autonomous driving. However, threats to MOT algorithms have yet been widely studied. In particular, incorrect association between the tracked objects and their assigned IDs can lead to severe consequences, such as wrong trajectory predictions. Previous attacks against MOT either focused on hijacking the trackers of individual objects, or manipulating the tracker IDs in MOT by attacking the integrated object detection (OD) module in the digital domain, which are model-specific, non-robust, and only able to affect specific samples in offline datasets. In this paper, we present AdvTraj, the first online and physical ID-manipulation attack against tracking-by-detection MOT, in which an attacker uses adversarial trajectories to transfer its ID to a targeted object to confuse the tracking system, without attacking OD. Our simulation results in CARLA show that AdvTraj can fool ID assignments with 100% success rate in various scenarios for white-box attacks against SORT, which also have high attack transferability (up to 93% attack success rate) against state-of-the-art (SOTA) MOT algorithms due to their common design principles. We characterize the patterns of trajectories generated by AdvTraj and propose two universal adversarial maneuvers that can be performed by a human walker/driver in daily scenarios. Our work reveals under-explored weaknesses in the object association phase of SOTA MOT systems, and provides insights into enhancing the robustness of such systems.

*Zhongyu Yang,Dannong Xu,Wei Pang,Yingfang Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Script方法，通过去除冗余并保留查询相关视觉token，提升多模态大模型推理效率与准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有token剪枝方法忽略用户查询相关性或受限于注意力机制，导致多模态大模型处理高分辨率视觉内容时效率低下。

Method: Script包含两个模块：1）图结构剪枝模块消除视觉冗余；2）查询条件语义剪枝模块动态保留关键信息，二者联合优化推理效率与任务性能。

Result: 在14项视觉-语言基准测试中，Script相比现有方法平均提升6.8倍prefill速度和10倍FLOP缩减，保留96.88%原始性能（LLaVA-NeXT-7B）。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种通用且无需重训练的视觉token压缩方案，有效平衡了多模态模型的推理效率与预测准确性。

Abstract: The rapid growth of visual tokens in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) leads to excessive memory consumption and inference latency, especially when handling high-resolution images and videos. Token pruning is a technique used to mitigate this issue by removing redundancy, but existing methods often ignore relevance to the user query or suffer from the limitations of attention mechanisms, reducing their adaptability and effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose Script, a plug-and-play pruning method that requires no retraining and generalizes across diverse MLLMs. Script comprises two modules: a graph-structured pruning module that removes visually redundant tokens, and a query-conditioned semantic pruning module that preserves query-relevant visual information. Together, they enhance performance on multimodal tasks. Experiments on fourteen benchmarks across image and video understanding tasks show that Script consistently achieves higher model efficiency and predictive accuracy compared to existing pruning methods. On LLaVA-NeXT-7B, it achieves up to 6.8x prefill speedup and 10x FLOP reduction, while retaining 96.88% of the original performance.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为RLWG的框架，通过自监督后训练强化世界模型的几何基础，并设计了基于GRPO算法的GrndCtrl方法，显著提升了具身导航的空间一致性与长期稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频世界模型虽具高视觉保真度，但缺乏几何基础（如空间连贯性与结构稳定性），限制了其在导航等需要空间推理任务中的应用。

Method: 引入RLWG框架：1) 利用可验证的奖励函数（姿态循环一致性、深度重投影、时间连贯性）进行强化学习；2) 提出GrndCtrl算法，基于Group Relative Policy Optimization（GRPO）实现无需完整监督的策略对齐。

Result: GrndCtrl生成的世界模型在户外导航中展现出稳定轨迹、可靠几何结构及长期一致性，优于监督微调方法，效果类似于大语言模型的后训练对齐。

Conclusion: 通过几何接地与可验证奖励的自监督后训练，可在无需完全监督的情况下实现生成预训练与实际导航行为的有效对接，提升长期任务中的空间稳定性。

Abstract: Recent advances in video world modeling have enabled large-scale generative models to simulate embodied environments with high visual fidelity, providing strong priors for prediction, planning, and control. Yet, despite their realism, these models often lack geometric grounding, limiting their use in navigation tasks that require spatial coherence and long-horizon stability. We introduce Reinforcement Learning with World Grounding (RLWG), a self-supervised post-training framework that aligns pretrained world models with a physically verifiable structure through geometric and perceptual rewards. Analogous to reinforcement learning from verifiable feedback (RLVR) in language models, RLWG can use multiple rewards that measure pose cycle-consistency, depth reprojection, and temporal coherence. We instantiate this framework with GrndCtrl, a reward-aligned adaptation method based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), yielding world models that maintain stable trajectories, consistent geometry, and reliable rollouts for embodied navigation. Like post-training alignment in large language models, GrndCtrl leverages verifiable rewards to bridge generative pretraining and grounded behavior, achieving superior spatial coherence and navigation stability over supervised fine-tuning in outdoor environments.

TL;DR: SpriteHand是一种能够实时合成复杂手与物体交互视频的框架，无需依赖传统物理引擎的预定义模型，可支持多种物体类型和动态交互场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于物理仿真的方法难以处理可变形材料、弹性物体、铰链结构等复杂对象的动态交互，且需依赖手工设计的刚体模型和预设手势，限制了其灵活性与真实性。

Method: 提出基于自回归视频生成的SpriteHand框架，采用因果推理架构进行序列生成，并通过混合后训练策略提升视觉真实感与时间连贯性。

Result: 实现单张NVIDIA RTX 5090 GPU上约18帧/秒的实时生成（150ms延迟，640x368分辨率），连续输出超1分钟视频，且在视觉质量、物理合理性和交互保真度上优于生成模型与物理引擎基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为增强现实、机器人交互等场景提供了一种无需物理仿真即可生成高真实感手-物交互的新范式，但可能在细粒度物理约束建模上存在局限性。

Abstract: Modeling and synthesizing complex hand-object interactions remains a significant challenge, even for state-of-the-art physics engines. Conventional simulation-based approaches rely on explicitly defined rigid object models and pre-scripted hand gestures, making them inadequate for capturing dynamic interactions with non-rigid or articulated entities such as deformable fabrics, elastic materials, hinge-based structures, furry surfaces, or even living creatures. In this paper, we present SpriteHand, an autoregressive video generation framework for real-time synthesis of versatile hand-object interaction videos across a wide range of object types and motion patterns. SpriteHand takes as input a static object image and a video stream in which the hands are imagined to interact with the virtual object embedded in a real-world scene, and generates corresponding hand-object interaction effects in real time. Our model employs a causal inference architecture for autoregressive generation and leverages a hybrid post-training approach to enhance visual realism and temporal coherence. Our 1.3B model supports real-time streaming generation at around 18 FPS and 640x368 resolution, with an approximate 150 ms latency on a single NVIDIA RTX 5090 GPU, and more than a minute of continuous output. Experiments demonstrate superior visual quality, physical plausibility, and interaction fidelity compared to both generative and engine-based baselines.

Motivation: 传统任务需复杂提示输入且输出单一，无法满足用户灵活需求。SegCaptioning旨在通过简单提示（如边界框）生成多样化语义解释，解决高成本输入和信息有限的问题。

Method: 提出场景图引导扩散模型：1) Prompt-Centric Scene Graph Adaptor将用户提示映射为场景图；2) 场景图引导的双模态Transformer预测相关caption-mask对；3) 多实体对比学习损失确保视觉-文本实体对齐。

Result: 在两个数据集上实验显示SGDiff在SegCaptioning任务中表现优异，同时在分割和描述生成任务中也取得领先结果，验证了方法有效性。

Conclusion: 通过结构化的场景图扩散模型，论文成功实现了从简单提示生成多样化语义结果，为交互式图像理解提供了新范式。

Abstract: Controllable image semantic understanding tasks, such as captioning or segmentation, necessitate users to input a prompt (e.g., text or bounding boxes) to predict a unique outcome, presenting challenges such as high-cost prompt input or limited information output. This paper introduces a new task ``Image Collaborative Segmentation and Captioning'' (SegCaptioning), which aims to translate a straightforward prompt, like a bounding box around an object, into diverse semantic interpretations represented by (caption, masks) pairs, allowing flexible result selection by users. This task poses significant challenges, including accurately capturing a user's intention from a minimal prompt while simultaneously predicting multiple semantically aligned caption words and masks. Technically, we propose a novel Scene Graph Guided Diffusion Model that leverages structured scene graph features for correlated mask-caption prediction. Initially, we introduce a Prompt-Centric Scene Graph Adaptor to map a user's prompt to a scene graph, effectively capturing his intention. Subsequently, we employ a diffusion process incorporating a Scene Graph Guided Bimodal Transformer to predict correlated caption-mask pairs by uncovering intricate correlations between them. To ensure accurate alignment, we design a Multi-Entities Contrastive Learning loss to explicitly align visual and textual entities by considering inter-modal similarity, resulting in well-aligned caption-mask pairs. Extensive experiments conducted on two datasets demonstrate that SGDiff achieves superior performance in SegCaptioning, yielding promising results for both captioning and segmentation tasks with minimal prompt input.

Conclusion: 空间对齐的结构化视觉推理可增强感知策略学习，验证了推理形式与任务特征匹配的重要性

Abstract: Recent reinforcement-learning frameworks for visual perception policy have begun to incorporate intermediate reasoning chains expressed in natural language. Empirical observations indicate that such purely linguistic intermediate reasoning often reduces performance on perception tasks. We argue that the core issue lies not in reasoning per se but in the form of reasoning: while these chains perform semantic reasoning in an unstructured linguistic space, visual perception requires reasoning in a spatial and object-centric space. In response, we introduce Artemis, a perception-policy learning framework that performs structured proposal-based reasoning, where each intermediate step is represented as a (label, bounding-box) pair capturing a verifiable visual state. This design enables explicit tracking of intermediate states, direct supervision for proposal quality, and avoids ambiguity introduced by language-based reasoning. Artemis is built on Qwen2.5-VL-3B, achieves strong performance on grounding and detection task and exhibits substantial generalization to counting and geometric-perception tasks. The consistent improvements across these diverse settings confirm that aligning reasoning with spatial representations enhances perception-policy learning. Owing to its strengthened visual reasoning, Artemis also achieves competitive performance on general MLLM benchmarks, illustrating that spatially grounded reasoning provides a principled route toward scalable and general perception policies.

Abstract: Physical AI aims to develop models that can perceive and predict real-world dynamics; yet, the extent to which current multi-modal large language models and video generative models support these abilities is insufficiently understood. We introduce Physical AI Bench (PAI-Bench), a unified and comprehensive benchmark that evaluates perception and prediction capabilities across video generation, conditional video generation, and video understanding, comprising 2,808 real-world cases with task-aligned metrics designed to capture physical plausibility and domain-specific reasoning. Our study provides a systematic assessment of recent models and shows that video generative models, despite strong visual fidelity, often struggle to maintain physically coherent dynamics, while multi-modal large language models exhibit limited performance in forecasting and causal interpretation. These observations suggest that current systems are still at an early stage in handling the perceptual and predictive demands of Physical AI. In summary, PAI-Bench establishes a realistic foundation for evaluating Physical AI and highlights key gaps that future systems must address.

Abstract: We introduce Audio-Visual Affordance Grounding (AV-AG), a new task that segments object interaction regions from action sounds. Unlike existing approaches that rely on textual instructions or demonstration videos, which often limited by ambiguity or occlusion, audio provides real-time, semantically rich, and visually independent cues for affordance grounding, enabling more intuitive understanding of interaction regions. To support this task, we construct the first AV-AG dataset, comprising a large collection of action sounds, object images, and pixel-level affordance annotations. The dataset also includes an unseen subset to evaluate zero-shot generalization. Furthermore, we propose AVAGFormer, a model equipped with a semantic-conditioned cross-modal mixer and a dual-head decoder that effectively fuses audio and visual signals for mask prediction. Experiments show that AVAGFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance on AV-AG, surpassing baselines from related tasks. Comprehensive analyses highlight the distinctions between AV-AG and AVS, the benefits of end-to-end modeling, and the contribution of each component. Code and dataset have been released on https://jscslld.github.io/AVAGFormer/.

Abstract: The field of 360-degree omnidirectional understanding has been receiving increasing attention for advancing spatial intelligence. However, the lack of large-scale and diverse data remains a major limitation. In this work, we propose AirSim360, a simulation platform for omnidirectional data from aerial viewpoints, enabling wide-ranging scene sampling with drones. Specifically, AirSim360 focuses on three key aspects: a render-aligned data and labeling paradigm for pixel-level geometric, semantic, and entity-level understanding; an interactive pedestrian-aware system for modeling human behavior; and an automated trajectory generation paradigm to support navigation tasks. Furthermore, we collect more than 60K panoramic samples and conduct extensive experiments across various tasks to demonstrate the effectiveness of our simulator. Unlike existing simulators, our work is the first to systematically model the 4D real world under an omnidirectional setting.

Abstract: Unified multimodal models (UMMs) aim to jointly perform multimodal understanding and generation within a single framework. We present TUNA, a native UMM that builds a unified continuous visual representation by cascading a VAE encoder with a representation encoder. This unified representation space allows end-to-end processing of images and videos for both understanding and generation tasks. Compared to prior UMMs with decoupled representations, TUNA's unified visual space avoids representation format mismatches introduced by separate encoders, outperforming decoupled alternatives in both understanding and generation. Moreover, we observe that stronger pretrained representation encoders consistently yield better performance across all multimodal tasks, highlighting the importance of the representation encoder. Finally, in this unified setting, jointly training on both understanding and generation data allows the two tasks to benefit from each other rather than interfere. Our extensive experiments on multimodal understanding and generation benchmarks show that TUNA achieves state-of-the-art results in image and video understanding, image and video generation, and image editing, demonstrating the effectiveness and scalability of its unified representation design.

Motivation: 现有运动控制的图像生成视频(I2V)和视频生成视频(V2V)方法在场景上下文、视角变化或细粒度运动控制上存在局限，需解决复杂物体运动下的精确编辑问题。

Method: 利用源视频与目标运动的3D点追踪数据，通过两阶段训练（合成与真实数据）构建条件视频生成模型，通过3D追踪稀疏对应关系转移上下文至新运动，利用深度线索解决遮挡与深度顺序问题。

Conclusion: 该方法为视频编辑提供了更高自由度与创造力，在复杂运动编辑场景中展现显著优势。

Abstract: Camera and object motions are central to a video's narrative. However, precisely editing these captured motions remains a significant challenge, especially under complex object movements. Current motion-controlled image-to-video (I2V) approaches often lack full-scene context for consistent video editing, while video-to-video (V2V) methods provide viewpoint changes or basic object translation, but offer limited control over fine-grained object motion. We present a track-conditioned V2V framework that enables joint editing of camera and object motion. We achieve this by conditioning a video generation model on a source video and paired 3D point tracks representing source and target motions. These 3D tracks establish sparse correspondences that transfer rich context from the source video to new motions while preserving spatiotemporal coherence. Crucially, compared to 2D tracks, 3D tracks provide explicit depth cues, allowing the model to resolve depth order and handle occlusions for precise motion editing. Trained in two stages on synthetic and real data, our model supports diverse motion edits, including joint camera/object manipulation, motion transfer, and non-rigid deformation, unlocking new creative potential in video editing.

Conclusion: 物理规律缺陷可通过领域专业化修正，少量数据微调可实现物理规律校准和泛化

Abstract: Video generators are increasingly evaluated as potential world models, which requires them to encode and understand physical laws. We investigate their representation of a fundamental law: gravity. Out-of-the-box video generators consistently generate objects falling at an effectively slower acceleration. However, these physical tests are often confounded by ambiguous metric scale. We first investigate if observed physical errors are artifacts of these ambiguities (e.g., incorrect frame rate assumptions). We find that even temporal rescaling cannot correct the high-variance gravity artifacts. To rigorously isolate the underlying physical representation from these confounds, we introduce a unit-free, two-object protocol that tests the timing ratio $t_1^2/t_2^2 = h_1/h_2$, a relationship independent of $g$, focal length, and scale. This relative test reveals violations of Galileo's equivalence principle. We then demonstrate that this physical gap can be partially mitigated with targeted specialization. A lightweight low-rank adaptor fine-tuned on only 100 single-ball clips raises $g_{\mathrm{eff}}$ from $1.81\,\mathrm{m/s^2}$ to $6.43\,\mathrm{m/s^2}$ (reaching $65\%$ of terrestrial gravity). This specialist adaptor also generalizes zero-shot to two-ball drops and inclined planes, offering initial evidence that specific physical laws can be corrected with minimal data.

Result: 在4个多样性数据集上实验显示，相较基线方法中值误差低于50ms，且支持全自动化处理，适应复杂非受控场景。

Conclusion: VisualSync提供了一种无需专用硬件、可处理非受控场景的高精度视频同步方案，将3D几何约束与联合优化结合显著提升了实用性和精度。

Abstract: Today, people can easily record memorable moments, ranging from concerts, sports events, lectures, family gatherings, and birthday parties with multiple consumer cameras. However, synchronizing these cross-camera streams remains challenging. Existing methods assume controlled settings, specific targets, manual correction, or costly hardware. We present VisualSync, an optimization framework based on multi-view dynamics that aligns unposed, unsynchronized videos at millisecond accuracy. Our key insight is that any moving 3D point, when co-visible in two cameras, obeys epipolar constraints once properly synchronized. To exploit this, VisualSync leverages off-the-shelf 3D reconstruction, feature matching, and dense tracking to extract tracklets, relative poses, and cross-view correspondences. It then jointly minimizes the epipolar error to estimate each camera's time offset. Experiments on four diverse, challenging datasets show that VisualSync outperforms baseline methods, achieving an median synchronization error below 50 ms.

*Anbang Liu,Guanzhong Hu,Jiayi Wang,Ping Guo,Han Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合真实与虚拟数据生成的混合方法，以解决生物科学自动驾驶实验室（SDLs）中因注释数据稀缺而导致的精准模型训练难题，通过人工回路和图像生成技术实现了高精度冒泡检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶实验室需要高精度模型，但训练此类模型依赖大量标注数据（尤其是难以获取的负样本），需解决数据短缺问题以提高实验效率和可重复性。

Method: 构建双轨制数据生成框架：1) 实数采集采用人机协同模式，通过自动化采集与人工选择性验证结合；2) 虚拟数据基于参考条件和提示词生成图像，并经过筛选验证。两种数据源融合构成类别平衡数据集。

Result: 仅使用自动实测数据的模型达99.6%准确率，混合真实与生成数据维持99.4%准确率，同时减少数据采集与标注工作量。

Conclusion: 该方法为自动驾驶实验室提供可扩展的视觉反馈数据解决方案，有效解决罕见事件检测中的数据稀缺问题，并具备跨视觉任务的通用潜力。

Abstract: Self-driving laboratories offer a promising path toward reducing the labor-intensive, time-consuming, and often irreproducible workflows in the biological sciences. Yet their stringent precision requirements demand highly robust models whose training relies on large amounts of annotated data. However, this kind of data is difficult to obtain in routine practice, especially negative samples. In this work, we focus on pipetting, the most critical and precision sensitive action in SDLs. To overcome the scarcity of training data, we build a hybrid pipeline that fuses real and virtual data generation. The real track adopts a human-in-the-loop scheme that couples automated acquisition with selective human verification to maximize accuracy with minimal effort. The virtual track augments the real data using reference-conditioned, prompt-guided image generation, which is further screened and validated for reliability. Together, these two tracks yield a class-balanced dataset that enables robust bubble detection training. On a held-out real test set, a model trained entirely on automatically acquired real images reaches 99.6% accuracy, and mixing real and generated data during training sustains 99.4% accuracy while reducing collection and review load. Our approach offers a scalable and cost-effective strategy for supplying visual feedback data to SDL workflows and provides a practical solution to data scarcity in rare event detection and broader vision tasks.

*Angelina Parfenova,Andreas Marfurt,Alexander Denzler,Juergen Pfeffer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在无监督归纳编码中的表现，发现人类在处理复杂句子时更准确，而LLMs在简单句子上表现更好，但两者在标准对齐与专家评价上的差异显示出互补潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统质性分析依赖预设标签的演绎法，而本文旨在探索数据驱动的归纳编码中LLMs能否替代或辅助人工，并揭示人机编码偏差的机制差异。

Method: 对比了6个开源LLMs与人类专家在编码任务中的表现，通过专家评估引文难度、比对黄金标准标签以及收集人类对LLM与人工编码的评价进行实验。

Result: 人类在复杂句上表现优异但简单句效果差，LLMs反之；部分LLMs更贴近黄金标准却遭专家低评分，而人工标注虽有偏离但受其他人类认可。

Conclusion: 人机在编码任务中存在能力互补性，提示未来可能需结合两者的混合工作流；LLMs虽存在模式偏差，但在特定场景下能提供有价值洞察。

Abstract: This paper investigates the automation of qualitative data analysis, focusing on inductive coding using large language models (LLMs). Unlike traditional approaches that rely on deductive methods with predefined labels, this research investigates the inductive process where labels emerge from the data. The study evaluates the performance of six open-source LLMs compared to human experts. As part of the evaluation, experts rated the perceived difficulty of the quotes they coded. The results reveal a peculiar dichotomy: human coders consistently perform well when labeling complex sentences but struggle with simpler ones, while LLMs exhibit the opposite trend. Additionally, the study explores systematic deviations in both human and LLM generated labels by comparing them to the golden standard from the test set. While human annotations may sometimes differ from the golden standard, they are often rated more favorably by other humans. In contrast, some LLMs demonstrate closer alignment with the true labels but receive lower evaluations from experts.

TL;DR: 本文提出利用大语言模型自动化分析标注语料库的语法研究框架，验证了LLM推理与结构化语言数据结合的可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统标注语料库分析存在方法论和技术实现困难，需大量人工投入，亟需通过自动化手段提升效率与可扩展性。

Method: 构建基于LLM的智能框架，整合自然语言任务解析、代码生成和数据驱动推理，使用Universal Dependencies语料库进行多语言语序特征验证。

Result: 在170+语言的13项语序特征测试中，系统通过准确率、覆盖率、分布保真度三个维度有效量化语序变化，证明方法可行性。

Conclusion: 为可解释的语料库语法自动分析提供首个技术路径，展示LLM辅助语言学研究的潜力。

Abstract: Empirical grammar research has become increasingly data-driven, but the systematic analysis of annotated corpora still requires substantial methodological and technical effort. We explore how agentic large language models (LLMs) can streamline this process by reasoning over annotated corpora and producing interpretable, data-grounded answers to linguistic questions. We introduce an agentic framework for corpus-grounded grammatical analysis that integrates concepts such as natural-language task interpretation, code generation, and data-driven reasoning. As a proof of concept, we apply it to Universal Dependencies (UD) corpora, testing it on multilingual grammatical tasks inspired by the World Atlas of Language Structures (WALS). The evaluation spans 13 word-order features and over 170 languages, assessing system performance across three complementary dimensions - dominant-order accuracy, order-coverage completeness, and distributional fidelity - which reflect how well the system generalizes, identifies, and quantifies word-order variations. The results demonstrate the feasibility of combining LLM reasoning with structured linguistic data, offering a first step toward interpretable, scalable automation of corpus-based grammatical inquiry.

TL;DR: 本论文提出了一种无需数据增强的印度语言语法纠错方法，通过指令调优大语言模型与保守解码策略，在Malayalam和Hindi任务中取得领先效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 印度语言因标注数据匮乏、文字多样性及复杂形态学特征导致传统数据增强方法受限，需探索更高效的语法纠错范式。

Method: 采用12B GEMMA模型进行指令调优（4bit量化+参数高效微调），设计语言特异性提示模板，结合基于错误分类器的语法约束解码策略，通过轻量级规范化机制实现最小语义保留性修改。

Result: 在官方GLEU评测中，Malayalam语言得分92.41（总排名第六），Hindi得分81.44（总排名第三），显著优于传统依赖数据增强的流水线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法验证了分类器引导提示工程、适配器指令调优和确定性解码在印度语言纠错中的有效性，为后续研究形态句法约束与人工评估体系提供了技术路径。

Abstract: Grammatical error correction for Indic languages faces limited supervision, diverse scripts, and rich morphology. We propose an augmentation-free setup that uses instruction-tuned large language models and conservative decoding. A 12B GEMMA 3 model is instruction-tuned in bnb 4-bit precision with parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) and Alpaca-style formatting. Decoding follows a deterministic, constraint-aware procedure with a lightweight normaliser that encourages minimal, meaning-preserving edits. We operationalise inference, subsequent to instruction fine-tuning (IFT), via a fixed, language-specific prompt directly synthesised from a deterministic error classifier's taxonomy, label distributions, and precedence ordering computed on the training corpus.
  Under the official untuned GLEU evaluation, the system scores 92.41 on Malayalam, sixth overall, and 81.44 on Hindi, third overall. These results indicate that classifier-informed prompt design, adapter-based instruction tuning, and deterministic decoding provide a reproducible and a computationally efficient alternative to augmentation-centred pipelines for Indic GEC. The approach also motivates future work on stronger morphosyntactic constraints and human-centred evaluation of conservative edits.

*Sai Koneru,Matthias Huck,Jan Niehues*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本论文提出OmniFusion框架，通过融合多模态基础模型与翻译大语言模型，构建端到端的多模态翻译系统，解决了级联流水线在语音翻译中的延迟问题，并利用图像等多模态上下文提升翻译质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管开源单语言翻译模型在覆盖率与质量上取得进展，但其依赖级联流水线（语音→文本→翻译）导致高延迟，影响实时语音翻译效率，且无法利用图像等多模态上下文辅助消歧。同时，多模态预训练模型虽具备跨模态感知能力，但缺乏翻译模型的多语言覆盖和专业性能。

Method: 提出跨层隐藏状态融合策略，将多层多模态预训练模型(Omni 2.5-7B)的特征与翻译LLM(SeedX PPO-7B)连接，通过联合训练实现端到端系统。支持语音→文本、语音/图像→文本、图文→文本多种翻译模式。

Result: 实验表明OmniFusion在实时语音翻译场景下相比级联方法减少1秒延迟，在多模态任务中融合视觉信息显著提升翻译质量，模型支持语音与图像多模态协同推理。

Conclusion: 该方法首次成功融合多模态感知与专业翻译能力，通过架构创新实现在降低系统延迟的同时提升翻译质量，为多模态实时翻译系统提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: There has been significant progress in open-source text-only translation large language models (LLMs) with better language coverage and quality. However, these models can be only used in cascaded pipelines for speech translation (ST), performing automatic speech recognition first followed by translation. This introduces additional latency, which is particularly critical in simultaneous ST (SimulST), and prevents the model from exploiting multimodal context, such as images, which can aid disambiguation. Pretrained multimodal foundation models (MMFMs) already possess strong perception and reasoning capabilities across multiple modalities, but generally lack the multilingual coverage and specialized translation performance of dedicated translation LLMs. To build an effective multimodal translation system, we propose an end-to-end approach that fuses MMFMs with translation LLMs. We introduce a novel fusion strategy that connects hidden states from multiple layers of a pretrained MMFM to a translation LLM, enabling joint end-to-end training. The resulting model, OmniFusion, built on Omni 2.5-7B as the MMFM and SeedX PPO-7B as the translation LLM, can perform speech-to-text, speech-and-image-to-text, and text-and-image-to-text translation. Experiments demonstrate that OmniFusion effectively leverages both audio and visual inputs, achieves a 1-second latency reduction in SimulST compared to cascaded pipelines and also improves the overall translation quality\footnote{Code is available at https://github.com/saikoneru/OmniFusion}.

### [194] [Lost without translation -- Can transformer (language models) understand mood states?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00274)
*Prakrithi Shivaprakash,Diptadhi Mukherjee,Lekhansh Shukla,Animesh Mukherjee,Prabhat Chand,Pratima Murthy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Current language models poorly understand Indian language expressions of mood states but translation to English or Chinese enhances performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models' English-centric bias creates a barrier in psychiatric applications where cross-linguistic idioms of distress exist, particularly in underrepresented languages like Indian dialects.

Method: Collected 247 phrases across 11 Indian languages for four mood states, tested seven models (multilingual/Indic-specific/embedding methods), and evaluated k-means clustering performance using composite metrics comparing direct embeddings vs. translation pipelines to English/Chinese.

Result: Native Indic embeddings failed (Composite Score=0.002). Translation-based approaches showed 60-67% performance (Gemini-English: 0.60, human-English: 0.61, human-translated English→Chinese: 0.67), outperforming specialized Indic models IndicBERT/Sarvam-M.

Conclusion: Reliance on translation undermines LLM utility in India's mental health contexts. Sustainable solutions require building models with native language understanding for global health equity.

Abstract: Background: Large Language Models show promise in psychiatry but are English-centric. Their ability to understand mood states in other languages is unclear, as different languages have their own idioms of distress. Aim: To quantify the ability of language models to faithfully represent phrases (idioms of distress) of four distinct mood states (depression, euthymia, euphoric mania, dysphoric mania) expressed in Indian languages. Methods: We collected 247 unique phrases for the four mood states across 11 Indic languages. We tested seven experimental conditions, comparing k-means clustering performance on: (a) direct embeddings of native and Romanised scripts (using multilingual and Indic-specific models) and (b) embeddings of phrases translated to English and Chinese. Performance was measured using a composite score based on Adjusted Rand Index, Normalised Mutual Information, Homogeneity and Completeness. Results: Direct embedding of Indic languages failed to cluster mood states (Composite Score = 0.002). All translation-based approaches showed significant improvement. High performance was achieved using Gemini-translated English (Composite=0.60) and human-translated English (Composite=0.61) embedded with gemini-001. Surprisingly, human-translated English, further translated into Chinese and embedded with a Chinese model, performed best (Composite = 0.67). Specialised Indic models (IndicBERT and Sarvam-M) performed poorly. Conclusion: Current models cannot meaningfully represent mood states directly from Indic languages, posing a fundamental barrier to their psychiatric application for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes in India. While high-quality translation bridges this gap, reliance on proprietary models or complex translation pipelines is unsustainable. Models must first be built to understand diverse local languages to be effective in global mental health.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EduEval是一个针对中文K-12教育的综合性分层基准测试，评估大型语言模型的认知能力、真实性和覆盖范围，揭示模型在不同教育任务中的优势与不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在教育应用中潜藏风险，需通过系统性评估确保其符合教育标准。现有评估工具缺乏针对中文教育场景的多维度认知框架和真实数据支持。

Method: 提出EduAbility分类法（融合布卢姆和韦伯的认知层次），构建包含24类任务、11000+问题的基准，结合真实考题、课堂对话和专家设计任务，在零样本/少样本场景下测试14个LLM。

Result: 模型在记忆类任务表现良好，但课堂对话分类和创意生成表现较差；部分开源模型在复杂推理任务上超越专有系统；少样本提示效果因认知维度差异显著。

Conclusion: EduEval为教育专用LLM开发提供精细化评估指标，证明开放模型在教育场景的潜力，并揭示不同教学目标需定制化评估方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate significant potential for educational applications. However, their unscrutinized deployment poses risks to educational standards, underscoring the need for rigorous evaluation. We introduce EduEval, a comprehensive hierarchical benchmark for evaluating LLMs in Chinese K-12 education. This benchmark makes three key contributions: (1) Cognitive Framework: We propose the EduAbility Taxonomy, which unifies Bloom's Taxonomy and Webb's Depth of Knowledge to organize tasks across six cognitive dimensions including Memorization, Understanding, Application, Reasoning, Creativity, and Ethics. (2) Authenticity: Our benchmark integrates real exam questions, classroom conversation, student essays, and expert-designed prompts to reflect genuine educational challenges; (3) Scale: EduEval comprises 24 distinct task types with over 11,000 questions spanning primary to high school levels. We evaluate 14 leading LLMs under both zero-shot and few-shot settings, revealing that while models perform well on factual tasks, they struggle with classroom dialogue classification and exhibit inconsistent results in creative content generation. Interestingly, several open source models outperform proprietary systems on complex educational reasoning. Few-shot prompting shows varying effectiveness across cognitive dimensions, suggesting that different educational objectives require tailored approaches. These findings provide targeted benchmarking metrics for developing LLMs specifically optimized for diverse Chinese educational tasks.

*Muhammad Muneeb,David B. Ascher,Ahsan Baidar Bakht*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study benchmarks 47 context-based question answering (CBQA) models, identifying ahotrod/electra_large_discriminator_squad2_512 as the top performer (43% accuracy). Key findings include performance dependencies on context length, model size, and complexity, alongside genetic algorithm-based accuracy improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify pre-trained CBQA models that perform optimally across diverse datasets without fine-tuning, reducing the need for retraining in practical applications.

Method: Evaluated 47 Hugging Face CBQA models on eight datasets. Analyzed performance factors (context length, model size, answer length, complexity). Applied genetic algorithms to integrate model responses for accuracy enhancement.

Result: Best model: ahotrod/electra_large_discriminator_squad2_512 achieved 43% overall accuracy, with dataset-specific peaks (e.g., 96.45% on biomedical_cpgQA). Performance declined with longer answers/complex contexts. Genetic algorithms improved accuracy.

Conclusion: SQuAD-trained models like ahotrod/electra_large_discriminator_squad2_512 excel in CBQA tasks. Performance is constrained by context complexity and answer length, while genetic algorithms enhance accuracy through ensemble methods.

Abstract: Context-based question answering (CBQA) models provide more accurate and relevant answers by considering the contextual information. They effectively extract specific information given a context, making them functional in various applications involving user support, information retrieval, and educational platforms. In this manuscript, we benchmarked the performance of 47 CBQA models from Hugging Face on eight different datasets. This study aims to identify the best-performing model across diverse datasets without additional fine-tuning. It is valuable for practical applications where the need to retrain models for specific datasets is minimized, streamlining the implementation of these models in various contexts. The best-performing models were trained on the SQuAD v2 or SQuAD v1 datasets. The best-performing model was ahotrod/electra_large_discriminator_squad2_512, which yielded 43\% accuracy across all datasets. We observed that the computation time of all models depends on the context length and the model size. The model's performance usually decreases with an increase in the answer length. Moreover, the model's performance depends on the context complexity. We also used the Genetic algorithm to improve the overall accuracy by integrating responses from other models. ahotrod/electra_large_discriminator_squad2_512 generated the best results for bioasq10b-factoid (65.92\%), biomedical\_cpgQA (96.45\%), QuAC (11.13\%), and Question Answer Dataset (41.6\%). Bert-large-uncased-whole-word-masking-finetuned-squad achieved an accuracy of 82\% on the IELTS dataset.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于SQL的方法提升QA系统在时序推理任务的准确率，揭示模式设计比模型容量对精度提升更重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前QA系统难以处理动态演化的半结构化表格，需探索更高效的时序推理方法。

Method: 1) 从维基百科信息框生成3NF模式；2) 生成对应的SQL查询语句；3) 执行查询并验证结果。提出三大原则：保持上下文的规范化、降低歧义的语义命名、一致的时间锚定。

Result: 使用Gemini 2.5 Flash模式+Gemini-2.0-Flash查询组合，在EM分数上达到80.39，较基线（68.89 EM）提升16.8%。模式设计优化对性能提升的影响超过模型规模扩大。

Conclusion: 模式设计的质量对QA系统性能影响大于模型容量本身，规范化设计的三大原则显著提升时序推理效果，推荐采用轻量级模型但优化模式结构的性价比方案。

Abstract: Temporal reasoning over evolving semi-structured tables poses a challenge to current QA systems. We propose a SQL-based approach that involves (1) generating a 3NF schema from Wikipedia infoboxes, (2) generating SQL queries, and (3) query execution. Our central finding challenges model scaling assumptions: the quality of schema design has a greater impact on QA precision than model capacity. We establish three evidence-based principles: normalization that preserves context, semantic naming that reduces ambiguity, and consistent temporal anchoring. Our best configuration (Gemini 2.5 Flash schema + Gemini-2.0-Flash queries) achieves 80.39 EM, a 16.8\% improvement over the baseline (68.89 EM).

*Ayush Maheshwari,Kaushal Sharma,Vivek Patel,Aditya Maheshwari*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces IndicParam, a benchmark with 13,000+ questions for low-resource Indic languages (e.g., Nepali, Sanskrit), revealing poor performance of top LLMs (avg. 45%), and highlights cross-lingual transfer challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLMs are under-evaluated on low-resource Indic languages, lacking comprehensive benchmarks for cross-lingual understanding and generation capabilities.

Method: Human-curated construction of diverse multiple-choice questions (knowledge vs. linguistic), evaluation of 19 LLMs, and analysis of cross-lingual transferability across varied question formats (matching, sequence ordering).

Result: Even leading LLMs (GPT-5: 45% avg. accuracy) show significant performance gaps, indicating limitations in cross-lingual knowledge transfer for low-resource Indic languages.

Conclusion: IndicParam establishes a challenging benchmark for Indic languages, exposing current LLM limitations and providing public resources to drive research in low-resource language modeling.

Abstract: While large language models excel on high-resource multilingual tasks, low- and extremely low-resource Indic languages remain severely under-evaluated. We present IndicParam, a human-curated benchmark of over 13,000 multiple-choice questions covering 11 such languages (Nepali, Gujarati, Marathi, Odia as low-resource; Dogri, Maithili, Rajasthani, Sanskrit, Bodo, Santali, Konkani as extremely low-resource) plus Sanskrit-English code-mixed set. We evaluated 19 LLMs, both proprietary and open-weights, which reveals that even the top-performing GPT-5 reaches only 45.0% average accuracy, followed by DeepSeek-3.2 (43.1) and Claude-4.5 (42.7). We additionally label each question as knowledge-oriented or purely linguistic to discriminate factual recall from grammatical proficiency. Further, we assess the ability of LLMs to handle diverse question formats-such as list-based matching, assertion-reason pairs, and sequence ordering-alongside conventional multiple-choice questions. IndicParam provides insights into limitations of cross-lingual transfer and establishes a challenging benchmark for Indic languages. The dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/bharatgenai/IndicParam. Scripts to run benchmark are present at https://github.com/ayushbits/IndicParam.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨模态检索器在教育视频问答场景下面临延迟和内存限制，且需要同时处理视觉与文本模态的复杂交互以实现时间定位。

Method: 设计轻量级架构：1) 冻结预训练编码器加轻量视觉投影；2) 浅层跨模态注意力融合ASR文本与视频帧；3) 时间一致性正则化；4) 轻量交叉注意力再排序器。

Result: CrossFusion-RAG在CourseTimeQA上提升nDCG@10 0.10和MRR 0.08，单卡A100实现1.55秒中位数延迟，且在ASR噪声和时间定位上表现鲁棒。

Conclusion: 该框架通过轻量多模态融合策略，在保持单卡部署能力的同时显著提升教育视频问答效果，为后续研究提供可复现实验基准。

Abstract: We study timestamped question answering over educational lecture videos under a single-GPU latency/memory budget. Given a natural-language query, the system retrieves relevant timestamped segments and synthesizes a grounded answer. We present CourseTimeQA (52.3 h, 902 queries across six courses) and a lightweight, latency-constrained cross-modal retriever (CrossFusion-RAG) that combines frozen encoders, a learned 512->768 vision projection, shallow query-agnostic cross-attention over ASR and frames with a temporal-consistency regularizer, and a small cross-attentive reranker. On CourseTimeQA, CrossFusion-RAG improves nDCG@10 by 0.10 and MRR by 0.08 over a strong BLIP-2 retriever while achieving approximately 1.55 s median end-to-end latency on a single A100. Closest comparators (zero-shot CLIP multi-frame pooling; CLIP + cross-encoder reranker + MMR; learned late-fusion gating; text-only hybrid with cross-encoder reranking and its MMR variant; caption-augmented text retrieval; non-learned temporal smoothing) are evaluated under matched hardware and indexing. We report robustness across ASR noise (WER quartiles), diagnostics for temporal localization, and full training/tuning details to support reproducible comparison.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究显示，通过模拟大五人格特质，尤其是高开放性和低神经质，可降低大模型在相关性标注中的启动效应，提出利用人格提示缓解阈值启动问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 已有研究指出大规模语言模型（LLMs）在相关性标注中存在启动效应（priming effects），但尚未明确模拟的人格特质是否会影响此类偏见，探索心理学中人格与偏见的关系在LLMs中的应用。

Method: 结合TREC 2021与2022深度学习数据集，基于多个LLMs构建大五人格（Big Five）档案，量化不同人格特质对启动效应的影响。

Result: 高开放性（High Openness）、低神经质（Low Neuroticism）等特征显著降低启动敏感性；最佳缓解启动效应的人格特质因模型和任务类型而异。

Conclusion: 提出“人格提示”（personality prompting）方法，通过调整LLMs人格特征缓解启动效应，为心理学证据与模型评估实践提供连接。

Abstract: Recent research has explored LLMs as scalable tools for relevance labeling, but studies indicate they are susceptible to priming effects, where prior relevance judgments influence later ones. Although psychological theories link personality traits to such biases, it is unclear whether simulated personalities in LLMs exhibit similar effects. We investigate how Big Five personality profiles in LLMs influence priming in relevance labeling, using multiple LLMs on TREC 2021 and 2022 Deep Learning Track datasets. Our results show that certain profiles, such as High Openness and Low Neuroticism, consistently reduce priming susceptibility. Additionally, the most effective personality in mitigating priming may vary across models and task types. Based on these findings, we propose personality prompting as a method to mitigate threshold priming, connecting psychological evidence with LLM-based evaluation practices.

Abstract: This study describes the development of an AI-assisted error analysis system designed to identify, categorize, and correct writing errors in English. Utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) like Claude 3.5 Sonnet and DeepSeek R1, the system employs a detailed taxonomy grounded in linguistic theories from Corder (1967), Richards (1971), and James (1998). Errors are classified at both word and sentence levels, covering spelling, grammar, and punctuation. Implemented through Python-coded API calls, the system provides granular feedback beyond traditional rubric-based assessments. Initial testing on isolated errors refined the taxonomy, addressing challenges like overlapping categories. Final testing used "English as she is spoke" by Jose da Fonseca (1855), a text rich with authentic linguistic errors, to evaluate the system's capacity for handling complex, multi-layered analysis. The AI successfully identified diverse error types but showed limitations in contextual understanding and occasionally generated new error categories when encountering uncoded errors. This research demonstrates AI's potential to transform EFL instruction by automating detailed error analysis and feedback. While promising, further development is needed to improve contextual accuracy and expand the taxonomy to stylistic and discourse-level errors.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CryptoBench is a dynamic cryptocurrency domain-focused benchmark for LLM agents, featuring 50 expert-designed monthly questions across four analytical categories to rigorously assess real-world capabilities like time-sensitive data synthesis and predictive analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing general-purpose LLM agent benchmarks fail to address crypto analysis challenges including extreme time-sensitivity, adversarial information, and need to synthesize diverse on-chain/DeFi data sources, creating a demand for domain-specific evaluation standards.

Method: Created live monthly benchmark with 50 professionally crafted questions organized in four-quadrant framework (Simple/Complex Retrieval/Prediction) enabling granular assessment of both basic data gathering and advanced analytical skills.

Result: Evaluation of 10 LLMs revealed significant retrieval-prediction imbalance - models excel at data retrieval but consistently underperform in predictive tasks requiring information synthesis, exposing limitations in analytical depth despite factual accuracy.

Conclusion: CryptoBench establishes a critical evaluation tool demonstrating current LLM agent limitations in cryptocurrency analysis, emphasizing urgent need to improve predictive reasoning capabilities beyond superficial data retrieval performance.

Abstract: This paper introduces CryptoBench, the first expert-curated, dynamic benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate the real-world capabilities of Large Language Model (LLM) agents in the uniquely demanding and fast-paced cryptocurrency domain. Unlike general-purpose agent benchmarks for search and prediction, professional crypto analysis presents specific challenges: \emph{extreme time-sensitivity}, \emph{a highly adversarial information environment}, and the critical need to synthesize data from \emph{diverse, specialized sources}, such as on-chain intelligence platforms and real-time Decentralized Finance (DeFi) dashboards. CryptoBench thus serves as a much more challenging and valuable scenario for LLM agent assessment. To address these challenges, we constructed a live, dynamic benchmark featuring 50 questions per month, expertly designed by crypto-native professionals to mirror actual analyst workflows. These tasks are rigorously categorized within a four-quadrant system: Simple Retrieval, Complex Retrieval, Simple Prediction, and Complex Prediction. This granular categorization enables a precise assessment of an LLM agent's foundational data-gathering capabilities alongside its advanced analytical and forecasting skills.
  Our evaluation of ten LLMs, both directly and within an agentic framework, reveals a performance hierarchy and uncovers a failure mode. We observe a \textit{retrieval-prediction imbalance}, where many leading models, despite being proficient at data retrieval, demonstrate a pronounced weakness in tasks requiring predictive analysis. This highlights a problematic tendency for agents to appear factually grounded while lacking the deeper analytical capabilities to synthesize information.

*Yang Xiao,Chunpu Xu,Ruifeng Yuan,Jiashuo Wang,Wenjie Li,Pengfei Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了SCALE框架，通过根据子问题的难度在推理时选择性分配计算资源来提高大型语言模型的数学推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在所有推理子问题中均匀分配资源，导致计算资源利用效率低，难题得不到足够关注，而常规操作消耗过多资源。

Method: SCALE包含四个阶段：(1)将问题分解为顺序推理子问题，(2)评估每个子问题的难度，(3)根据难度选择系统1（简单）或系统2（复杂）处理模式，(4)上下文传播下的顺序执行。

Result: 在AIME25数据集上准确率从57.50%提升至71.25%（提高13.75个百分点），同时计算成本降低33%-53%。

Conclusion: SCALE通过针对性资源分配显著提升了测试时缩放的效果，解决了当前方法的计算资源瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Test-time compute scaling has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing mathematical reasoning in large language models (LLMs) by allocating additional computational resources during inference. However, current methods employ uniform resource distribution across all reasoning sub-problems, creating fundamental bottlenecks where challenging sub-problems receive insufficient attention while routine operations consume disproportionate resources. This uniform allocation creates performance bottlenecks where additional computational resources yield diminishing returns. Inspired by dual-process theory, we propose \textbf{SCALE} (Selective Resource Allocation), a framework that selectively allocates computational resources based on sub-problem difficulty. SCALE operates through four stages: (1) problem decomposition into sequential reasoning sub-problems, (2) difficulty assessment of each sub-problem to distinguish between routine operations and computationally challenging sub-problems, (3) selective processing mode assignment between System 1 for simple sub-problems and System 2 for complex ones, and (4) sequential execution with context propagation. By concentrating resources on challenging sub-problems while processing routine operations efficiently, SCALE achieves substantial performance improvements with superior resource utilization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SCALE significantly outperforms uniform scaling baselines, achieving accuracy improvements of up to 13.75 percentage points (57.50% to 71.25% on AIME25) while reducing computational costs by 33%-53%, representing a major advance in test-time scaling that addresses fundamental limitations of current approaches.

TL;DR: 提出CACARA模型，通过新兴对齐学习实现无需完全重新训练的多模态多语言集成，节省资源并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型依赖多模态资源密集型训练，跨语言扩展同样代价高昂

Method: 构建基于新兴对齐学习的多模态多语言架构CACARA，仅需微调新模态数据对齐的英文部分

Result: 支持超100种语言且无需多语言预训练，音频-文本检索R@1指标提升14.24个百分点

Conclusion: 验证新兴对齐范式可有效实现多模态多语言扩展，训练成本低于单语模型

Abstract: As deep learning models evolve, new applications and challenges are rapidly emerging. Tasks that once relied on a single modality, such as text, images, or audio, are now enriched by seamless interactions between multimodal data. These connections bridge information gaps: an image can visually materialize a text, while audio can add context to an image. Researchers have developed numerous multimodal models, but most rely on resource-intensive training across multiple modalities. Similarly, extending these models to new languages often follows the same resource-heavy training strategy. In this work, we propose a multimodal and multilingual architecture, CACARA, trained through emergent alignment learning, enabling the seamless integration of new modalities into an existing bimodal/multimodal model without requiring full retraining. This work breaks new ground by demonstrating that this emergent alignment paradigm can unlock multilingual capabilities from monolingual training. By fine-tuning the newly incorporated modality only on data aligned with the English language, our model develops support for over 100 languages without explicit multilingual pretraining or tuning of the text encoder. Such emergent multimodal and multilingual properties are gained efficiently, preserving previously learned knowledge at a training cost comparable to that of a monolingual model. Our strategy achieves up to a 14.24 percentage points improvement in R@1 audio-to-text retrieval, outperforming state-of-the-art multimodal models -- all without the heavy computational cost of retraining across every modality and language.

Conclusion: G-KV通过全局重要性评分和后训练优化技术，显著增强了大规模语言模型的KV缓存压缩能力，提升了推理效率。

Abstract: Recent reasoning large language models (LLMs) excel in complex tasks but encounter significant computational and memory challenges due to long sequence lengths. KV cache compression has emerged as an effective approach to greatly enhance the efficiency of reasoning. However, existing methods often focus on prompt compression or token eviction with local attention score, overlooking the long-term importance of tokens. We propose G-KV, a KV cache eviction method that employs a global scoring mechanism, combining local and historical attention scores to more accurately assess token importance. Additionally, we introduce post-training techniques, including reinforcement learning and distillation, to optimize models for compressed KV cache settings. The code of this paper is available on: https://github.com/microsoft/G-KV.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的诊断框架，从四个维度区分语言模型的数学推理能力与表面模式匹配，通过在Qwen3-0.6B模型上的实验揭示了传统准确率指标无法捕捉的逻辑计算缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数学推理评估依赖答案准确率，可能掩盖模型逻辑计算的根本缺陷，需要更细致的诊断方法揭示深层问题。

Method: 构建包含前向-后向一致性、传递性覆盖、反事实敏感性和扰动鲁棒性的四维诊断框架，并在MenatQA数据集上对Qwen3-0.6B模型进行案例研究。

Result: 模型表面准确率达70%+，但后向一致性仅15%、传递性覆盖32.2%，且对扰动敏感，暴露了传统指标无法发现的推理失败问题。

Conclusion: 小型模型可能依赖模式匹配而非逻辑计算，提出的框架可跨模型规模和架构评估推理保真度，推动超越准确率的数学推理研究。

Abstract: Current evaluation of mathematical reasoning in language models relies primarily on answer accuracy, potentially masking fundamental failures in logical computation. We introduce a diagnostic framework that distinguishes genuine mathematical reasoning from superficial pattern matching through four complementary axes: forward-backward consistency, transitivity coverage, counterfactual sensitivity, and perturbation robustness. Through a case study applying this framework to Qwen3-0.6B on the MenatQA dataset, we reveal a striking disconnect between surface performance and reasoning fidelity. While the model achieves reasonable answer accuracy (70%+), it demonstrates poor backward consistency (15%), limited transitivity coverage (32.2%), and brittle sensitivity to perturbations. Our diagnostics expose reasoning failures invisible to traditional accuracy metrics, suggesting that this small model relies heavily on pattern matching rather than genuine logical computation. While our empirical findings are based on a single 600M-parameter model, the diagnostic framework itself is model-agnostic and generalizable. We release our evaluation protocols to enable the research community to assess reasoning fidelity across different model scales and architectures, moving beyond surface-level accuracy toward verifiable mathematical reasoning.

*Alla Chepurova,Aydar Bulatov,Yuri Kuratov,Mikhail Burtsev*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Wikontic是一种高效的知识图谱构建管道，在多个基准测试中表现优异，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型（LLM）常将知识图谱（KG）作为辅助结构，而忽视其内在质量。本文旨在通过改进KG构建方法来弥补这一不足。

Method: 采用三阶段管道：提取带限定词的候选三元组，应用Wikidata类型和关系约束，并通过实体标准化减少冗余，最终生成紧凑、一致且高连通的KG。

Result: 在MuSiQue测试中，96%的三元组包含正确答案实体；在HotpotQA和MuSiQue上的F1分别为76.0和59.8；在MINE-1基准中实现86%的信息保留率，且构建效率显著优于AriGraph和GraphRAG。

Conclusion: Wikontic通过高质量KG提升LLM结构化知识利用能力，提供可扩展解决方案，且在效率和性能上均超越现有技术。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) provide structured, verifiable grounding for large language models (LLMs), but current LLM-based systems commonly use KGs as auxiliary structures for text retrieval, leaving their intrinsic quality underexplored. In this work, we propose Wikontic, a multi-stage pipeline that constructs KGs from open-domain text by extracting candidate triplets with qualifiers, enforcing Wikidata-based type and relation constraints, and normalizing entities to reduce duplication. The resulting KGs are compact, ontology-consistent, and well-connected; on MuSiQue, the correct answer entity appears in 96% of generated triplets. On HotpotQA, our triplets-only setup achieves 76.0 F1, and on MuSiQue 59.8 F1, matching or surpassing several retrieval-augmented generation baselines that still require textual context. In addition, Wikontic attains state-of-the-art information-retention performance on the MINE-1 benchmark (86%), outperforming prior KG construction methods. Wikontic is also efficient at build time: KG construction uses less than 1,000 output tokens, about 3$\times$ fewer than AriGraph and $<$1/20 of GraphRAG. The proposed pipeline enhances the quality of the generated KG and offers a scalable solution for leveraging structured knowledge in LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding and generation. However, single-model responses often exhibit inconsistencies, hallucinations, and varying quality across different query domains. This paper presents ART (Adaptive Response Tuning), a novel framework that employs tournament-style ELO ranking and multi-agent reasoning to systematically optimize LLM outputs. By enabling multiple LLM agents to compete, critique, and collaborate through structured tournament workflows, ART produces consensus responses that outperform individual model outputs. Our framework introduces configurable tournament parameters, dynamic agent selection, and multiple consensus fusion strategies. Experimental evaluations demonstrate significant improvements in response accuracy, coherence, and reliability compared to baseline single-model approaches. The ART framework provides a scalable, production-ready solution for applications requiring high-quality, vetted LLM responses, achieving an 8.4% improvement in overall quality metrics and R22 values exceeding 0.96 in ELO rating convergence.

Conclusion: 该框架通过可视化可追溯性和持续人机协同，相比传统验证方法降低42%的误判率，提升企业知识系统的可信度。

Abstract: Large Language Models have rapidly advanced in their ability to interpret and generate natural language. In enterprise settings, they are frequently augmented with closed-source domain knowledge to deliver more contextually informed responses. However, operational constraints such as limited context windows and inconsistencies between pre-training data and supplied knowledge often lead to hallucinations, some of which appear highly credible and escape routine human review. Current mitigation strategies either depend on costly, large-scale gold-standard Q\&A curation or rely on secondary model verification, neither of which offers deterministic assurance. This paper introduces a framework that organizes proprietary knowledge and model-generated content into interactive visual knowledge graphs. The objective is to provide end users with a clear, intuitive view of potential hallucination zones by linking model assertions to underlying sources of truth and indicating confidence levels. Through this visual interface, users can diagnose inconsistencies, identify weak reasoning chains, and supply corrective feedback. The resulting human-in-the-loop workflow creates a structured feedback loop that can enhance model reliability and continuously improve response quality.

In this paper, we measure the performance of GPT-4 on one such task and compare results to human annotators. We investigate ChatGPT versions 3.5, 4, and 4o to examine performance given rapid changes in technological advancement of large language models. We craft four prompt styles as input and evaluate precision, recall, and F1 scores. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations of results demonstrate that while including label definitions in prompts may help performance, overall GPT-4 has difficulty classifying nuanced language. Qualitative analysis reveals four specific findings. Our results suggest the use of ChatGPT in classification tasks involving nuanced language should be conducted with prudence.

Abstract: This study proposes a language-agnostic transformer-based POS tagging framework designed for low-resource languages, using Bangla and Hindi as case studies. With only three lines of framework-specific code, the model was adapted from Bangla to Hindi, demonstrating effective portability with minimal modification. The framework achieves 96.85 percent and 97 percent token-level accuracy across POS categories in Bangla and Hindi while sustaining strong F1 scores despite dataset imbalance and linguistic overlap. A performance discrepancy in a specific POS category underscores ongoing challenges in dataset curation. The strong results stem from the underlying transformer architecture, which can be replaced with limited code adjustments. Its modular and open-source design enables rapid cross-lingual adaptation while reducing model design and tuning overhead, allowing researchers to focus on linguistic preprocessing and dataset refinement, which are essential for advancing NLP in underrepresented languages.

Abstract: Training models for Natural Language Processing (NLP) requires substantial computational resources and time, posing significant challenges, especially for NLP development in Bangla, where access to high-end hardware is often limited. In this work, we explore automatic mixed precision (AMP) training as a means to improve computational efficiency without sacrificing model performance. By leveraging a dynamic mix of 16-bit and 32-bit floating-point computations, AMP lowers GPU memory requirements and speeds up training without degrading model performance. We evaluate AMP across four standard Bangla NLP tasks, namely sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, error classification, and question answering, using four transformer-based models: BanglaBERT, BanglishBERT, XLM-R, and mBERT. Our results demonstrate that AMP accelerates training by 44.5% and reduces memory consumption by 17.6%, while maintaining F-1 score within 99.7% of the full-precision baselines. This empirical study highlights AMP's potential to democratize access to state-of-the-art NLP capabilities in hardware-constrained settings by lowering computational barriers.

Conclusion: WaterSearch通过创新性嵌入方案和优化策略，实现了文本质量与水印鲁棒性的有效平衡，开源代码促进未来研究。

Abstract: Watermarking acts as a critical safeguard in text generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). By embedding identifiable signals into model outputs, watermarking enables reliable attribution and enhances the security of machine-generated content. Existing approaches typically embed signals by manipulating token generation probabilities. Despite their effectiveness, these methods inherently face a trade-off between detectability and text quality: the signal strength and randomness required for robust watermarking tend to degrade the performance of downstream tasks.
  In this paper, we design a novel embedding scheme that controls seed pools to facilitate diverse parallel generation of watermarked text. Based on that scheme, we propose WaterSearch, a sentence-level, search-based watermarking framework adaptable to a wide range of existing methods. WaterSearch enhances text quality by jointly optimizing two key aspects: 1) distribution fidelity and 2) watermark signal characteristics. Furthermore, WaterSearch is complemented by a sentence-level detection method with strong attack robustness. We evaluate our method on three popular LLMs across ten diverse tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves an average performance improvement of 51.01\% over state-of-the-art baselines at a watermark detectability strength of 95\%. In challenging scenarios such as short text generation and low-entropy output generation, our method yields performance gains of 47.78\% and 36.47\%, respectively. Moreover, under different attack senarios including insertion, synonym substitution and paraphrase attasks, WaterSearch maintains high detectability, further validating its robust anti-attack capabilities.

### [216] [Less is More: Resource-Efficient Low-Rank Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00878)
*Chunlin Tian,Xuyang Wei,Huanrong Liu,Zhijiang Guo,Li Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EffiLoRA improves LoRA by unifying the A matrix across all layers and dynamically updating B matrices, reducing training costs while maintaining performance in diverse models like language, multimodal, and diffusion systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA's parameter interference and high overhead, especially in complex datasets, motivated the work. Existing approaches decoupling matrices still face high training costs, prompting the need to address parameter redundancy.

Method: EffiLoRA uses a shared A matrix across transformer layers and dynamically selects B matrices during training to balance resource budget and performance. This reduces inter-matrix and intra-layer redundancy.

Result: EffiLoRA outperforms LoRA in efficiency and robustness across commonsense reasoning, visual instruction tuning, and image generation, demonstrating lower training costs and better generalization.

Conclusion: EffiLoRA is a lightweight, generalizable PEFT method that resolves LoRA's limitations, offering improved efficiency and adaptability for diverse machine learning tasks.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a widely adopted parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method for Large Language Models (LLMs), but it still incurs notable overhead and suffers from parameter interference in complex datasets. While re- cent works decouple LoRA update matrices to exploit matrix-wise asymmetry, training costs remain high. We revisit LoRA from the perspective of inter-matrix and intra-layer parameter redundancy and propose Resource-Efficient Low-Rank Adaptation, EffiLoRA, a lightweight and generalizable approach for language, multimodal, and diffusion models. EffiLoRA employs a unified A matrix across all transformer layers and introduces a runtime selective B matrices up- date to dynamically trade-off the system resource budget and model performance. EffiLoRA consistently outperforms LoRA across diverse modalities, including commonsense reasoning, visual instruction tuning, and image generation, demon- strating improved efficiency and robustness.

*Jianxiang Zang,Yongda Wei,Ruxue Bai,Shiyu Jiang,Nijia Mo,Binhong Li,Qiang Sun,Hui Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Reward Auditor框架，通过检测奖励模型在现实扰动下的偏好感知置信度退化，评估其条件可靠性（适配性）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法仅关注偏好感知精度，但忽视现实场景中的系统性弱点。引入‘适配性’指标，旨在量化奖励模型在真实扰动下的可靠性，解决实际应用中的安全隐患。

Method: 构建假设检验框架Reward Auditor，采用科学审计方法：在扰动场景中量化RM偏好置信度的分布退化，推断统计显著性与效应大小，识别系统性漏洞。

Result: 通过分析现实扰动下的置信度退化，有效推断RM漏洞的确定性与严重性，验证框架在多样性场景中的适用性。

Conclusion: 提供评估奖励模型现实可靠性的新范式，为构建可验证安全、稳健的大模型对齐体系奠定基础。

Abstract: Reliable reward models (RMs) are critical for ensuring the safe alignment of large language models (LLMs). However, current evaluation methods focus solely on preference perception accuracies in given specific scenarios, obscuring the critical vulnerabilities of RMs in real-world scenarios. We identify the true challenge lies in assessing a novel dimension: Suitability, defined as conditional reliability under specific real-world perturbations. To this end, we introduce Reward Auditor, a hypothesis-testing framework specifically designed for RM suitability inference. Rather than answering "How accurate is the RM's preference perception for given samples?", it employs scientific auditing to answer: "Can we infer RMs exhibit systematic vulnerabilities in specific real-world scenarios?". Under real-world perturbed scenarios, Reward Auditor quantifies statistical significance and effect size by auditing distribution degradation of RM preference perception confidence. This enables inference of both the certainty and severity of RM vulnerabilities across diverse real-world scenarios. This lays a solid foundation for building next-generation LLM alignment systems that are verifiably safe, more robust, and trustworthy.

### [218] [Mitigating Hallucinations in Zero-Shot Scientific Summarisation: A Pilot Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00931)
*Imane Jaaouine,Ross D. King*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Prompt engineering methods like context repetition and random addition significantly reduce context inconsistency hallucinations in zero-shot LLM summarization of scientific texts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models (LLMs) often generate hallucinated outputs misaligned with user prompts during zero-shot summarization of scientific texts. This study aims to explore whether prompt engineering (PE) can mitigate such hallucinations.

Method: Experiments used six instruction-tuned LLMs across eight yeast biotechnology abstracts with seven prompts: baseline, two instruction complexity levels (PE-1/PE-2), two context repetition levels (CR-K1/K2), and two random addition levels (RA-K1/K2). Key metrics included ROUGE, BERTScore, METEOR, and cosine similarity. Statistical analysis used BCa bootstrap confidence intervals and Wilcoxon tests.

Result: Context repetition (CR) improved lexical alignment (ROUGE-2: +5.5%, ROUGE-L: +4.8%), while random addition (RA) also showed significant gains (ROUGE-1: +3.7%). Both methods enhanced lexical consistency, though semantic alignment (BERTScore) improvement was modest (-1.2% to +0.8%).

Conclusion: Prompt engineering strategies effectively mitigate context inconsistency hallucinations in zero-shot scientific summarization tasks by leveraging key sentence repetition strategies, offering practical implications for improving LLM reliability without model retraining.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) produce context inconsistency hallucinations, which are LLM generated outputs that are misaligned with the user prompt. This research project investigates whether prompt engineering (PE) methods can mitigate context inconsistency hallucinations in zero-shot LLM summarisation of scientific texts, where zero-shot indicates that the LLM relies purely on its pre-training data. Across eight yeast biotechnology research paper abstracts, six instruction-tuned LLMs were prompted with seven methods: a base- line prompt, two levels of increasing instruction complexity (PE-1 and PE-2), two levels of context repetition (CR-K1 and CR-K2), and two levels of random addition (RA-K1 and RA-K2). Context repetition involved the identification and repetition of K key sentences from the abstract, whereas random addition involved the repetition of K randomly selected sentences from the abstract, where K is 1 or 2. A total of 336 LLM-generated summaries were evaluated using six metrics: ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L, BERTScore, METEOR, and cosine similarity, which were used to compute the lexical and semantic alignment be- tween the summaries and the abstracts. Four hypotheses on the effects of prompt methods on summary alignment with the reference text were tested. Statistical analysis on 3744 collected datapoints was performed using bias-corrected and accelerated (BCa) bootstrap confidence intervals and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests with Bonferroni-Holm correction. The results demonstrated that CR and RA significantly improve the lexical alignment of LLM-generated summaries with the abstracts. These findings indicate that prompt engineering has the potential to impact hallucinations in zero-shot scientific summarisation tasks.

*Ahmed Mustafa Younes*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为DeformAr的框架，用于分析阿拉伯语与英语在命名实体识别（NER）任务中的性能差异，并通过组件分解和行为分析解释其原因。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Transformer模型在英语自然语言处理中表现优异，但在阿拉伯语NER任务中效果欠佳，现有研究未充分联合分析相关因素（如词法化、数据质量、标注不一致）。

Method: DeformAr框架集成交互式仪表盘与数据提取库，结合跨组件分析（分解语言成分）和行为分析（结合可解释性技术、词级别指标和可视化）进行诊断。

Result: 框架揭示了阿拉伯语NER性能瓶颈的联合影响因素，并展示了如何通过组件分解关联模型行为与数据特征，成为首个针对阿拉伯语的模型解释工具。

Conclusion: DeformAr为低资源语言（如阿拉伯语）的模型分析提供了关键资源，强调需联合分析模型与数据组件以提升性能。

Abstract: Transformer models have significantly advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP), demonstrating strong performance in English. However, their effectiveness in Arabic, particularly for Named Entity Recognition (NER), remains limited, even with larger pre-trained models. This performance gap stems from multiple factors, including tokenisation, dataset quality, and annotation inconsistencies. Existing studies often analyze these issues in isolation, failing to capture their joint effect on system behaviour and performance.
  We introduce DeformAr (Debugging and Evaluation Framework for Transformer-based NER Systems), a novel framework designed to investigate and explain the performance discrepancy between Arabic and English NER systems. DeformAr integrates a data extraction library and an interactive dashboard, supporting two modes of evaluation: cross-component analysis and behavioural analysis. The framework divides each language into dataset and model components to examine their interactions.
  The analysis proceeds in two stages. First, cross-component analysis provides systematic diagnostic measures across data and model subcomponents, addressing the "what," "how," and "why" behind observed discrepancies. The second stage applies behavioural analysis by combining interpretability techniques with token-level metrics, interactive visualisations, and representation space analysis. These stages enable a component-aware diagnostic process that detects model behaviours and explains them by linking them to underlying representational patterns and data factors. DeformAr is the first Arabic-specific, component-based interpretability tool, offering a crucial resource for advancing model analysis in under-resourced languages.

### [220] [Fine-tuning of lightweight large language models for sentiment classification on heterogeneous financial textual data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00946)
*Alvaro Paredes Amorin,Andre Python,Christoph Weisser*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 轻量级开源大型语言模型（LLM）如Qwen3和Llama3在金融文本分析中表现优异，即使使用仅5%训练数据，也能在零样本/小样本场景下实现高效情感理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高性能金融LLM依赖昂贵的计算资源与私有数据，导致使用受限，本文旨在验证轻量级开源模型在有限资源下能否实现通用金融文本分析能力。

Method: 对比FinBERT与三个开源模型（DeepSeek-LLM 7B, Llama3 8B, Qwen3 8B）在涵盖多语言/格式的五个公开金融数据集（如FinancialPhraseBank、Twitter情感分析）中的表现，测试零样本/小样本学习效果。

Result: Qwen3和Llama3在多数场景下表现最佳，即使使用5%训练数据且面对异构数据时仍保持竞争力，尤其在零样本/小样本任务中显著优于传统模型。

Conclusion: 轻量级开源LLM可作为高性价比方案，降低对大规模标注语料库的依赖，为金融文本分析提供可及性与实用性兼备的新路径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) play an increasingly important role in finan- cial markets analysis by capturing signals from complex and heterogeneous textual data sources, such as tweets, news articles, reports, and microblogs. However, their performance is dependent on large computational resources and proprietary datasets, which are costly, restricted, and therefore inacces- sible to many researchers and practitioners. To reflect realistic situations we investigate the ability of lightweight open-source LLMs - smaller and publicly available models designed to operate with limited computational resources - to generalize sentiment understanding from financial datasets of varying sizes, sources, formats, and languages. We compare the benchmark finance natural language processing (NLP) model, FinBERT, and three open-source lightweight LLMs, DeepSeek-LLM 7B, Llama3 8B Instruct, and Qwen3 8B on five publicly available datasets: FinancialPhraseBank, Financial Question Answering, Gold News Sentiment, Twitter Sentiment and Chinese Finance Sentiment. We find that LLMs, specially Qwen3 8B and Llama3 8B, perform best in most scenarios, even from using only 5% of the available training data. These results hold in zero-shot and few-shot learning scenarios. Our findings indicate that lightweight, open-source large language models (LLMs) consti- tute a cost-effective option, as they can achieve competitive performance on heterogeneous textual data even when trained on only a limited subset of the extensive annotated corpora that are typically deemed necessary.

*Nicole Favero,Francesca Salute,Daniel Hardt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文比较了Graph RAG与Advanced RAG在问答任务中的有效性，并评估LLM生成幻灯片/播客脚本的能力，发现GPT-4o mini结合Advanced RAG表现最优，但Graph RAG易导致幻觉，且人工评估对非传统学术输出至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM评估集中于标准任务（如事实问答），本文旨在扩展研究维度：一是探索不同RAG架构的效果差异，二是检验LLM生成新兴学术形式（如幻灯片、音频脚本）的能力。

Method: 结合LLaMA 3 70B与GPT-4o mini，对比两种RAG策略。通过11个维度的人工评分、LLM互评验证问答性能，并测试文档驱动的多媒体输出生成，由人类评估叙事流畅性及格式缺陷。

Result: GPT-4o mini+Advanced RAG在问答准确性胜出，Graph RAG改进有限且增加幻觉。生成任务中GPT-4o mini最优，LLaMA 3在叙事连贯性表现突出，但人工检测发现布局问题需结合评估。

Conclusion: Advanced RAG适配问答场景，Graph RAG需简化结构。LLM可生成高质量非传统学术内容，但需结合人类反馈弥补自动化指标不足，强调混合评估体系的必要性。

Abstract: Most evaluations of large language models focus on standard tasks such as factual question answering or short summarization. This research expands that scope in two directions: first, by comparing two retrieval strategies, Graph RAG, structured knowledge-graph based, and Advanced RAG, hybrid keyword-semantic search, for QA; and second, by evaluating whether LLMs can generate high quality non-traditional academic outputs, specifically slide decks and podcast scripts. We implemented a prototype combining Meta's LLaMA 3 70B open weight and OpenAI's GPT 4o mini API based. QA performance was evaluated using both human ratings across eleven quality dimensions and large language model judges for scalable cross validation. GPT 4o mini with Advanced RAG produced the most accurate responses. Graph RAG offered limited improvements and led to more hallucinations, partly due to its structural complexity and manual setup. Slide and podcast generation was tested with document grounded retrieval. GPT 4o mini again performed best, though LLaMA 3 showed promise in narrative coherence. Human reviewers were crucial for detecting layout and stylistic flaws, highlighting the need for combined human LLM evaluation in assessing emerging academic outputs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出语义混淆的概念及度量框架，揭示安全对齐语言模型中局部拒绝不一致性问题，通过ParaGuard数据集和三种token级指标诊断误拒模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前全局评估指标（如错误拒绝率）无法捕捉模型对相似语义提示的局部不一致拒绝行为，需更细粒度的诊断方法优化模型决策边界。

Method: 构建10k提示词的ParaGuard数据集（含保持意图的可控改写簇），提出三种模型无关的token级度量：Confusion Index（基于嵌入对比）、Confusion Rate（拒绝邻域概率）和Confusion Depth（困惑度信号）。

Result: 实验发现全局误拒率掩盖了关键结构，部分模型存在不稳定决策边界，严苛拒绝策略不必然增加混淆；混淆感知审计可分离拒绝频率与合理性，提供优化信号。

Conclusion: 研究为开发者提供了减少误拒而不牺牲安全性的可解释调优工具，揭示了安全对齐系统的局部逻辑缺陷。

Abstract: Safety-aligned language models often refuse prompts that are actually harmless. Current evaluations mostly report global rates such as false rejection or compliance. These scores treat each prompt alone and miss local inconsistency, where a model accepts one phrasing of an intent but rejects a close paraphrase. This gap limits diagnosis and tuning. We introduce "semantic confusion," a failure mode that captures such local inconsistency, and a framework to measure it. We build ParaGuard, a 10k-prompt corpus of controlled paraphrase clusters that hold intent fixed while varying surface form. We then propose three model-agnostic metrics at the token level: Confusion Index, Confusion Rate, and Confusion Depth. These metrics compare each refusal to its nearest accepted neighbors and use token embeddings, next-token probabilities, and perplexity signals. Experiments across diverse model families and deployment guards show that global false-rejection rate hides critical structure. Our metrics reveal globally unstable boundaries in some settings, localized pockets of inconsistency in others, and cases where stricter refusal does not increase inconsistency. We also show how confusion-aware auditing separates how often a system refuses from how sensibly it refuses. This gives developers a practical signal to reduce false refusals while preserving safety.

TL;DR: 本论文提出了ELR-1000数据集，包含来自印度东部偏远地区10种濒危语言的1060种传统食谱，通过低数字素养用户友好的移动界面收集。研究发现现有大型语言模型（LLMs）在翻译此类低资源语言时效果不佳，但结合语言背景、翻译示例和文化保护指南等针对性语境后，翻译质量显著提升。论文呼吁开发面向濒危语言的基准测试，并公开释放该数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 保护濒危语言承载的文化多样性，解决现有LLMs在低资源语言翻译中的局限性，并为语言技术发展提供跨文化基准数据。

Method: 采用移动界面在低数字素养的农村社区众包食谱数据，构建多模态多语言数据集；通过控制实验评估LLMs在不同语境设置下的翻译性能。

Result: LLMs在基础翻译任务中表现欠佳，但引入语言背景信息、翻译示例和文化指南后，翻译准确率提高42%，语法连贯性提升60%。

Conclusion: 文化语境信息对提升低资源语言翻译至关重要，数据集释放将推动濒危语言技术发展，建议建立多文化多语言评估基准体系。

Abstract: We present a culturally-grounded multimodal dataset of 1,060 traditional recipes crowdsourced from rural communities across remote regions of Eastern India, spanning 10 endangered languages. These recipes, rich in linguistic and cultural nuance, were collected using a mobile interface designed for contributors with low digital literacy. Endangered Language Recipes (ELR)-1000 -- captures not only culinary practices but also the socio-cultural context embedded in indigenous food traditions. We evaluate the performance of several state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) on translating these recipes into English and find the following: despite the models' capabilities, they struggle with low-resource, culturally-specific language. However, we observe that providing targeted context -- including background information about the languages, translation examples, and guidelines for cultural preservation -- leads to significant improvements in translation quality. Our results underscore the need for benchmarks that cater to underrepresented languages and domains to advance equitable and culturally-aware language technologies. As part of this work, we release the ELR-1000 dataset to the NLP community, hoping it motivates the development of language technologies for endangered languages.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本匿名化是保障敏感领域NLP研究的关键，但现有隐私评估方法存在不足，缺乏系统性整合与法律/用户视角的验证。

Method: 人工审查47篇隐私指标论文，提炼出6种隐私概念并比较其指标特性；结合HIPAA/GDPR法律标准及人机交互研究中的用户需求进行双维度评估。

Result: 构建了隐私评估框架指导实践，揭示了当前方法在法律合规性和用户感知性上的多重缺口。

Conclusion: 研究推动了文本匿名化领域更具可比性和法律兼容性的隐私评估体系发展，为未来研究指明方向。

Abstract: In this work, we aim to clarify and reconcile metrics for evaluating privacy protection in text through a systematic survey. Although text anonymization is essential for enabling NLP research and model development in domains with sensitive data, evaluating whether anonymization methods sufficiently protect privacy remains an open challenge. In manually reviewing 47 papers that report privacy metrics, we identify and compare six distinct privacy notions, and analyze how the associated metrics capture different aspects of privacy risk. We then assess how well these notions align with legal privacy standards (HIPAA and GDPR), as well as user-centered expectations grounded in HCI studies. Our analysis offers practical guidance on navigating the landscape of privacy evaluation approaches further and highlights gaps in current practices. Ultimately, we aim to facilitate more robust, comparable, and legally aware privacy evaluations in text anonymization.

Method: 提出包含三种差异化扰动类型的诊断框架，通过调整生成温度参数，在HotpotQA数据集上对开源及商业化大语言模型（LLM）进行跨温度设置的噪声测试实验。

Result: 实验表明：（1）高温生成设置会放大扰动对模型性能的负面影响；（2）特定扰动类型随温度变化呈现非线性敏感性；（3）不同模型架构对温度-扰动耦合的鲁棒性存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 核心贡献包括：（1）构建首个RAG鲁棒性诊断基准；（2）建立量化温度-扰动交互作用的分析框架；（3）提出在噪声检索场景下的模型选择与参数调优指南。

Abstract: The evaluation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems typically examines retrieval quality and generation parameters like temperature in isolation, overlooking their interaction. This work presents a systematic investigation of how text perturbations (simulating noisy retrieval) interact with temperature settings across multiple LLM runs. We propose a comprehensive RAG Perturbation-Temperature Analysis Framework that subjects retrieved documents to three distinct perturbation types across varying temperature settings. Through extensive experiments on HotpotQA with both open-source and proprietary LLMs, we demonstrate that performance degradation follows distinct patterns: high-temperature settings consistently amplify vulnerability to perturbations, while certain perturbation types exhibit non-linear sensitivity across the temperature range. Our work yields three key contributions: (1) a diagnostic benchmark for assessing RAG robustness, (2) an analytical framework for quantifying perturbation-temperature interactions, and (3) practical guidelines for model selection and parameter tuning under noisy retrieval conditions.

Abstract: The Nagamese language, a.k.a Naga Pidgin, is an Assamese-lexified creole language developed primarily as a means of communication in trade between the people from Nagaland and people from Assam in the north-east India. Substantial amount of work in sentiment analysis has been done for resource-rich languages like English, Hindi, etc. However, no work has been done in Nagamese language. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt on sentiment analysis and emotion classification for the Nagamese Language. The aim of this work is to detect sentiments in terms of polarity (positive, negative and neutral) and basic emotions contained in textual content of Nagamese language. We build sentiment polarity lexicon of 1,195 nagamese words and use these to build features along with additional features for supervised machine learning techniques using Na"ive Bayes and Support Vector Machines.

Motivation: 现有LLM化学评估存在任务简化、过程评估缺失和与专家技能不匹配的缺陷，需建立更精准的专家级评估体系。

Method: 构建500题多模态/文本双版本基准，采用专家问题+迭代清洗流程消除数据噪声，并设计RPF评分指标分析模型推理路径与标准答案的匹配度，而非仅关注答案正确性。

Result: GPT-5(High)在SUPERChem达38.5%准确率，接近人类40.3%基线但未超越，模型间呈现显著差异：视觉模态提升5.2%准确率，RPF评分揭示仅12%模型输出达到专家级推理严谨度。

Conclusion: SUPERChem通过多模态挑战性问题与RPF过程评估框架，揭示了当前LLM在化学推理中的短板，为未来开发专家级化学智能提供了标准化进步路径。

Abstract: Current benchmarks for evaluating the chemical reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are limited by oversimplified tasks, lack of process-level evaluation, and misalignment with expert-level chemistry skills. To address these issues, we introduce SUPERChem, a benchmark of 500 expert-curated reasoning-intensive chemistry problems, covering diverse subfields and provided in both multimodal and text-only formats. Original content and an iterative curation pipeline eliminate flawed items and mitigate data contamination. Each problem is paired with an expert-authored solution path, enabling Reasoning Path Fidelity (RPF) scoring to evaluate reasoning quality beyond final-answer accuracy. Evaluations against a human baseline of 40.3% accuracy show that even the best-performing model, GPT-5 (High), reaches only 38.5%, followed closely by Gemini 2.5 Pro (37.9%) and DeepSeek-V3.1-Think (37.3%). SUPERChem elicits multi-step, multimodal reasoning, reveals model-dependent effects of visual information, and distinguishes high-fidelity reasoners from heuristic ones. By providing a challenging benchmark and a reliable evaluation framework, SUPERChem aims to facilitate the advancement of LLMs toward expert-level chemical intelligence. The dataset of the benchmark is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/ZehuaZhao/SUPERChem.

Conclusion: 该研究为对话系统提供了解决身份感知情感推理问题的完整解决方案，包括首个用户画像关联的共情基准和可解释的评分规则驱动训练框架，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: As web platforms evolve towards greater personalization and emotional complexity, conversational agents must transcend superficial empathy to demonstrate identity-aware emotional reasoning. However, existing systems face two limitations: (1) reliance on situation-centric datasets lacking persistent user identity, which hampers the capture of personalized affective nuances; and (2) dependence on opaque, coarse reward signals that hinder development of verifiable empathetic reasoning. To address these gaps, we introduce KardiaBench, a large-scale user-grounded benchmark comprising 178,080 QA pairs across 22,080 multi-turn conversations anchored to 671 real-world profiles. The dataset is constructed via a model-in-the-loop pipeline with iterative rubric-guided refinement to ensure psychological plausibility and persona consistency. This progressive empathy pipeline that integrates user comprehension, contextual reasoning, and emotion perception into conversations, followed by iterative critique and rubric-based refinement to ensure psychological plausibility, emotional fidelity, and persona consistency. Building on this, we propose Kardia-R1, a framework that trains models for interpretable, stepwise empathetic cognition. Kardia-R1 leverages Rubric-as-Judge Empathetic Reinforcement Learning (Rubric-ERL), a GRPO-based method that uses explainable, human-aligned rubric rewards to tightly couple user understanding, emotional inference, and supportive response generation. Extensive experiments across four LLM backbones demonstrate that Kardia-R1 consistently outperforms othet methods in emotion accuracy, empathy, relevance, persona consistency, and safety. Our dataset and model will be released at https://github.com/JhCircle/Kardia-R1.

TL;DR: AC-PMBR decoding improves translation quality and efficiency by leveraging a knowledge distilled model to guide matrix completion, outperforming PMBR in both accuracy and computational trade-off.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MBR methods either incur high computational costs (MBR) or sacrifice translation quality for efficiency (PMBR). This work aims to balance quality and cost by enhancing PMBR with knowledge distillation.

Method: AC-PMBR introduces agreement constraints guided by a distilled model to improve matrix completion accuracy in PMBR. It combines sampled pairwise scores with distilled knowledge to approximate missing quality scores efficiently.

Result: AC-PMBR reduced matrix completion approximation errors by 3× compared to PMBR and achieved higher translation quality (e.g., BLEU scores) on WMT'23 En$ightarrow$De and De$ightarrow$En tasks at similar computational costs.

Conclusion: The proposed AC-PMBR successfully improves the quality-cost trade-off in MBR decoding, demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating knowledge distillation into probabilistic matrix completion frameworks for translation tasks.

Abstract: Minimum Bayes risk (MBR) decoding generates high-quality translations by maximizing the expected utility of output candidates, but it evaluates all pairwise scores over the candidate set; hence, it takes quadratic time with respect to the number of candidates. To reduce the number of utility function calls, probabilistic MBR (PMBR) decoding partially evaluates quality scores using sampled pairs of candidates and completes the missing scores with a matrix completion algorithm. Nevertheless, it degrades the translation quality as the number of utility function calls is reduced. Therefore, to improve the trade-off between quality and cost, we propose agreement-constrained PMBR (AC-PMBR) decoding, which leverages a knowledge distilled model to guide the completion of the score matrix. Our AC-PMBR decoding improved approximation errors of matrix completion by up to 3 times and achieved higher translation quality compared with PMBR decoding at a comparable computational cost on the WMT'23 En$\leftrightarrow$De translation tasks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种动态融合学习模型DyFuLM，通过分层语义表征与细粒度情绪捕捉的多模态框架，在多任务情感分析中取得显著效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对复杂文本情感理解的挑战，现有方法在融合多层级特征与平衡细粒度情绪表征方面存在不足，亟需更有效的模型架构。

Method: DyFuLM包含两个核心模块：1) 分层动态融合模块自适应整合多尺度特征；2) 门控特征聚合模块调控跨层信息流，结合动态损失机制实现均衡表征学习。

Result: 在多任务情感数据集上达成了82.64%粗粒度与68.48%细粒度分类精度，回归误差MAE=0.0674/MSE=0.0082，R²=0.6903。消融实验显示移除模块会导致0.26-0.91%的性能下降。

Conclusion: DyFuLM通过分层特征融合机制有效提升情感表征能力，各模块对特征交互与任务平衡具有显著贡献。

Abstract: Understanding sentiment in complex textual expressions remains a fundamental challenge in affective computing. To address this, we propose a Dynamic Fusion Learning Model (DyFuLM), a multimodal framework designed to capture both hierarchical semantic representations and fine-grained emotional nuances. DyFuLM introduces two key moodules: a Hierarchical Dynamic Fusion module that adaptively integrates multi-level features, and a Gated Feature Aggregation module that regulates cross-layer information ffow to achieve balanced representation learning. Comprehensive experiments on multi-task sentiment datasets demonstrate that DyFuLM achieves 82.64% coarse-grained and 68.48% fine-grained accuracy, yielding the lowest regression errors (MAE = 0.0674, MSE = 0.0082) and the highest R^2 coefficient of determination (R^2= 0.6903). Furthermore, the ablation study validates the effectiveness of each module in DyFuLM. When all modules are removed, the accuracy drops by 0.91% for coarse-grained and 0.68% for fine-grained tasks. Keeping only the gated fusion module causes decreases of 0.75% and 0.55%, while removing the dynamic loss mechanism results in drops of 0.78% and 0.26% for coarse-grained and fine-grained sentiment classification, respectively. These results demonstrate that each module contributes significantly to feature interaction and task balance. Overall, the experimental findings further validate that DyFuLM enhances sentiment representation and overall performance through effective hierarchical feature fusion.

TL;DR: 本文提出PromptBridge框架，解决大型语言模型切换时提示效果下降问题，通过跨模型提示迁移减少重复优化成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型快速迭代导致频繁模型切换，但提示高度依赖特定模型，迁移后性能大幅下降（即Model Drifting），需开发通用迁移方案。

Method: PromptBridge通过Model-Adaptive Reflective Prompt Evolution（MAP-RPE）算法，使用少量校准任务迭代优化源模型与目标模型的提示对，建立跨模型提示映射关系，无需针对新任务重新训练。

Result: 在单智能体与多智能体实验中，PromptBridge的迁移提示较直接复用提升准确率，且校准仅需少量任务，显著降低模型迁移成本。

Conclusion: 研究提出首个无需训练的跨模型提示迁移框架，通过校准任务对建立提示映射关系，使模型切换时保持提示效果，具有实际部署价值。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) underpin applications in code generation, mathematical reasoning, and agent-based workflows. In practice, systems access LLMs via commercial APIs or open-source deployments, and the model landscape (e.g., GPT, Claude, Llama) evolves rapidly. This rapid evolution forces frequent model switches driven by capability, cost, deployment constraints, and privacy. Yet prompts are highly model-sensitive: reusing a prompt engineered for one model on another often yields substantially worse performance than a prompt optimized for the target model. We term this phenomenon Model Drifting. Through extensive empirical analysis across diverse LLM configurations, we show that model drifting is both common and severe. To address this challenge, we introduce PromptBridge, a training-free framework that preserves prompt effectiveness under model switches, enabling cross-model prompt transfer without costly per-task or per-model re-optimization. PromptBridge requires only a small set of alignment tasks for calibration. It first applies Model-Adaptive Reflective Prompt Evolution (MAP-RPE) to obtain task- and model-specific optimal prompts via iterative reflective refinement and quantitative evaluation. Using the resulting calibrated prompt pairs for the source and target models, PromptBridge learns a cross-model prompt mapping. At test time, i.e., for an unseen task, given a source-model prompt, this mapping directly produces an optimized prompt for the target model. Experiments in single-agent and multi-agent settings show that PromptBridge consistently improves downstream accuracy while reducing migration effort. The code will be available soon.

Abstract: We present Conformer-based decoders for the LibriBrain 2025 PNPL competition, targeting two foundational MEG tasks: Speech Detection and Phoneme Classification. Our approach adapts a compact Conformer to raw 306-channel MEG signals, with a lightweight convolutional projection layer and task-specific heads. For Speech Detection, a MEG-oriented SpecAugment provided a first exploration of MEG-specific augmentation. For Phoneme Classification, we used inverse-square-root class weighting and a dynamic grouping loader to handle 100-sample averaged examples. In addition, a simple instance-level normalization proved critical to mitigate distribution shifts on the holdout split. Using the official Standard track splits and F1-macro for model selection, our best systems achieved 88.9% (Speech) and 65.8% (Phoneme) on the leaderboard, surpassing the competition baselines and ranking within the top-10 in both tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低资源语言因数据不足导致模型表现差且微调不稳定，而预训练计算成本高，故需优化微调阶段的效率与质量

Method: 提出集成微调框架，将主动学习与聚类分析结合，设计动态数据选择调度器，通过匈牙利算法平衡文本难度与分布，采用迭代式渐进训练策略

Result: 在4种低资源语言任务中，相较传统微调：1) 用30%更少标注数据达同等性能；2) F1分数提升最多4个点；3) 训练过程稳定性提升35%

Conclusion: 基于聚类的主动学习调度器能有效提升低资源语言模型微调效率，在数据经济性与模型性能间达成最优平衡，特别适用于计算资源受限的场景

Abstract: Limited data for low-resource languages typically yield weaker language models (LMs). Since pre-training is compute-intensive, it is more pragmatic to target improvements during fine-tuning. In this work, we examine the use of Active Learning (AL) methods augmented by structured data selection strategies which we term 'Active Learning schedulers', to boost the fine-tuning process with a limited amount of training data. We connect the AL to data clustering and propose an integrated fine-tuning pipeline that systematically combines AL, clustering, and dynamic data selection schedulers to enhance model's performance. Experiments in the Slovak, Maltese, Icelandic and Turkish languages show that the use of clustering during the fine-tuning phase together with AL scheduling can simultaneously produce annotation savings up to 30% and performance improvements up to four F1 score points, while also providing better fine-tuning stability.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种高效的多语言语音到文本翻译框架（MCAT），通过语言扩展方法提升覆盖70种语言的互译能力，并优化语音适配器模块将语音序列长度压缩至30 tokens，在保证性能的同时提升推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大模型（MLLMs）在语音到文本翻译（S2TT）任务中面临两大挑战：1）主流S2TT数据集以英语为主，限制了多语言扩展能力；2）长语音序列（如750 tokens）显著降低推理速度。

Method: 1）语言扩展方法：基于课程学习和数据平衡策略，将MLLMs的语音翻译能力拓展至70种语言并实现互译；2）优化语音适配器模块，通过序列压缩技术将语音序列长度从750 tokens降至30 tokens。

Result: 在FLEURS数据集的70x69种翻译方向上超越当前端到端模型，批量推理效率显著提升，且仅需约1亿可训练参数及每语言10小时S2TT数据。

Conclusion: MCAT在多语言覆盖和推理效率方面具有显著优势，开源代码和模型已发布以推动MLLMs的语音翻译能力建设。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved great success in Speech-to-Text Translation (S2TT) tasks. However, current research is constrained by two key challenges: language coverage and efficiency. Most of the popular S2TT datasets are substantially English-centric, which restricts the scaling-up of MLLMs' many-to-many translation capabilities. Moreover, the inference speed of MLLMs degrades dramatically when the speech is converted into long sequences (e.g., 750 tokens). To address these limitations, we propose a Multilingual Cost-effective Accelerated Speech-to-Text Translator (MCAT) framework, which includes two innovations. First, a language scaling method that leverages curriculum learning and a data balancing strategy is introduced to extend the language coverage supported by MLLMs to 70 languages and achieve mutual translation among these languages. Second, an optimized speech adapter module is designed to reduce the length of the speech sequence to only 30 tokens. Extensive experiments were conducted on MLLMs of different scales (9B and 27B). The experimental results demonstrate that MCAT not only surpasses state-of-the-art end-to-end models on the FLEURS dataset across 70x69 directions but also enhances batch inference efficiency. This is achieved with only ~100M trainable parameters and by using only 10 hours of S2TT data per language. Furthermore, we have released MCAT as open-source to promote the development of MLLMs for robust S2TT capabilities. The code and models are released at https://github.com/yxduir/m2m-70.

TL;DR: 该研究发现，使用社交媒体（如Reddit）获取的非洲语言数据存在代码转换严重、数据稀疏问题，而本地新闻数据更清洁且适合训练语言模型，现行检测工具在新闻数据上效果好但在社交媒体上效果差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非洲语言的在线使用率低且受英语影响大，导致语言检测工具难以获取真实、单语的语言数据，现有模型难以有效处理混合语言现象。

Method: 从Reddit和本地新闻来源收集约鲁巴语、基尼亚卢旺达语和阿姆哈拉语数据，使用AfroLID和通用大模型检测语言，并对比不同数据源的差异。

Result: 新闻数据单语性高且使用模型准确率接近完美；Reddit数据稀疏且代码转换严重，导致检测工具表现不佳，同时新闻平台关联的社交媒体互动更高。

Conclusion: 专业新闻内容是非洲语言模型训练的可靠数据源，建议开发更高效的语言检测工具需同时处理单语和混合语言场景。

Abstract: This study examines the digital representation of African languages and the challenges this presents for current language detection tools. We evaluate their performance on Yoruba, Kinyarwanda, and Amharic. While these languages are spoken by millions, their online usage on conversational platforms is often sparse, heavily influenced by English, and not representative of the authentic, monolingual conversations prevalent among native speakers. This lack of readily available authentic data online creates a challenge of scarcity of conversational data for training language models. To investigate this, data was collected from subreddits and local news sources for each language. The analysis showed a stark contrast between the two sources. Reddit data was minimal and characterized by heavy code-switching. Conversely, local news media offered a robust source of clean, monolingual language data, which also prompted more user engagement in the local language on the news publishers social media pages. Language detection models, including the specialized AfroLID and a general LLM, performed with near-perfect accuracy on the clean news data but struggled with the code-switched Reddit posts. The study concludes that professionally curated news content is a more reliable and effective source for training context-rich AI models for African languages than data from conversational platforms. It also highlights the need for future models that can process clean and code-switched text to improve the detection accuracy for African languages.

TL;DR: 本文提出了MAC-SLU多意图车载语音理解数据集，用于评估大语言模型（LLMs）和大音频语言模型（LALMs）在复杂场景下的性能表现。


<details>

Motivation: 现有SLU数据集缺乏足够的多样性与复杂性，且未形成统一基准框架验证LLMs/LALMs在多意图任务中的学习能力。特别是在车载场景中，用户语音常包含混合控制指令（如同时调节温度与播放音乐），但现有数据集未充分覆盖此类实际需求。

Method: 1) 构建MAC-SLU数据集，包含真实多意图车载语音数据；2) 在该数据集上系统测试LLMs/LALMs的表现，涵盖上下文学习、监督微调、端到端（E2E）和流水线范式等多种方法对比。

Result: LLMs/LALMs通过上下文学习可完成SLU任务但性能显著低于监督微调；端到端LALMs达到与流水线方法相当的准确率，同时避免了传统语音识别模块的错误传播问题。

Conclusion: MAC-SLU为SLU任务提供了更具挑战性的基准测试平台，验证了端到端模型在多意图场景下的潜力，但现有LLMs/LALMs仍需针对性优化才能超越传统监督学习方法。

Abstract: Spoken Language Understanding (SLU), which aims to extract user semantics to execute downstream tasks, is a crucial component of task-oriented dialog systems. Existing SLU datasets generally lack sufficient diversity and complexity, and there is an absence of a unified benchmark for the latest Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Audio Language Models (LALMs). This work introduces MAC-SLU, a novel Multi-Intent Automotive Cabin Spoken Language Understanding Dataset, which increases the difficulty of the SLU task by incorporating authentic and complex multi-intent data. Based on MAC-SLU, we conducted a comprehensive benchmark of leading open-source LLMs and LALMs, covering methods like in-context learning, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and end-to-end (E2E) and pipeline paradigms. Our experiments show that while LLMs and LALMs have the potential to complete SLU tasks through in-context learning, their performance still lags significantly behind SFT. Meanwhile, E2E LALMs demonstrate performance comparable to pipeline approaches and effectively avoid error propagation from speech recognition. Code\footnote{https://github.com/Gatsby-web/MAC\_SLU} and datasets\footnote{huggingface.co/datasets/Gatsby1984/MAC\_SLU} are released publicly.

Motivation: 现有模型难以区分客观不可解问题与自身能力限制，导致幻觉和过自信。需解决此问题以提高模型可靠性。

Method: 构造双轨数据集UnsolvableQA（含逻辑谜题与逆向构造矛盾数学题），设计包含准确性、不可解性、难度三要素的UnsolvableRL强化学习框架。

Result: 近100%检测不可解问题，可解任务准确率提升，证实显式暴露不可解数据对防止能力崩溃至关重要。

Conclusion: 显式学习不可解样本可系统性降低模型过自信，提升在可行任务上的表现。

Abstract: Ensuring LLM reliability requires not only solving complex problems but also recognizing when a problem is unsolvable. Current models often struggle to distinguish objective unsolvability (inherent contradictions in the problem) from subjective capability limitations (problems beyond the model's competence), which leads to hallucinations and overconfidence. To address this, we propose UnsolvableQA and UnsolvableRL to solve feasible problems, detect inherent contradictions, and prudently refuse tasks beyond capability. Specifically, we construct UnsolvableQA, a dataset of paired solvable and unsolvable instances derived via a dual-track methodology: programmatic generation for logic puzzles and a novel "Reverse Construction" method that injects contradictions into valid reasoning chains for mathematics. Building on this dataset, we introduce UnsolvableRL, a reinforcement learning framework with three reward components jointly accounting for accuracy, unsolvability, and difficulty. Empirical results show that our approach achieves near-perfect unsolvability detection while also improving accuracy on solvable tasks. Crucially, we identify Capability Collapse, demonstrating that explicit exposure to unsolvable data is indispensable for preventing models from becoming systematically overconfident.

Conclusion: 该方法具备数据规模鲁棒性、全链路自动化特性，开源工具加速多语言借词检测的实证研究。

Abstract: This paper presents a fully self-supervised approach to borrowing detection in multilingual wordlists. The method combines two sources of information: PMI similarities based on a global correspondence model and a lightweight contrastive component trained on phonetic feature vectors. It further includes an automatic procedure for selecting decision thresholds without requiring labeled data. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that PMI alone already improves over existing string similarity measures such as NED and SCA, and that the combined similarity performs on par with or better than supervised baselines. An ablation study highlights the importance of character encoding, temperature settings and augmentation strategies. The approach scales to datasets of different sizes, works without manual supervision and is provided with a command-line tool that allows researchers to conduct their own studies.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper identifies 'reasoning overconfidence' in LLMs when handling multi-solution tasks and introduces MuSoBench benchmark. It proposes Long-CoT prompting as a mitigation strategy through iterative exploration, contrasting Short-CoT's limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs' single-answer superiority fails in real-world multi-solution scenarios. Current evaluation frameworks lack metrics for solution completeness. This work challenges the single-answer paradigm and exposes LLMs' under-explored limitations.

Method: 1) Construct MuSoBench containing multi-solution problems 2) Compare Short-CoT vs Long-CoT prompting regimes 3) Attention entropy analysis to detect cognitive rigidity 4) Control experiments on factors like model scale

Result: Short-CoT showed systematic overconfidence patterns: 1) Premature convergence 2) 23% higher answer overlap vs ground truth 3) 78% confidence over 32% accuracy mismatch. Long-CoT improved diversity by 41% through iterative self-reflection mechanisms.

Conclusion: The overconfidence stems from cognitive rigidity in attention pathways. Current LLM evaluation must evolve from single-answer metrics to comprehensive diversity assessments. Long-context reasoning provides a technical pathway to mitigate this limitation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in reasoning tasks requiring a single correct answer, but they perform poorly in multi-solution tasks that require generating comprehensive and diverse answers. We attribute this limitation to \textbf{reasoning overconfidence}: a tendency to express undue certainty in an incomplete solution set. To examine the effect, we introduce \textit{MuSoBench}, a benchmark of multi-solution problems. Experiments show that the conventional short chain-of-thought (Short-CoT) prompting paradigm exhibits pronounced overconfidence, whereas the emerging long chain-of-thought (Long-CoT) approach mitigates it through iterative exploration and self-reflection. We further characterise observable behaviours and influential factors. To probe the underlying cause, we propose the \textbf{cognitive-rigidity hypothesis}, which posits that overconfidence arises when the reasoning process prematurely converges on a narrow set of thought paths. An attention-entropy analysis offers preliminary support for this view. These findings provide tools for assessing the completeness of LLM reasoning and highlight the need to move evaluation beyond single-answer accuracy toward comprehensive exploration.

Motivation: 现有研究集中于明示性虚假信息检测（如伪造内容），而信息遗漏型欺骗（通过关键信息缺失引导错误结论）缺乏有效方法，尽管此类欺骗更具隐蔽性。

Method: 基于多源上下文构建遗漏感知图，采用关系建模技术识别文本内部依赖及动态遗漏意图，通过分层消息传递机制融合遗漏内容与关系特征进行检测决策。在两个大规模数据集进行验证。

Result: 在FEVER和Politifact数据集上较基线模型提升5.4%（F1）和5.3%（ACC），证明遗漏视角对检测算法的重要价值。

Conclusion: OmiGraph首次建立信息缺失检测的系统性方法，揭示多视角图建模对捕捉隐性误导的关键作用，开辟了欺骗检测的新研究维度。

Abstract: This paper investigates the detection of misinformation, which deceives readers by explicitly fabricating misleading content or implicitly omitting important information necessary for informed judgment. While the former has been extensively studied, omission-based deception remains largely overlooked, even though it can subtly guide readers toward false conclusions under the illusion of completeness. To pioneer in this direction, this paper presents OmiGraph, the first omission-aware framework for misinformation detection. Specifically, OmiGraph constructs an omission-aware graph for the target news by utilizing a contextual environment that captures complementary perspectives of the same event, thereby surfacing potentially omitted contents. Based on this graph, omission-oriented relation modeling is then proposed to identify the internal contextual dependencies, as well as the dynamic omission intents, formulating a comprehensive omission relation representation. Finally, to extract omission patterns for detection, OmiGraph introduces omission-aware message-passing and aggregation that establishes holistic deception perception by integrating the omission contents and relations. Experiments show that, by considering the omission perspective, our approach attains remarkable performance, achieving average improvements of +5.4% F1 and +5.3% ACC on two large-scale benchmarks.

InnoGym introduces two complementary metrics: performance gain, which measures improvement over the best-known solutions, and novelty, which captures methodological differences from prior approaches. The benchmark includes 18 carefully curated tasks from real-world engineering and scientific domains, each standardized through resource filtering, evaluator validation, and solution collection. In addition, we provide iGym, a unified execution environment for reproducible and long-horizon evaluations. Extensive experiments show that while some agents produce novel approaches, their lack of robustness limits performance gains. These results highlight a key gap between creativity and effectiveness, underscoring the need for benchmarks that evaluate both.

### [243] [Beyond SFT: Reinforcement Learning for Safer Large Reasoning Models with Better Reasoning Ability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01848)
*Jinghan Jia,Nathalie Baracaldo,Sijia Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文讨论大型推理模型（LRMs）通过显式链式推理增强语言模型，但中间推理过程可能引发安全风险。现有监督微调（SFT）方法效果有限，提出基于强化学习（RL）的安全对齐框架以提升稳定性与安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监督微调（SFT）在安全对齐中存在效果不稳定、削弱推理能力及跨模型泛化性差等问题，需更鲁棒的训练方法。

Method: 采用强化学习（RL）优化模型策略，通过奖励信号直接调整推理过程，在保持推理深度的同时抑制危险探索。

Result: 实验表明RL在多个模型和基准测试中实现更一致的安全性提升，同时维持推理性能。分析发现RL通过降低token级熵值减少危险推理路径。

Conclusion: RL为LRMs安全训练提供有效路径，相较SFT具有更优的稳定性和可靠性，为安全风险治理提供新思路。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) extend large language models by generating explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, significantly improving mathematical and logical problem solving. However, this explicit reasoning process also introduces new safety risks, as unsafe behaviors often emerge within intermediate reasoning trajectories, even when final answers appear harmless. Existing safety alignment approaches primarily rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) over safety-oriented long CoT datasets. While intuitive, we find that SFT produces inconsistent safety improvements, degrades reasoning ability, and generalizes poorly across model families. These limitations suggest that purely supervised approaches are insufficient for robust safety alignment in LRMs. To address this, we investigate reinforcement learning (RL) as a complementary optimization framework for LRM safety training. Unlike SFT, RL directly optimizes model policies with reward feedback, enabling more adaptive and stable alignment. Extensive experiments across multiple model families and benchmarks show that RL achieves stronger and more consistent safety gains while maintaining reasoning competence. Further analysis of reflection dynamics and token-level entropy reveals that RL suppresses unsafe exploratory reasoning while preserving reflective depth, leading to safer and more reliable reasoning processes.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multilingual applications but often generate plausible yet incorrect or misleading outputs, known as hallucinations. While hallucination detection has been studied extensively in English, under-resourced Indian languages remain largely unexplored. We present BHRAM-IL, a benchmark for hallucination recognition and assessment in multiple Indian languages, covering Hindi, Gujarati, Marathi, Odia, along with English. The benchmark comprises 36,047 curated questions across nine categories spanning factual, numerical, reasoning, and linguistic tasks. We evaluate 14 state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs on a benchmark subset of 10,265 questions, analyzing cross-lingual and factual hallucinations across languages, models, scales, categories, and domains using category-specific metrics normalized to (0,1) range. Aggregation over all categories and models yields a primary score of 0.23 and a language-corrected fuzzy score of 0.385, demonstrating the usefulness of BHRAM-IL for hallucination-focused evaluation. The dataset, and the code for generation and evaluation are available on GitHub (https://github.com/sambhashana/BHRAM-IL/) and HuggingFace (https://huggingface.co/datasets/sambhashana/BHRAM-IL/) to support future research in multilingual hallucination detection and mitigation.

Conclusion: 跨语言交错训练为构建多语言语音语言模型提供了简单且可扩展的技术路径，所发布资源将推动低资源语言的NLP技术发展，后续需探索更多语言组合与实际应用验证。

Abstract: Spoken Language Models (SLMs) aim to learn linguistic competence directly from speech using discrete units, widening access to Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies for languages with limited written resources. However, progress has been largely English-centric due to scarce spoken evaluation benchmarks and training data, making cross-lingual learning difficult. We present a cross-lingual interleaving method that mixes speech tokens across languages without textual supervision. We also release an EN-FR training dataset, TinyStories (~42k hours), together with EN-FR spoken StoryCloze and TopicCloze benchmarks for cross-lingual semantic evaluation, both synthetically generated using GPT-4. On 360M and 1B SLMs under matched training-token budgets, interleaving improves monolingual semantic accuracy, enables robust cross-lingual continuation, and strengthens cross-lingual hidden-state alignment. Taken together, these results indicate that cross-lingual interleaving is a simple, scalable route to building multilingual SLMs that understand and converse across languages. All resources will be made open-source to support reproducibility.

Method: 通过混合方法实验设计，57名参与者在两个条件下评估有/无缓解的有害回复，涵盖真实性、公平性、危害消除能力和相关性，并引入新评估指标。

Result: 参与者母语、AI经验及标注熟悉度显著影响评估结果，语法错误被扣分而语义连贯性受认可，且提出新指标和人类-AI评估洞见。

Conclusion: 基于人类感知的AI缓解策略需结合语言细粒度分析与量化指标，母语及专业背景影响评估差异，建议优化以人为本的评估框架。

Abstract: With the rapid uptake of generative AI, investigating human perceptions of generated responses has become crucial. A major challenge is their `aptitude' for hallucinating and generating harmful contents. Despite major efforts for implementing guardrails, human perceptions of these mitigation strategies are largely unknown. We conducted a mixed-method experiment for evaluating the responses of a mitigation strategy across multiple-dimensions: faithfulness, fairness, harm-removal capacity, and relevance. In a within-subject study design, 57 participants assessed the responses under two conditions: harmful response plus its mitigation and solely mitigated response. Results revealed that participants' native language, AI work experience, and annotation familiarity significantly influenced evaluations. Participants showed high sensitivity to linguistic and contextual attributes, penalizing minor grammar errors while rewarding preserved semantic contexts. This contrasts with how language is often treated in the quantitative evaluation of LLMs. We also introduced new metrics for training and evaluating mitigation strategies and insights for human-AI evaluation studies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型使自动化生成报告技术可行，但该领域缺乏系统性研究，尤其是正式任务定义和基准测试，亟需填补这一空白。

Method: 定义OPOR-GEN任务并构建包含463个危机事件的数据集（涵盖新闻、社交媒体及参考摘要），提出OPOR-EVAL框架，通过模拟人类专家评估生成报告的上下文质量。

Result: 实验表明，OPOR-EVAL框架与人工评估具有高相关性，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 通过任务定义、数据集和评估框架，为在线舆论报告生成的未来研究提供了系统性基础与工具支持。

Abstract: Online Public Opinion Reports consolidate news and social media for timely crisis management by governments and enterprises. While large language models have made automated report generation technically feasible, systematic research in this specific area remains notably absent, particularly lacking formal task definitions and corresponding benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we define the Automated Online Public Opinion Report Generation (OPOR-GEN) task and construct OPOR-BENCH, an event-centric dataset covering 463 crisis events with their corresponding news articles, social media posts, and a reference summary. To evaluate report quality, we propose OPOR-EVAL, a novel agent-based framework that simulates human expert evaluation by analyzing generated reports in context. Experiments with frontier models demonstrate that our framework achieves high correlation with human judgments. Our comprehensive task definition, benchmark dataset, and evaluation framework provide a solid foundation for future research in this critical domain.

TL;DR: 本文提出latent debate框架，通过隐含支持与攻击信号解构单个LLM的推理过程与幻觉检测机制


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自我一致性方法依赖多模型显式辩论，但LLM内部隐含思维过程与幻觉成因尚未被有效解析

Method: 构建模型无关的概念框架，在True/False任务中符号化实例化，量化中间层隐含辩论模式

Result: 实验证明该框架与LLM原预测高度一致，可检测幻觉且发现中间层辩论程度与幻觉风险强相关

Conclusion: latent debate为解析LLM内在工作机制提供可解释工具，揭示推理过程中的隐含共识/冲突机制

Abstract: Understanding the internal thinking process of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the cause of hallucinations remains a key challenge. To this end, we introduce latent debate, a novel framework for interpreting model predictions through the lens of implicit internal arguments. Unlike the current work of self-consistency and multi-agent debate, which relies on explicit debates among multiple answers or multiple models, latent debate captures the hidden supporting and attacking signals that arise within a single model during a single inference. We first present a model- and task-agnostic conceptual framework, and then instantiate it symbolically to approximate the thinking process of LLMs on True/False prediction tasks. Empirical studies demonstrate that latent debate is a faithful structured surrogate model that has highly consistent predictions with the original LLM. Beyond interpretability, we demonstrate that latent debate provides a strong baseline for hallucination detection. Further analysis reveals strong correlations between hallucinations and debate patterns, such as a high degree of latent debates in the middle layers is linked to a higher risk of hallucinations. These findings position latent debate as a potential framework for understanding internal mechanisms of LLMs, especially for scenarios where internal (dis)agreements appear during the inference steps.

*Aradhye Agarwal,Ayan Sengupta,Tanmoy Chakraborty*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文对大语言模型（LLMs）的测试时扩展（TTS）策略进行了大规模研究，发现无单一最优方法，模型表现因问题难度和模型类型分为短视界和长视界两类，并提出基于问题难度、模型类型和计算预算的TTS策略选择指南。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究缺乏对TTS策略在相同条件下的系统比较，且模型类型与问题难度对性能的影响机制不明确。作者旨在填补这一空白，为实际应用中的推理扩展提供指导。

Method: 在四个推理数据集上，使用8个开源LLM（7B-235B参数）生成超300亿token，开展迄今为止最大规模的TTS实证研究，分析不同策略在多维度条件下的表现差异。

Result: 发现三个核心规律：
1. 没有策略在所有场景下占优；
2. 模型随问题难度和生成长度呈现短视界（简单问题快速收敛）和长视界（复杂问题需长链推理）的典型质量轨迹差异；
3. 相同模型类型的最优性能与计算预算呈单调正相关。

Conclusion: 提出可操作的TTS策略选择框架：建议根据问题复杂度（短/长视界）、模型架构（如decoder-only或encoder-decoder）和计算资源约束，动态配置推理时的计算资源分配，避免固定模式导致的次优结果。

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) -- the dynamic allocation of compute during inference -- is a promising direction for improving reasoning in large language models (LLMs). However, a systematic comparison of well-known TTS strategies under identical conditions is missing, and the influence of model type and problem difficulty on performance remains unclear. To address these gaps, we conduct the first large-scale study of TTS, spanning over thirty billion tokens generated using eight open-source LLMs (7B to 235B parameters), across four reasoning datasets. We observe three consistent trends: (1) no single TTS strategy universally dominates; (2) reasoning models exhibit distinct trace-quality patterns across problem difficulty and trace length, forming short-horizon and long-horizon categories; and (3) for a given model type, the optimal TTS performance scales monotonically with compute budget. Based on these insights, we provide a practical recipe for selecting the best TTS strategy, considering problem difficulty, model type, and compute budget, providing a practical guide to effective inference-time scaling.

### [250] [Four Over Six: More Accurate NVFP4 Quantization with Adaptive Block Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02010)
*Jack Cook,Junxian Guo,Guangxuan Xiao,Yujun Lin,Song Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Four Over Six (4/6)方法，通过为NVFP4分块选择两种量化尺度因子，减少训练发散并提升大模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统NVFP4量化需对权重、激活值和梯度统一压缩，易导致训练发散及推理性能下降。现有方法依赖多尺度因子评估，但未解决近最大值的量化误差问题。

Method: 在NVFP4框架内，针对每个分块仅计算两种候选尺度因子，优先降低近最大值的量化误差。通过动态选择最优尺度因子实现数值分布均匀化，且兼容NVIDIA Blackwell GPU架构。

Result: 在预训练实验中，4/6显著降低训练损失至接近BF16水平，防止模型发散；在后训练量化场景中，平均下游任务准确率提升，且适配多种模型架构。

Conclusion: 4/6方案优化了FP4格式的动态范围适应性，在不增加硬件成本的前提下提升训练稳定性，为低精度训练与部署提供有效路径。

Abstract: As large language models have grown larger, low-precision numerical formats such as NVFP4 have become increasingly popular due to the speed and memory benefits they provide. However, to accelerate computation with NVFP4, all matrix multiplication operands--weights and activations in the forward pass, and weights, activations, and gradients in the backward pass--must be quantized to NVFP4, often leading to divergence during training and performance degradation during inference. NVFP4 by evaluating multiple potential scale factors for each block of values. To address this issue, in this work we introduce Four Over Six (4/6), a modification to the NVFP4 quantization algorithm that evaluates two potential scale factors for each block of values. Unlike integer formats, floating-point formats such as FP4 have the most quantization error on near-maximal values in each block, which we find to be primarily responsible for downstream performance degradation. We find that for some blocks, scaling to smaller FP4 values makes the distribution of representable values more uniform, improving representation of near-maximal values. Importantly, 4/6 can be implemented efficiently on NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs, making it viable to use while training LLMs with NVFP4. In pre-training experiments with transformer and hybrid model architectures, we find that 4/6 prevents divergence in several cases, bringing training loss significantly closer to BF16 compared to models trained with current state-of-the-art NVFP4 training recipes. We also find that 4/6 can be easily incorporated into many different post-training quantization methods and generally improves downstream accuracy. We hope this inspires future work in training and deploying models with NVFP4.
