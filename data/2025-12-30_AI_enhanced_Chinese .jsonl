Practitioners often exploit the empirical heuristic that early timesteps mainly shape motion and layout while later ones refine appearance, but this behavior has not been systematically characterized. In this work, we proxy motion encoding in video diffusion timesteps by the trade-off between appearance editing and motion preservation induced when injecting new conditions over specified timestep ranges, and characterize this proxy through a large-scale quantitative study. This protocol allows us to factor motion from appearance by quantitatively mapping how they compete along the denoising trajectory. Across diverse architectures, we consistently identify an early, motion-dominant regime and a later, appearance-dominant regime, yielding an operational motion-appearance boundary in timestep space. Building on this characterization, we simplify current one-shot motion customization paradigm by restricting training and inference to the motion-dominant regime, achieving strong motion transfer without auxiliary debiasing modules or specialized objectives. Our analysis turns a widely used heuristic into a spatiotemporal disentanglement principle, and our timestep-constrained recipe can serve as ready integration into existing motion transfer and editing methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5316\u6761\u4ef6\u6ce8\u5165\u5bf9\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8-\u5916\u89c2\u89e3\u8026\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u7b80\u5316\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b9a\u5236\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e8\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u89e3\u6790\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u5982\u4f55\u7f16\u7801\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u5916\u89c2\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65e9\u671f\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u4e3b\u5bfc\u8fd0\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u8be5\u7279\u6027\u7b80\u5316\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b9a\u5236\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6761\u4ef6\u6ce8\u5165\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6307\u5b9a\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u6ce8\u5165\u65b0\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u5206\u6790\u8fd0\u52a8\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u5916\u89c2\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8-\u5916\u89c2\u89e3\u8026\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u65e9\u671f\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u4e3a\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e3b\u5bfc\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u540e\u671f\u4e3a\u5916\u89c2\u4e3b\u5bfc\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u5747\u5b58\u5728\u53ef\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8-\u5916\u89c2\u5206\u754c\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u5f00\u53d1\u65e0\u9700\u53bb\u504f\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u8fd0\u52a8\u8fc1\u79fb\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u5212\u5206\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u65f6\u7a7a\u89e3\u8026\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u53ef\u5728\u73b0\u6709\u8fd0\u52a8\u7f16\u8f91\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u7ea6\u675f\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5316\u6620\u5c04\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e0e\u5916\u89c2\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u5173\u7cfb\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u3002"}}

We introduce SAMM2D, a dual-encoder framework that achieves an AUC of 0.686 on the RSNA intracranial aneurysm dataset; an improvement of 32% over the clinical baseline. In a comprehensive ablation across six augmentation regimes, we made a striking discovery: any form of data augmentation degraded performance when coupled with a strong pretrained backbone. Our unaugmented baseline model outperformed all augmented variants by 1.75--2.23 percentage points (p < 0.01), overturning the assumption that \"more augmentation is always better\" in low-data medical settings. We hypothesize that ImageNet-pretrained features already capture robust invariances, rendering additional augmentations both redundant and disruptive to the learned feature manifold.

In this work, we investigate whether sentence embeddings encode a graded, hierarchical structure aligned with human-interpretable cognitive or psychological attributes. We construct a dataset of 480 natural-language sentences annotated with continuous ordinal energy scores and discrete tier labels spanning seven ordered cognitive categories. Using fixed sentence embeddings from multiple transformer models, we evaluate the recoverability of these annotations via linear and shallow nonlinear probes. Across models, both continuous scores and tier labels are reliably decodable, with shallow nonlinear probes providing consistent performance gains over linear probes. Lexical TF-IDF baselines perform substantially worse, indicating that the observed structure is not attributable to surface word statistics alone. Nonparametric permutation tests further confirm that probe performance exceeds chance under label-randomization nulls. Qualitative analyses using UMAP visualizations and confusion matrices reveal smooth low-to-high gradients and predominantly adjacent-tier confusions in embedding space.

However, traditional MIL approaches often lose crucial contextual information, while transformer-based variants, though more expressive, suffer from quadratic complexity and redundant computations. To address these limitations, we propose HookMIL, a context-aware and computationally efficient MIL framework that leverages compact, learnable hook tokens for structured contextual aggregation. These tokens can be initialized from (i) key-patch visual features, (ii) text embeddings from vision-language pathology models, and (iii) spatially grounded features from spatial transcriptomics-vision models. This multimodal initialization enables Hook Tokens to incorporate rich textual and spatial priors, accelerating convergence and enhancing representation quality. During training, Hook tokens interact with instances through bidirectional attention with linear complexity. To further promote specialization, we introduce a Hook Diversity Loss that encourages each token to focus on distinct histopathological patterns. Additionally, a hook-to-hook communication mechanism refines contextual interactions while minimizing redundancy. Extensive experiments on four public pathology datasets demonstrate that HookMIL achieves state-of-the-art performance, with improved computational efficiency and interpretability.

Existing task verification is treated as a passive, post-hoc process: a verifier (i.e., rule-based scoring script, reward or critic model, and LLM-as-a-Judge) analyzes the agent's entire interaction trajectory to determine if the agent succeeds. Such processing of verbose context that contains irrelevant, noisy history poses challenges to the verification protocols and therefore leads to prohibitive cost and low reliability. To overcome this bottleneck, we propose SmartSnap, a paradigm shift from this passive, post-hoc verification to proactive, in-situ self-verification by the agent itself. We introduce the Self-Verifying Agent, a new type of agent designed with dual missions: to not only complete a task but also to prove its accomplishment with curated snapshot evidences. Guided by our proposed 3C Principles (Completeness, Conciseness, and Creativity), the agent leverages its accessibility to the online environment to perform self-verification on a minimal, decisive set of snapshots. Such evidences are provided as the sole materials for a general LLM-as-a-Judge verifier to determine their validity and relevance. Experiments on mobile tasks across model families and scales demonstrate that our SmartSnap paradigm allows training LLM-driven agents in a scalable manner, bringing performance gains up to 26.08% and 16.66% respectively to 8B and 30B models.

We first replicate TinySAM on COCO val2017 using official checkpoints, matching the reported AP within 0.03%, establishing a reliable experimental baseline. Building on this, we propose Tiny-YOLOSAM, a fast hybrid pipeline that uses a recent YOLO detector (YOLOv12) to generate box prompts for TinySAM on salient foreground objects, and supplements uncovered regions with sparse point prompts sampled only where YOLO-guided masks provide no coverage. On COCO val2017, the hybrid system substantially improves class-agnostic coverage (AR from 16.4% to 77.1%, mIoU from 19.2% to 67.8%) while reducing end-to-end runtime from 49.20s/image to 10.39s/image (4.7x) on an Apple M1 Pro CPU.

Limited access to physicians often leaves DR undiagnosed. To address this, AI models utilize lesion segmentation for interpretability; however, manually annotating lesions is impractical for clinicians. Physicians require a model that explains the reasoning for classifications rather than just highlighting lesion locations. Furthermore, current models are one-dimensional, relying on a single imaging modality for explainability and achieving limited effectiveness. In contrast, a quantitative-detection system that identifies individual DR lesions in natural language would overcome these limitations, enabling diverse applications in screening, treatment, and research settings. To address this issue, this paper presents a novel multimodal explainability model utilizing a VLM with few-shot learning, which mimics an ophthalmologist's reasoning by analyzing lesion distributions within retinal quadrants for fundus images. The model generates paired Grad-CAM heatmaps, showcasing individual neuron weights across both OCT and fundus images, which visually highlight the regions contributing to DR severity classification.

To address these challenges, this paper proposes the TCFormer, a tiny, ultra-lightweight, weakly-supervised transformer-based crowd counting framework with only 5 million parameters that achieves competitive performance. Firstly, a powerful yet efficient vision transformer is adopted as the feature extractor, the global context-aware capabilities of which provides semantic meaningful crowd features with a minimal memory footprint. Secondly, to compensate for the lack of spatial supervision, we design a feature aggregation mechanism termed the Learnable Density-Weighted Averaging module. This module dynamically re-weights local tokens according to predicted density scores, enabling the network to adaptively modulate regional features based on their specific density characteristics without the need for additional annotations. Furthermore, this paper introduces a density-level classification loss, which discretizes crowd density into distinct grades, thereby regularizing the training process and enhancing the model's classification power across varying levels of crowd density. Therefore, although TCformer is trained under a weakly-supervised paradigm utilizing only image-level global counts, the joint optimization of count and density-level losses enables the framework to achieve high estimation accuracy. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks including ShanghaiTech A/B, UCF-QNRF, and NWPU datasets demonstrate that our approach strikes a superior trade-off between parameter efficiency and counting accuracy and can be a good solution for crowd counting tasks in edge devices.", "AI": {"tldr": "TCFormer \u901a\u8fc7 5M \u53c2\u6570\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5f31\u76d1\u7763 Transformer \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4eba\u7fa4\u8ba1\u6570\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u5927\uff0c\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u96be\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u9700\u5f00\u53d1\u53c2\u6570\u5c11\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u5bc6\u96c6\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848", "method": "1) \u4f7f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf Vision Transformer \u63d0\u53d6\u5168\u5c40\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\n2) \u8bbe\u8ba1\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u5bc6\u5ea6\u52a0\u6743\u6a21\u5757\uff08LDWAm\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u533a\u57df\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u66ff\u4ee3\u7a7a\u95f4\u76d1\u7763\uff1b\n3) \u5f15\u5165\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7b49\u7ea7\u5206\u7c7b\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728ShanghaiTech\u7b494\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b9e\u73b0\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u5728\u4ec5\u56fe\u50cf\u7ea7\u6807\u7b7e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0b\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u7ea7\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u4f53\u79ef\u7f29\u51cf80%+\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301<1%\u7cbe\u5ea6\u635f\u5931", "conclusion": "\u8bc1\u660e\u5f31\u76d1\u7763Transformer\u53ef\u7a81\u7834\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4eba\u7fa4\u8ba1\u6570\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

Our method incorporates semantic reasoning via an LLM-generated knowledge prior that captures feature importance, inter-class confusability, and exemplar budget multipliers, and uses it to guide exemplar scoring and selection. These priors are combined with margin-based validation cues, PageRank centrality, hubness penalization, and facility-location optimization to obtain a compact and informative set of exemplars. Evaluated on the UCI-HAR dataset under strict few-shot conditions, the framework achieves a macro F1-score of 88.78%, outperforming classical approaches such as random sampling, herding, and $k$-center. The results show that LLM-derived semantic priors, when integrated with structural and geometric cues, provide a stronger foundation for selecting representative sensor exemplars in few-shot wearable-sensor HAR.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLM-Guided Exemplar Selection\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6d3b\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u5408\u5b9e\u73b0few-shot\u573a\u666f\u4e0b88.78% F1-score\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709HAR\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u4e14\u91c7\u7528\u7eaf\u51e0\u4f55\u9009\u6837\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u76f8\u4f3c\u6d3b\u52a8\uff08\u5982\u884c\u8d70\u3001\u4e0a\u697c\u3001\u4e0b\u697c\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528LLM\u751f\u6210\u77e5\u8bc6\u5148\u9a8c\uff08\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u8981\u6027/\u7c7b\u95f4\u6df7\u6dc6/\u6837\u672c\u6743\u91cd\uff09\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u8fb9\u7f18\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3001PageRank\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6027\u3001hub\u60e9\u7f5a\u548c\u8bbe\u65bd\u9009\u5740\u4f18\u5316\u8fdb\u884c\u6837\u672c\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "result": "\u5728UCI-HAR\u4e25\u683cfew-shot\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8fbe\u523088.78% macro F1-score\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u968f\u673a\u91c7\u6837\u3001herding\u3001k\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7b49\u7ecf\u5178\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u8bed\u4e49\u5148\u9a8c\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6d3b\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Existing evaluation methods, such as KnowHalu, employ multi-stage verification but suffer from high computational costs. To address this, we integrate the Hughes Hallucination Evaluation Model (HHEM), a lightweight classification-based framework that operates independently of LLM-based judgments, significantly improving efficiency while maintaining high detection accuracy. We conduct a comparative analysis of hallucination detection methods across various LLMs, evaluating True Positive Rate (TPR), True Negative Rate (TNR), and Accuracy on question-answering (QA) and summarization tasks. Our results show that HHEM reduces evaluation time from 8 hours to 10 minutes, while HHEM with non-fabrication checking achieves the highest accuracy \\(82.2\\%\\) and TPR \\(78.9\\%\\). However, HHEM struggles with localized hallucinations in summarization tasks. To address this, we introduce segment-based retrieval, improving detection by verifying smaller text components. Additionally, our cumulative distribution function (CDF) analysis indicates that larger models (7B-9B parameters) generally exhibit fewer hallucinations, while intermediate-sized models show higher instability.

This study introduces the concept of vertical-domain accounting reasoning and establishes evaluation criteria by analyzing the training data characteristics of representative GLM-series models. These criteria provide a foundation for subsequent research on reasoning paradigms and offer benchmarks for improving accounting reasoning performance. Based on this framework, we evaluate several representative models, including GLM-6B, GLM-130B, GLM-4, and OpenAI GPT-4, on a set of accounting reasoning tasks. Experimental results show that different prompt engineering strategies lead to varying degrees of performance improvement across models, with GPT-4 achieving the strongest accounting reasoning capability.

Existing static strategies, such as sparse sampling, frame compression, and clustering, are optimized for offline settings and often produce fragmented or over-compressed outputs when applied to continuous video streams. We present VideoScaffold, a dynamic representation framework designed for streaming video understanding. It adaptively adjusts event granularity according to video duration while preserving fine-grained visual semantics. VideoScaffold introduces two key components: Elastic-Scale Event Segmentation (EES), which performs prediction-guided segmentation to dynamically refine event boundaries, and Hierarchical Event Consolidation (HEC), which progressively aggregates semantically related segments into multi-level abstractions. Working in concert, EES and HEC enable VideoScaffold to transition smoothly from fine-grained frame understanding to abstract event reasoning as the video stream unfolds.

Similarly, we demonstrate that Large Language Models (LLMs) can learn to dynamically determine when to attend to global context.

Our results indicate that with a window size of 256 tokens, up to 93\\% of the original full attention operations can be replaced by sliding window attention without performance loss. Furthermore, by evaluating AHA across various window sizes, we identify a long-tail distribution in context dependency, where the necessity for full attention decays rapidly as the local window expands.

However, their performance is frequently constrained by the overly simplistic front-end designs employed in models like ViTPose. This naive patchification mechanism struggles to effectively handle multi-scale variations and results in irreversible information loss during the initial feature extraction phase. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel KAN-enhanced FPN-Stem architecture. Through rigorous ablation studies, we first identified that the true bottleneck for performance improvement lies not in plug-and-play attention modules (e.g., CBAM), but in the post-fusion non-linear smoothing step within the FPN. Guided by this insight, our core innovation is to retain the classic \"upsample-and-add\" fusion stream of the FPN, but replace its terminal, standard linear 3x3 smoothing convolution with a powerful KAN-based convolutional layer. Leveraging its superior non-linear modeling capabilities, this KAN-based layer adaptively learns and rectifies the \"artifacts\" generated during the multi-scale fusion process. Extensive experiments on the COCO dataset demonstrate that our KAN-FPN-Stem achieves a significant performance boost of up to +2.0 AP over the lightweight ViTPose-S baseline. This work not only delivers a plug-and-play, high-performance module but, more importantly, reveals that: the performance bottleneck in ViT front-end often lies not in 'feature refinement' (Attention), but in the quality of 'feature fusion' (Fusion). Furthermore, it provides an effective path to address this bottleneck through the introduction of the KAN operator.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aKAN-FPN-Stem\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06FPN\u4e2d\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u5e73\u6ed1\u5377\u79ef\u66ff\u6362\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8eKAN\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5c42\uff0c\u5728\u89c6\u89c9Transformer\uff08ViT\uff09\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u9636\u6bb5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8aViTPose-S\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b2.0 AP\u3002", "motivation": "ViT\u7684\u524d\u7aef\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff08\u5982ViTPose\u4e2d\u7684\u7b80\u5355patchification\u673a\u5236\uff09\u56e0\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u5bfc\u81f4\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\uff0c\u4e14\u4f20\u7edf\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u5982CBAM\uff09\u5e76\u975e\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u74f6\u9888\u5728\u4e8eFPN\u7684\u540e\u878d\u5408\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5e73\u6ed1\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u4fdd\u7559FPN\u7684\u7ecf\u5178'\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837\u76f8\u52a0'\u878d\u5408\u6d41\uff0c\u4f46\u5c06\u5176\u7ec8\u7aef\u76843\u00d73\u7ebf\u6027\u5377\u79ef\u66ff\u6362\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8eKAN\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5377\u79ef\u5c42\uff0c\u5229\u7528KAN\u7684\u5f3a\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4fee\u6b63\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u878d\u5408\u4e2d\u7684\u4f2a\u5f71\u3002", "result": "\u5728COCO\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cKAN-FPN-Stem\u76f8\u8f83ViTPose-S\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u5347+2.0 AP\u3002\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u74f6\u9888\u5728\u4e8e\u878d\u5408\u8d28\u91cf\u800c\u975e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86KAN\u5c42\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ViT\u524d\u7aef\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\u672c\u8d28\u5728\u4e8e\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\uff08Fusion\uff09\u800c\u975e\u7279\u5f81\u7cbe\u70bc\uff08Attention\uff09\uff0cKAN\u7b97\u5b50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u6761\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u5f3a\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u89e3\u51b3\u8be5\u74f6\u9888\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Existing methods often neglect both projection-domain physics knowledge and patient-specific meta-information, which are critical for functional-semantic correlation mining. In this study, we introduce a meta-information guided cross-domain synergistic diffusion model (MiG-DM) that integrates comprehensive cross-modal priors to generate high-quality PET images. Specifically, a meta-information encoding module transforms clinical parameters into semantic prompts by considering patient characteristics, dose-related information, and semi-quantitative parameters, enabling cross-modal alignment between textual meta-information and image reconstruction.

However, existing LLM-based approaches largely adopt general natural language processing techniques and are prone to reasoning errors when handling complex numerical sequences. Different from purely textual tasks, time series data are inherently verifiable, enabling consistency checking between reasoning steps and the original input. Motivated by this property, we propose T3LLM, which performs multi-step reasoning with an explicit correction mechanism for time series question answering. The T3LLM framework consists of three LLMs, namely, a worker, a reviewer, and a student, that are responsible for generation, review, and reasoning learning, respectively. Within this framework, the worker generates step-wise chains of thought (CoT) under structured prompts, while the reviewer inspects the reasoning, identifies erroneous steps, and provides corrective comments. The collaboratively generated corrected CoT are used to fine-tune the student model, internalizing multi-step reasoning and self-correction into its parameters.

Experiments are conducted on a rice seed variety identification dataset containing nine varieties and further extended to four plant leaf disease datasets, including rice, potato, coffee, and corn, to evaluate generalization capability. On the rice seed variety classification task, the distilled student model achieves an accuracy of 98.56%, which is only 0.09% lower than the teacher model (98.65%), while requiring only 0.68 GFLOPs and approximately 1.07 million parameters. This corresponds to a reduction of about 2.7 times in computational cost and more than 10 times in model size compared with the ResNet18 teacher model. In addition, compared with representative pretrained models, the proposed student reduces the number of parameters by more than 6 times relative to DenseNet121 and by over 80 times compared with the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture, while maintaining comparable or superior classification accuracy.

Through analyses of recent large diffusion language models, we identify two central issues: (i) uniform corruption does not respect how information is distributed across positions, and (ii) token-wise marginal training cannot capture multi-token dependencies during parallel decoding. These observations motivate diffusion processes that align more closely with the structure of text, and encourage future work toward more coherent diffusion language models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u8fde\u7eed\u6269\u6563\uff08\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\uff09\u548c\u79bb\u6563\u6269\u6563\uff08token\u7ea7\uff09\u5404\u81ea\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4fe1\u606f\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u591atoken\u4f9d\u8d56\u662f\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u79bb\u6563\u6027\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u6269\u6563\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u539f\u7406\u7684\u51b2\u7a81\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u672a\u80fd\u5b8c\u6574\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e94\u5927\u5fc5\u8981\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u5398\u6e05\u6838\u5fc3\u77db\u76fe\u4ee5\u63a8\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u6784\u6269\u6563\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e94\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u7c7b\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u5bf9\u7167\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u7ed3\u5408\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u53d6\u4e24\u5927\u6838\u5fc3\u7f3a\u9677\uff1a\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4fe1\u606f\u8150\u8680\u5931\u8861\u4e0e\u591atoken\u4f9d\u8d56\u7f3a\u5931\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u8fde\u7eed\u6269\u6563\u867d\u5177\u5e76\u884c\u4f18\u52bf\u4f46\u635f\u5931\u5e8f\u5217\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u79bb\u6563\u6269\u6563\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\uff1b\u5747\u5300\u4fe1\u606f\u8150\u8680\u5bfc\u81f4\u91cd\u8981\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5931\u771f\uff0c\u9010token\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u83b7\u8de8\u8bcd\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u59a5\u534f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u975e\u5747\u5300\u8150\u8680\u4e0e\u591atoken\u534f\u540c\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e3a\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u6784\u5efa\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u5c42\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6269\u6563\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u6a21\u3002"}}

Such discrepancies undermine the reliability of CoT-based methods for safety supervision and alignment monitoring, as models can generate plausible but deceptive rationales for incorrect answers. To better understand this limitation, we evaluate two optimization methods, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), in their ability to improve CoT faithfulness. Our experiments show that GRPO achieves higher performance than DPO in larger models, with the Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct model attaining the best results across all evaluation metrics.

Current benchmarks, typically based on medical licensing exams or curated vignettes, fail to capture the integrated, multimodal reasoning essential for real-world patient care. Methods: We developed the Bones and Joints (B&J) Benchmark, a comprehensive evaluation framework comprising 1,245 questions derived from real-world patient cases in orthopedics and sports medicine. This benchmark assesses models across 7 tasks that mirror the clinical reasoning pathway, including knowledge recall, text and image interpretation, diagnosis generation, treatment planning, and rationale provision. We evaluated eleven vision-language models (VLMs) and six large language models (LLMs), comparing their performance against expert-derived ground truth. Results: Our results demonstrate a pronounced performance gap between task types. While state-of-the-art models achieved high accuracy, exceeding 90%, on structured multiple-choice questions, their performance markedly declined on open-ended tasks requiring multimodal integration, with accuracy scarcely reaching 60%. VLMs demonstrated substantial limitations in interpreting medical images and frequently exhibited severe text-driven hallucinations, often ignoring contradictory visual evidence. Notably, models specifically fine-tuned for medical applications showed no consistent advantage over general-purpose counterparts.

We present a systematic study of Adaptive Prediction Sets (APS) applied to next-token prediction in transformer-based models with large vocabularies (greater than 250,000 tokens). Our central contribution is the identification of a coverage-efficiency tradeoff: while naive conformal prediction achieves valid coverage, it produces prediction sets of hundreds of tokens, rendering them uninformative. We propose Vocabulary-Aware Conformal Prediction (VACP), a framework that leverages semantic masking and temperature-adjusted scoring to reduce the effective prediction space while provably maintaining marginal coverage. Experiments on Gemma-2B using SQUAD and WikiText benchmarks demonstrate that VACP achieves 89.7 percent empirical coverage (90 percent target) while reducing the mean prediction set size from 847 tokens to 4.3 tokens -- a 197x improvement in efficiency.

Deep learning has the potential to enhance sonographers' efficiency and support the training of new practitioners. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are particularly promising for ultrasound interpretation, as they can jointly process images and text to perform multiple clinical tasks within a single framework. However, despite the expansion of VLMs, no standardized benchmark exists to evaluate their performance in fetal ultrasound imaging. This gap is primarily due to the modality's challenging nature, operator dependency, and the limited public availability of datasets. To address this gap, we present Fetal-Gauge, the first and largest visual question answering benchmark specifically designed to evaluate VLMs across various fetal ultrasound tasks. Our benchmark comprises over 42,000 images and 93,000 question-answer pairs, spanning anatomical plane identification, visual grounding of anatomical structures, fetal orientation assessment, clinical view conformity, and clinical diagnosis. We systematically evaluate several state-of-the-art VLMs, including general-purpose and medical-specific models, and reveal a substantial performance gap: the best-performing model achieves only 55\\% accuracy, far below clinical requirements. Our analysis identifies critical limitations of current VLMs in fetal ultrasound interpretation, highlighting the urgent need for domain-adapted architectures and specialized training approaches. Fetal-Gauge establishes a rigorous foundation for advancing multimodal deep learning in prenatal care and provides a pathway toward addressing global healthcare accessibility challenges.

Current studies are largely focused on English, which has resulted in a lack of resources for low-resource languages such as Urdu. As a result, the creation of tools that facilitate positive online communication remains limited. Although transformer-based architectures have proven to be effective in detecting hate and offensive speech, little has been done to apply them to hope speech or, more generally, to test them across a variety of linguistic settings. This paper presents a multilingual framework for hope speech detection with a focus on Urdu. Using pretrained transformer models such as XLM-RoBERTa, mBERT, EuroBERT, and UrduBERT, we apply simple preprocessing and train classifiers for improved results. Evaluations on the PolyHope-M 2025 benchmark demonstrate strong performance, achieving F1-scores of 95.2% for Urdu binary classification and 65.2% for Urdu multi-class classification, with similarly competitive results in Spanish, German, and English.

We introduce a human-validated framework to evaluate whether model-generated reasoning traces logically support their conclusions across languages. Analyzing 65k reasoning traces from GlobalMMLU questions across 6 languages and 6 frontier models, we uncover a critical blind spot: while models achieve high task accuracy, their reasoning can fail to support their conclusions.

Despite ongoing efforts to understand the causes of negative pregnancy outcomes like miscarriage, stillbirths, birth defects, and premature birth, there is still a need for more comprehensive research and strategies for intervention. This paper introduces a novel approach that uses publicly available social media data, especially from platforms like Twitter, to enhance current datasets for studying negative pregnancy outcomes through observational research. The inherent challenges in utilizing social media data, including imbalance, noise, and lack of structure, necessitate robust preprocessing techniques and data augmentation strategies. By constructing a natural language processing (NLP) pipeline, we aim to automatically identify women sharing their pregnancy experiences, categorizing them based on reported outcomes. Women reporting full gestation and normal birth weight will be classified as positive cases, while those reporting negative pregnancy outcomes will be identified as negative cases. Furthermore, this study offers potential applications in assessing the causal impact of specific interventions, treatments, or prenatal exposures on maternal and fetal health outcomes. Additionally, it provides a framework for future health studies involving pregnant cohorts and comparator groups.

Diffusion Language Models (DLLMs) offer parallel decoding by recovering multiple masked tokens per step; however, in practice they often fail to translate this parallelism into deployment speed gains over optimized AR engines (e.g., vLLM). A key reason is that many DLLMs rely on bidirectional attention, which breaks standard prefix KV caching and forces repeated contextualization, undermining efficiency. We propose WeDLM, a diffusion decoding framework built entirely on standard causal attention to make parallel generation prefix-cache friendly. The core idea is to let each masked position condition on all currently observed tokens while keeping a strict causal mask, achieved by Topological Reordering that moves observed tokens to the physical prefix while preserving their logical positions. Building on this property, we introduce a streaming decoding procedure that continuously commits confident tokens into a growing left-to-right prefix and maintains a fixed parallel workload, avoiding the stop-and-wait behavior common in block diffusion methods. Experiments show that WeDLM preserves the quality of strong AR backbones while delivering substantial speedups, approaching 3x on challenging reasoning benchmarks and up to 10x in low-entropy generation regimes; critically, our comparisons are against AR baselines served by vLLM under matched deployment settings, demonstrating that diffusion-style decoding can outperform an optimized AR engine in practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "WeDLM\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\uff08AR\uff09\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u62d3\u6251\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u548c\u6d41\u5f0f\u89e3\u7801\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e76\u884c\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u53cc\u5411\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8avLLM\u4f18\u5316\u7684AR\u6a21\u578b\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08DLMs\uff09\u4f9d\u8d56\u53cc\u5411\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u524d\u7f00KV\u7f13\u5b58\u673a\u5236\u5931\u6548\u5e76\u589e\u52a0\u91cd\u590d\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f18\u5316\u7684AR\u5f15\u64ce\uff08\u5982vLLM\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faWeDLM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u56e0\u679c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u62d3\u6251\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u5c06\u5df2\u89c2\u6d4btoken\u7269\u7406\u524d\u7f00\u5316\u4f46\u4fdd\u7559\u903b\u8f91\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6d41\u5f0f\u89e3\u7801\uff1a\u6301\u7eed\u5c06\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6token\u63d0\u4ea4\u5230\u5de6\u5230\u53f3\u524d\u7f00\uff0c\u56fa\u5b9a\u5e76\u884c\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u5757\u6269\u6563\u7684\u505c\u7b49\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4fdd\u6301AR\u6a21\u578b\u8d28\u91cf\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u63a5\u8fd13\u500d\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u4f4e\u71b5\u751f\u6210\u573a\u666f\u6700\u9ad810\u500d\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u6bd4\u57fa\u4e8evLLM\u7684AR\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7eaf\u56e0\u679c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e0e\u6d41\u5f0f\u89e3\u7801\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u6269\u6563\u8303\u5f0f\u89e3\u7801\u53ef\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u540e\u7684AR\u5f15\u64ce\uff0c\u5f25\u5408\u7406\u8bba\u5e76\u884c\u6027\u4e0e\u5de5\u7a0b\u6548\u7387\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002"}}

Consequently, prevailing approaches tend to rely on uniform frame sampling or static pre-selection, which might overlook critical evidence and unable to correct its initial selection error during its reasoning process. To overcome these limitations, we propose VideoZoomer, a novel agentic framework that enables MLLMs to dynamically control their visual focus during reasoning. Starting from a coarse low-frame-rate overview, VideoZoomer invokes a temporal zoom tool to obtain high-frame-rate clips at autonomously chosen moments, thereby progressively gathering fine-grained evidence in a multi-turn interactive manner. Accordingly, we adopt a two-stage training strategy: a cold-start supervised fine-tuning phase on a curated dataset of distilled exemplar and reflection trajectories, followed by reinforcement learning to further refine the agentic policy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our 7B model delivers diverse and complex reasoning patterns, yielding strong performance across a broad set of long video understanding and reasoning benchmarks.

However, low-resource languages such as Urdu have received limited attention in this domain. An obvious approach is to utilize a multilingual pretrained language model and fine-tune it for a downstream classification task, such as misinformation detection. However, these models struggle with domain-specific terms, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we investigate the effectiveness of domain adaptation before fine-tuning for fake news classification in Urdu, employing a staged training approach to optimize model generalization. We evaluate two widely used multilingual models, XLM-RoBERTa and mBERT, and apply domain-adaptive pretraining using a publicly available Urdu news corpus.

This energy formulation directly captures the composed distribution of multiple motion concepts, enabling the model to discover them without relying on ground-truth motions for individual concepts. Within this paradigm, we introduce three training variants to encourage a decompositional understanding of motion: 1. DeMoGen-Exp explicitly trains on decomposed text prompts; 2. DeMoGen-OSS performs orthogonal self-supervised decomposition; 3. DeMoGen-SC enforces semantic consistency between original and decomposed text embeddings. These variants enable our approach to disentangle reusable motion primitives from complex motion sequences. We also demonstrate that the decomposed motion concepts can be flexibly recombined to generate diverse and novel motions, generalizing beyond the training distribution. Additionally, we construct a text-decomposed dataset to support compositional training, serving as an extended resource to facilitate text-to-motion generation and motion composition.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faDeMoGen\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u80fd\u91cf\u57fa\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u4f5c\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u5b50\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u5206\u89e3\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u652f\u6301\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u52a8\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u6b63\u5411\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u5206\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u9006\u5411\u5206\u89e3\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u53d1\u73b0\u53ef\u590d\u7528\u4e14\u8bed\u4e49\u660e\u786e\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u57fa\u5143\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u80fd\u91cf\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u79cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\uff1a\u663e\u5f0f\u5206\u89e3\u6587\u672c\u8bad\u7ec3(DeMoGen-Exp)\u3001\u6b63\u4ea4\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5206\u89e3(DeMoGen-OSS)\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7ea6\u675f(DeMoGen-SC)\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u9006\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u52a8\u4f5c\u5206\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u4ece\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u4f5c\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u89e3\u8026\u51fa\u53ef\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u57fa\u5143\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u5355\u6982\u5ff5\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u52a8\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4e14\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u8fdb\u884c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u7ec4\u5408\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u52a8\u4f5c\u7406\u89e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u5206\u89e3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\u9a71\u52a8\u52a8\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u548c\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u3002"}}

However, moving such cancer cases forward for treatment requires accurate on the amount of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) protein expression. Predicting both the lower and higher levels of HER2 can be challenging. Moreover, jointly analyzing H&E and immunohistochemistry (IHC) stained images for HER2 scoring is difficult. Although several deep learning methods have been investigated to address the challenge of HER2 scoring, they suffer from providing a pixel-level localization of HER2 status. In this study, we propose a single end-to-end pipeline using a system of vision transformers with HER2 status scoring on whole slide images of WSIs. The method includes patch-wise processing of H&E WSIs for tumor localization. A novel mapping function is proposed to correspondingly identify correlated IHC WSIs regions with malignant regions on H&E. A clinically inspired HER2 scoring mechanism is embedded in the pipeline and allows for automatic pixel-level annotation of 4-way HER2 scoring (0, 1+, 2+, and 3+). Also, the proposed method accurately returns HER2-negative and HER2-positive. Privately curated datasets were collaboratively extracted from 13 different cases of WSIs of H&E and IHC. A thorough experiment is conducted on the proposed method. Results obtained showed a good classification accuracy during tumor localization. Also, a classification accuracy of 0.94 and a specificity of 0.933 were returned for the prediction of HER2 status, scoring in the 4-way methods.

In this study, we evaluated the performance of three state-of-the-art LLMs-ChatGPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and LIama 3.3 70B-in clinical decision support across the entire clinical reasoning workflow of a typical patient encounter. Using 36 case studies, we first assessed LLM's out-of-the-box performance across five key sequential clinical decision-making tasks under two temperature settings (default vs. zero): differential diagnosis, essential immediate steps, relevant diagnostic testing, final diagnosis, and treatment recommendation. All models showed high variability by task, achieving near-perfect accuracy in final diagnosis, poor performance in relevant diagnostic testing, and moderate performance in remaining tasks. Furthermore, ChatGPT performed better under the zero temperature, whereas LIama showed stronger performance under the default temperature. Next, we assessed whether prompt engineering could enhance LLM performance by applying variations of the MedPrompt framework, incorporating targeted and random dynamic few-shot learning. The results demonstrate that prompt engineering is not a one-size-fit-all solution. While it significantly improved the performance on the task with lowest baseline accuracy (relevant diagnostic testing), it was counterproductive for others. Another key finding was that the targeted dynamic few-shot prompting did not consistently outperform random selection, indicating that the presumed benefits of closely matched examples may be counterbalanced by loss of broader contextual diversity. These findings suggest that the impact of prompt engineering is highly model and task-dependent, highlighting the need for tailored, context-aware strategies for integrating LLMs into healthcare.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08ChatGPT-4o\u3001Gemini 1.5 Pro\u3001Llama 3.3 70B\uff09\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u56e0\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u8bbe\u7f6e\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4e00\u3002", "motivation": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u5176\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u77e5\u8bc6\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc736\u4e2a\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e09\u79cdLLMs\u57285\u9879\u4e34\u5e8a\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u9274\u522b\u8bca\u65ad\u3001\u7d27\u6025\u6b65\u9aa4\u3001\u8bca\u65ad\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3001\u6700\u7ec8\u8bca\u65ad\u3001\u6cbb\u7597\u5efa\u8bae\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u9ed8\u8ba4\u6e29\u5ea6\u4e0e\u96f6\u6e29\u5ea6\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff1b\u5f15\u5165MedPrompt\u6846\u67b6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\uff08\u542b\u9776\u5411\u53ca\u968f\u673a\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\uff09\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "LLMs\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\uff1a\u6700\u7ec8\u8bca\u65ad\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fd1\u4e4e\u5b8c\u7f8e\uff0c\u8bca\u65ad\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\uff0c\u5176\u4f59\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7b49\u6c34\u5e73\uff1bChatGPT\u5728\u96f6\u6e29\u5ea6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f73\uff0cLama\u5728\u9ed8\u8ba4\u6e29\u5ea6\u4e0b\u66f4\u5f3a\u3002\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8bca\u65ad\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6027\u80fd\u4f46\u5bf9\u5176\u4ed6\u4efb\u52a1\u65e0\u6548\uff0c\u4e14\u9776\u5411\u63d0\u793a\u672a\u4f18\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u63d0\u793a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u5bf9LLM\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u6548\u679c\u56e0\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u800c\u5f02\uff0c\u9700\u5f00\u53d1\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u533b\u7597\u573a\u666f\u6574\u5408\u3002"}}

In this paper, we bridge this critical gap by tackling three key challenges in 3D object arrangement task using MLLMs. First, to address the weak visual grounding of MLLMs, which struggle to link programmatic edits with precise 3D outcomes, we introduce an MCP-based API. This shifts the interaction from brittle raw code manipulation to more robust, function-level updates. Second, we augment the MLLM's 3D scene understanding with a suite of specialized visual tools to analyze scene state, gather spatial information, and validate action outcomes. This perceptual feedback loop is critical for closing the gap between language-based updates and precise 3D-aware manipulation. Third, to manage the iterative, error-prone updates, we propose a collaborative multi-agent framework with designated roles for planning, execution, and verification. This decomposition allows the system to robustly handle multi-step instructions and recover from intermediate errors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a diverse set of 25 complex object arrangement tasks, where it significantly outperforms existing baselines.

Post-training structured pruning offers an efficient solution. However, when few-shot calibration sets fail to adequately reflect the pretraining data distribution, existing methods exhibit limited generalization to downstream tasks. To address this issue, we propose Function-Aware Neuron Grouping (FANG), a post-training pruning framework that alleviates calibration bias by identifying and preserving neurons critical to specific function. FANG groups neurons with similar function based on the type of semantic context they process and prunes each group independently. During importance estimation within each group, tokens that strongly correlate with the functional role of the neuron group are given higher weighting. Additionally, FANG also preserves neurons that contribute across multiple context types. To achieve a better trade-off between sparsity and performance, it allocates sparsity to each block adaptively based on its functional complexity. Experiments show that FANG improves downstream accuracy while preserving language modeling performance. It achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) results when combined with FLAP and OBC, two representative pruning methods.

Unlike traditional diffusion or flow models, it does not rely solely on local supervision, which typically necessitates many inference steps. Unlike distillation-based approaches, it does not require a pretrained teacher. This combination of instantaneous local learning and self-driven global matching bridges the gap between the two paradigms, enabling the training of a high-quality text-to-image model from scratch that excels even at very low step counts.

We further find that its performance improves monotonically as inference steps increase, enabling both ultra-fast few-step generation and high-quality long-trajectory sampling within a single unified model.

Current LLMs cannot natively ingest long-duration sensor streams, and paired sensor-text datasets are scarce. To address these challenges, we introduce LENS, a framework that aligns multimodal sensing data with language models to generate clinically grounded mental-health narratives. LENS first constructs a large-scale dataset by transforming Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) responses related to depression and anxiety symptoms into natural-language descriptions, yielding over 100,000 sensor-text QA pairs from 258 participants. To enable native time-series integration, we train a patch-level encoder that projects raw sensor signals directly into an LLM's representation space.

We argue this metric confuses unfaithfulness with incompleteness, the lossy compression needed to turn distributed transformer computation into a linear natural language narrative. On multi-hop reasoning tasks with Llama-3 and Gemma-3, many CoTs flagged as unfaithful by Biasing Features are judged faithful by other metrics, exceeding 50% in some models. With a new faithful@k metric, we show that larger inference-time token budgets greatly increase hint verbalization (up to 90% in some settings), suggesting much apparent unfaithfulness is due to tight token limits. Using Causal Mediation Analysis, we further show that even non-verbalized hints can causally mediate prediction changes through the CoT.

Diffusion models achieve high accuracy by formulating detection as a multi-step stochastic denoising process, but their reliance on numerous sampling steps ($T \\gg 60$) makes them impractical for time-sensitive clinical applications like Crohn's Disease detection in Magnetic Resonance Enterography (MRE). DeFloMat replaces this slow stochastic path with a highly direct, deterministic flow field derived from Conditional Optimal Transport (OT) theory, specifically approximating the Rectified Flow.

Convolutional methods in prior work often struggle to capture long-range dependencies, which can lead to structurally inconsistent or physically unrealizable plans.

The model uses a unified two-stage design: Stage~1 predicts a global dose prior from anatomical inputs, and Stage~2 conditions this prior on explicit beam geometry to regress physically calibrated fluence maps. Central to the approach is the \\textbf{Fluence-Aware Regression (FAR)} loss, a physics-informed objective that integrates voxel-level fidelity, gradient smoothness, structural consistency, and beam-wise energy conservation. We evaluate the generality of the framework across multiple transformer backbones, including Swin UNETR, UNETR, nnFormer, and MedFormer, using a prostate IMRT dataset.

We introduce Controllable Emotional Image Content Generation (C-EICG), which aims to generate images that remain faithful to a given content description while expressing a target emotion. Existing text-to-image models ensure content consistency but lack emotional awareness, whereas emotion-driven models generate affective results at the cost of content distortion. To address this gap, we propose EmoCtrl, supported by a dataset annotated with content, emotion, and affective prompts, bridging abstract emotions to visual cues. EmoCtrl incorporates textual and visual emotion enhancement modules that enrich affective expression via descriptive semantics and perceptual cues. The learned emotion tokens exhibit complementary effects, as demonstrated through ablations and visualizations.

How do large language models (LLMs) perform in generating them? How are LLM-generated summaries different from those written by human experts? However, the lack of a comprehensive, high-quality scientific TLDR dataset hinders both the development and evaluation of LLMs' summarization ability. To address these, we propose a novel dataset, BiomedTLDR, containing a large sample of researcher-authored summaries from scientific papers, which leverages the common practice of including authors' comments alongside bibliography items. We then test popular open-weight LLMs for generating TLDRs based on abstracts. Our analysis reveals that, although some of them successfully produce humanoid summaries, LLMs generally exhibit a greater affinity for the original text's lexical choices and rhetorical structures, hence tend to be more extractive rather than abstractive in general, compared to humans.

By modeling LiDAR scans as beam-aware graphs and incorporating gated residual fusion with feed-forward refinement, SuperiorGAT enables accurate reconstruction without increasing network depth. To evaluate performance, structured beam dropout is simulated by removing every fourth vertical scanning beam. Extensive experiments across diverse KITTI environments, including Person, Road, Campus, and City sequences, demonstrate that SuperiorGAT consistently achieves lower reconstruction error and improved geometric consistency compared to PointNet-based models and deeper GAT baselines.

Current event camera calibration methods typically involve using flashing patterns, reconstructing intensity images, and utilizing the features extracted from events. Existing methods are generally time-consuming and require manually placed calibration objects, which cannot meet the needs of rapidly changing scenarios. In this paper, we propose a line-based event camera calibration framework exploiting the geometric lines of commonly-encountered objects in man-made environments, e.g., doors, windows, boxes, etc. Different from previous methods, our method detects lines directly from event streams and leverages an event-line calibration model to generate the initial guess of camera parameters, which is suitable for both planar and non-planar lines.

We hypothesize that these errors stem from the flexibility of general-purpose languages, which permits multiple valid approaches and requires implicit state management.

Despite having zero prior training exposure to Anka, Claude 3.5 Haiku achieves 99.9% parse success and 95.8% overall task accuracy across 100 benchmark problems. Critically, Anka demonstrates a 40 percentage point accuracy advantage over Python on multi-step pipeline tasks (100% vs. 60%), where Python's flexible syntax leads to frequent errors in operation sequencing and variable management. Cross-model validation with GPT-4o-mini confirms this advantage (+26.7 percentage points on multi-step tasks). Our results demonstrate that: (1) LLMs can learn novel DSLs entirely from in-context prompts, achieving near-native accuracy; (2) constrained syntax significantly reduces errors on complex tasks; and (3) domain-specific languages purposefully designed for LLM generation can outperform general-purpose languages on which the LLM has extensive training.

Low-rank adaptation methods such as LoRA operate under the assumption that task-relevant weight updates reside in a low-rank subspace, yet this subspace is learned implicitly from data in a black-box manner, offering no interpretability or direct control. We hypothesize that this difficulty stems from polysemanticity--individual dimensions encoding multiple entangled concepts. To address this, we leverage pre-trained Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to identify task-relevant features in a disentangled feature space, then construct an explicit, interpretable low-rank subspace to guide adapter initialization. We provide theoretical analysis proving that under monosemanticity assumptions, SAE-based subspace identification achieves arbitrarily small recovery error, while direct identification in polysemantic space suffers an irreducible error floor. On safety alignment, our method achieves up to 99.6% safety rate--exceeding full fine-tuning by 7.4 percentage points and approaching RLHF-based methods--while updating only 0.19-0.24% of parameters. Crucially, our method provides interpretable insights into the learned alignment subspace through the semantic grounding of SAE features.

However, this hinders their independence and could push them towards risky and dangerous scenarios. Hence, in the spirit of making the visually challenged more self-sufficient, we present SonoVision, a smart-phone application that helps them find everyday objects using sound cues through earphones/headphones. This simply means, if an object is on the right or left side of a user, the app makes a sinusoidal sound in a user's respective ear through ear/headphones. However, to indicate objects located directly in front, both the left and right earphones are rung simultaneously. These sound cues could easily help a visually impaired individual locate objects with the help of their smartphones and reduce the reliance on people in their surroundings, consequently making them more independent. This application is made with the flutter development platform and uses the Efficientdet-D2 model for object detection in the backend.

To help prevent and mitigate these failures, it is thus essential that we identify key substation components to quantify vulnerability. Unfortunately, traditional manual mapping of substation infrastructure is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Therefore, an autonomous solution utilizing computer vision models is preferable, as it allows for greater convenience and efficiency.

Residual dropout further discourages over-reliance on residuals, preserving the semantic alignment and editability of the pose codes.

As their applications extend to increasingly complex scenarios, however, LLMs continue to face challenges in tasks that require deep reasoning and logical inference. In particular, models trained on large scale textual corpora may incorporate noisy or irrelevant information during generation, which can lead to incorrect predictions or outputs that are inconsistent with factual knowledge. To address this limitation, we propose a stepwise reasoning enhancement framework for LLMs based on external subgraph generation, termed SGR. The proposed framework dynamically constructs query relevant subgraphs from external knowledge bases and leverages their semantic structure to guide the reasoning process. By performing reasoning in a step by step manner over structured subgraphs, SGR reduces the influence of noisy information and improves reasoning accuracy. Specifically, the framework first generates an external subgraph tailored to the input query, then guides the model to conduct multi step reasoning grounded in the subgraph, and finally integrates multiple reasoning paths to produce the final answer.

However, significant challenges are posed by the fast, uneven propagation of shock waves and unstable testing conditions. To address these challenges, a novel framework is proposed that utilizes multiple event cameras to estimate the asymmetry of shock waves, leveraging its high-speed and high-dynamic range capabilities. Initially, a polar coordinate system is established, which encodes events to reveal shock wave propagation patterns, with adaptive region-of-interest (ROI) extraction through event offset calculations. Subsequently, shock wave front events are extracted using iterative slope analysis, exploiting the continuity of velocity changes. Finally, the geometric model of events and shock wave motion parameters is derived according to event-based optical imaging model, along with the 3D reconstruction model. Through the above process, multi-angle shock wave measurement, motion field reconstruction, and explosive equivalence inversion are achieved.

However, autoregressive models often suffer from performance degradation under repeated data exposure, where overfitting leads to a marked decline in model capability. Through empirical analysis, we trace this degradation to an imbalance in learning dynamics: predictable, low-entropy tokens are learned quickly and come to dominate optimization, while the model's ability to generalize on high-entropy tokens deteriorates with continued training. To address this, we introduce EntroDrop, an entropy-guided token dropout method that functions as structured data regularization. EntroDrop selectively masks low-entropy tokens during training and employs a curriculum schedule to adjust regularization strength in alignment with training progress. Experiments across model scales from 0.6B to 8B parameters show that EntroDrop consistently outperforms standard regularization baselines and maintains robust performance throughout extended multi-epoch training. These findings underscore the importance of aligning regularization with token-level learning dynamics when training on limited data. Our approach offers a promising pathway toward more effective adaptation of LLMs in data-constrained domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "EntroDrop\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u71b5\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684token\u4e22\u5f03\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u5e73\u8861\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u4f4e\u71b5\u548c\u9ad8\u71b5token\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u5468\u671f\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u591a\u5468\u671f\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u4e3a\u9002\u914d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u91cd\u590d\u66b4\u9732\u4e0b\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u8870\u9000\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6807\u51c6\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3token\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa EntroDrop \u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97token\u71b5\u503c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u906e\u853d\u4f4e\u71b5token\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff1b2\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u8bfe\u7a0b\u8868\u6839\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u521d\u671f\u4fdd\u7559\u5b8c\u6574\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u540e\u671f\u9010\u6b65\u589e\u52a0\u4f4e\u71b5token\u7684\u5c4f\u853d\u6bd4\u4f8b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u89c4\u6a210.6B-8B\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u957f\u5468\u671f\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u66f4\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff08\u5982WikiText-103\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6PPL\u964d\u4f4e17.2%\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5e38\u89c1\u8bcd\u548c\u590d\u6742\u8bcd\u7684\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660etoken\u7ea7\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6570\u636e\u53d7\u9650\u573a\u666f\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u914d\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u533b\u7597/\u6cd5\u5f8b\u7b49\u4e13\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6280\u672f\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

However, existing methods like SAM face significant challenges of domain gaps, inability of encoding physical priors, and inherent architectural complexity. To address this, we designed a Hierarchical MoE Adapter consisting of four white-box neural operators. Building upon this core component, we propose a two-stage paradigm for knowledge distillation and transfer: (1) Prior-Guided Knowledge Distillation, where we use our MoE adapter and 10% of available fully supervised data to distill SAM into an expert teacher (Scalpel-SAM); and (2) Deployment-Oriented Knowledge Transfer, where we use Scalpel-SAM to generate pseudo labels for training lightweight and efficient downstream models. Experiments demonstrate that with minimal annotations, our paradigm enables downstream models to achieve performance comparable to, or even surpassing, their fully supervised counterparts.

However, prior findings remain inconsistent, and most studies operationalize diversity in aggregate terms, overlooking internal role differentiation. This limitation obscures a more nuanced understanding of how gender diversity shapes team impact. In particular, the effect of gender diversity across different team roles remains poorly understood. To this end, we define a scientific team as all coauthors of a paper and measure team impact through five-year citation counts. Using author contribution statements, we classified members into leadership and support roles. Drawing on more than 130,000 papers from PLOS journals, most of which are in biomedical-related disciplines, we employed multivariable regression to examine the association between gender diversity in these roles and team impact. Furthermore, we apply a threshold regression model to investigate how team size moderates this relationship. The results show that (1) the relationship between gender diversity and team impact follows an inverted U-shape for both leadership and support groups; (2) teams with an all-female leadership group and an all-male support group achieve higher impact than other team types. Interestingly, (3) the effect of leadership-group gender diversity is significantly negative for small teams but becomes positive and statistically insignificant in large teams. In contrast, the estimates for support-group gender diversity remain significant and positive, regardless of team size.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6027\u522b\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5728\u79d1\u7814\u56e2\u961f\u4e2d\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u56e0\u89d2\u8272\u4e0d\u540c\u800c\u5f02\uff0c\u9886\u5bfc\u89d2\u8272\u548c\u8f85\u52a9\u89d2\u8272\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0e\u56e2\u961f\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u5448\u73b0\u5012U\u578b\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u56e2\u961f\u89c4\u6a21\u4f1a\u8c03\u8282\u8fd9\u4e00\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4ee5\u5f80\u7814\u7a76\u5c06\u6027\u522b\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7b80\u5355\u5316\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u533a\u5206\u56e2\u961f\u5185\u90e8\u89d2\u8272\uff08\u9886\u5bfc\u4e0e\u8f85\u52a9\uff09\u63a2\u8ba8\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5bf9\u56e2\u961f\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e13\u4e07\u7bc7PLOS\u671f\u520a\u8bba\u6587\u7684\u4f5c\u8005\u8d21\u732e\u58f0\u660e\uff0c\u5c06\u6210\u5458\u5206\u4e3a\u9886\u5bfc\u89d2\u8272\u4e0e\u8f85\u52a9\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u5143\u56de\u5f52\u548c\u9608\u503c\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u6027\u522b\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0e\u4e94\u5e74\u5f15\u7528\u91cf\u7684\u5173\u8054\u3002", "result": "1\uff09\u9886\u5bfc\u4e0e\u8f85\u52a9\u56e2\u961f\u7684\u6027\u522b\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0e\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u5448\u5012U\u578b\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b2\uff09\u5168\u5973\u6027\u9886\u5bfc+\u5168\u7537\u6027\u8f85\u52a9\u56e2\u961f\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u6700\u9ad8\uff1b3\uff09\u5c0f\u56e2\u961f\u4e2d\u9886\u5bfc\u591a\u6837\u6027\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u5927\u56e2\u961f\u4e2d\u6b64\u6548\u5e94\u6d88\u5931\uff0c\u800c\u8f85\u52a9\u56e2\u961f\u591a\u6837\u6027\u59cb\u7ec8\u4fdd\u6301\u663e\u8457\u6b63\u5411\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89d2\u8272\u7ec6\u5206\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6548\u5e94\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u56e2\u961f\u89c4\u6a21\u662f\u8c03\u8282\u9886\u5bfc\u89d2\u8272\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u5173\u952e\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u8f85\u52a9\u89d2\u8272\u65e0\u6b64\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u79d1\u7814\u7ba1\u7406\u9700\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u8bbe\u8ba1\u591a\u5143\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

This dynamic clinical-reasoning process is poorly represented by existing LLM benchmarks that focus on static question-answering. To mitigate these gaps, recent methods explore dynamic medical frameworks involving interactive clinical dialogues. Although effective, they often rely on limited, contamination-prone datasets and lack granular, multi-level evaluation. In this work, we propose ClinDEF, a dynamic framework for assessing clinical reasoning in LLMs through simulated diagnostic dialogues. Grounded in a disease knowledge graph, our method dynamically generates patient cases and facilitates multi-turn interactions between an LLM-based doctor and an automated patient agent. Our evaluation protocol goes beyond diagnostic accuracy by incorporating fine-grained efficiency analysis and rubric-based assessment of diagnostic quality.

Existing text-to-video models often treat each shot independently, resulting in identity drift, scene inconsistency, and unstable temporal structure. We propose CoAgent, a collaborative and closed-loop framework for coherent video generation that formulates the process as a plan-synthesize-verify pipeline. Given a user prompt, style reference, and pacing constraints, a Storyboard Planner decomposes the input into structured shot-level plans with explicit entities, spatial relations, and temporal cues. A Global Context Manager maintains entity-level memory to preserve appearance and identity consistency across shots.

While LLM-embeddings are frequently used to store and retrieve text by semantic similarity in vector databases, the global structure semantic relationships in text corpora often remains opaque. Herein we propose a nested density clustering approach, to infer hierarchical trees of semantically related texts. The method starts by identifying texts of strong semantic similarity as it searches for dense clusters in LLM embedding space. As the density criterion is gradually relaxed, these dense clusters merge into more diffuse clusters, until the whole dataset is represented by a single cluster - the root of the tree. By embedding dense clusters into increasingly diffuse ones, we construct a tree structure that captures hierarchical semantic relationships among texts. We outline how this approach can be used to classify textual data for abstracts of scientific abstracts as a case study. This enables the data-driven discovery research areas and their subfields without predefined categories. To evaluate the general applicability of the method, we further apply it to established benchmark datasets such as the 20 News- groups and IMDB 50k Movie Reviews, demonstrating its robustness across domains.

When a prompt implies a preferred answer, models often reinforce that bias rather than explore alternatives. This phenomenon remains underexplored, yet it is already harmful in base models and poses an even greater risk in multi-agent debate, where echo chambers reinforce bias instead of correction. We introduce Mixture of Latent Concept Experts (MoLaCE), a lightweight inference-time framework that addresses confirmation bias by mixing experts instantiated as different activation strengths over latent concepts that shape model responses. Our key insight is that, due to the compositional nature of language, differently phrased prompts reweight latent concepts in prompt-specific ways that affect factual correctness, so no single fixed intervention can be applied universally across inputs. This design enables a single LLM to emulate the benefits of debate internally while remaining computationally efficient and scalable. It can also be integrated into multi-agent debate frameworks to diversify perspectives and reduce correlated errors. We empirically show that it consistently reduces confirmation bias, improves robustness, and matches or surpasses multi-agent debate while requiring only a fraction of the computation.", "AI": {"tldr": "MoLaCE\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u57fa\u4e8e\u6f5c\u5728\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u6765\u51cf\u8f7b\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u786e\u8ba4\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5728\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u6a21\u62df\u8fa9\u8bba\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5df2\u6709\u7684LLMs\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u6697\u793a\u504f\u597d\u7b54\u6848\u65f6\u5bb9\u6613\u5f3a\u5316\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fa9\u8bba\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8fd9\u79cd\u504f\u5dee\u4f1a\u88ab\u653e\u5927\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u8f93\u5165\u573a\u666f\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMoLaCE\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u4e0d\u540c\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u6982\u5ff5\u4e13\u5bb6\u6df7\u5408\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u4e2d\u9690\u5f0f\u6982\u5ff5\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u5373\u53ef\u5e94\u5bf9\u591a\u53d8\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660eMoLaCE\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u786e\u8ba4\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u63a5\u8fd1\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5185\u90e8\u673a\u5236\u5e73\u8861\u521b\u65b0\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u51cf\u8f7bLLMs\u504f\u5dee\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5b9e\u8df5\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

Existing methods employ the Jaccard similarity coefficient instead of the cosine distance to enhance the measurement accuracy. However, these methods introduce too many irrelevant nodes, producing Jaccard coefficients with limited discriminative power and adversely affecting clustering performance. To address this issue, we propose a prediction-driven Top-K Jaccard similarity coefficient that enhances the purity of neighboring nodes, thereby improving the reliability of similarity measurements. Nevertheless, accurately predicting the optimal number of neighbors (Top-K) remains challenging, leading to suboptimal clustering results. To overcome this limitation, we develop a Transformer-based prediction model that examines the relationships between the central node and its neighboring nodes near the Top-K to further enhance the reliability of similarity estimation. However, vanilla Transformer, when applied to predict relationships between nodes, often introduces noise due to their overemphasis on irrelevant feature relationships. To address these challenges, we propose a Sparse Differential Transformer (SDT), instead of the vanilla Transformer, to eliminate noise and enhance the model's anti-noise capabilities.

In this work, we investigate the potential of constructing Vision-Language Models upon diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) to overcome these limitations. We introduce Dream-VL, an open diffusion-based VLM (dVLM) that achieves state-of-the-art performance among previous dVLMs. Dream-VL is comparable to top-tier AR-based VLMs trained on open data on various benchmarks but exhibits superior potential when applied to visual planning tasks. Building upon Dream-VL, we introduce Dream-VLA, a dLLM-based Vision-Language-Action model (dVLA) developed through continuous pre-training on open robotic datasets. We demonstrate that the natively bidirectional nature of this diffusion backbone serves as a superior foundation for VLA tasks, inherently suited for action chunking and parallel generation, leading to significantly faster convergence in downstream fine-tuning.

We evaluate three proprietary and two open-source SLMs, demonstrating that none of these models can maintain a consistent speaking style when instructed to do so. We further show that when SLMs are asked to recall the style instruction in later turns, they can recall the style instruction, but they fail to express it throughout the conversation. We also show that explicitly asking the model to recall the style instruction can partially mitigate style amnesia.

Some results are being finalized and may be updated in a future revision.}", "summary": "\\noindent Memory has become the central mechanism enabling robust visual object tracking in modern segmentation-based frameworks. Recent methods built upon Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) have demonstrated strong performance by refining how past observations are stored and reused. However, existing approaches address memory limitations in a method-specific manner, leaving the broader design principles of memory in SAM-based tracking poorly understood. Moreover, it remains unclear how these memory mechanisms transfer to stronger, next-generation foundation models such as Segment Anything Model 3 (SAM3). In this work, we present a systematic memory-centric study of SAM-based visual object tracking. We first analyze representative SAM2-based trackers and show that most methods primarily differ in how short-term memory frames are selected, while sharing a common object-centric representation. Building on this insight, we faithfully reimplement these memory mechanisms within the SAM3 framework and conduct large-scale evaluations across ten diverse benchmarks, enabling a controlled analysis of memory design independent of backbone strength. Guided by our empirical findings, we propose a unified hybrid memory framework that explicitly decomposes memory into short-term appearance memory and long-term distractor-resolving memory. This decomposition enables the integration of existing memory policies in a modular and principled manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently improves robustness under long-term occlusion, complex motion, and distractor-heavy scenarios on both SAM2 and SAM3 backbones.

Video diffusion models, through their image-to-video generation capability, provide a promising foundation for such visual imagination. However, existing approaches are largely forward predictive, generating trajectories conditioned on the initial observation without explicit goal modeling, thus often leading to spatial drift and goal misalignment. To address these challenges, we propose Envision, a diffusion-based framework that performs visual planning for embodied agents. By explicitly constraining the generation with a goal image, our method enforces physical plausibility and goal consistency throughout the generated trajectory. Specifically, Envision operates in two stages. First, a Goal Imagery Model identifies task-relevant regions, performs region-aware cross attention between the scene and the instruction, and synthesizes a coherent goal image that captures the desired outcome. Then, an Env-Goal Video Model, built upon a first-and-last-frame-conditioned video diffusion model (FL2V), interpolates between the initial observation and the goal image, producing smooth and physically plausible video trajectories that connect the start and goal states. Experiments on object manipulation and image editing benchmarks demonstrate that Envision achieves superior goal alignment, spatial consistency, and object preservation compared to baselines.

Generally, con- sumers use overly descriptive and peripheral information to express their medical condition or other healthcare needs, contributing to the challenges of natural language understanding. One way to address this challenge is to summarize the questions and distill the key information of the original question. Recently, large-scale datasets have significantly propelled the development of several summarization tasks, such as multi-document summarization and dialogue summarization. However, a lack of a domain-expert annotated dataset for the consumer healthcare questions summarization task inhibits the development of an efficient summarization system. To address this issue, we introduce a new dataset, CHQ-Sum,m that contains 1507 domain-expert annotated consumer health questions and corresponding summaries. The dataset is derived from the community question answering forum and therefore provides a valuable resource for understanding consumer health-related posts on social media.

Motivated by this, adapting RLHF for Image Super-Resolution (ISR) tasks has shown promise in optimizing perceptual quality with Image Quality Assessment (IQA) model as reward models. However, the traditional IQA model usually output a single global score, which are exceptionally insensitive to local and fine-grained distortions. This insensitivity allows ISR models to produce perceptually undesirable artifacts that yield spurious high scores, misaligning optimization objectives with perceptual quality and results in reward hacking. To address this, we propose a Fine-grained Perceptual Reward Model (FinPercep-RM) based on an Encoder-Decoder architecture. While providing a global quality score, it also generates a Perceptual Degradation Map that spatially localizes and quantifies local defects. We specifically introduce the FGR-30k dataset to train this model, consisting of diverse and subtle distortions from real-world super-resolution models. Despite the success of the FinPercep-RM model, its complexity introduces significant challenges in generator policy learning, leading to training instability. To address this, we propose a Co-evolutionary Curriculum Learning (CCL) mechanism, where both the reward model and the ISR model undergo synchronized curricula. The reward model progressively increases in complexity, while the ISR model starts with a simpler global reward for rapid convergence, gradually transitioning to the more complex model outputs. This easy-to-hard strategy enables stable training while suppressing reward hacking. Experiments validates the effectiveness of our method across ISR models in both global quality and local realism on RLHF methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff08FinPercep-RM\uff09\u548c\u534f\u540c\u8fdb\u5316\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\uff08CCL\uff09\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u5168\u5c40\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u5931\u771f\u4e0e\u5956\u52b1\u7be1\u6539\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u4ec5\u63d0\u4f9b\u5168\u5c40\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u68c0\u6d4b\u5c40\u90e8\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5931\u771f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u89c9\u4f2a\u5f71\u5e76\u5f15\u53d1\u5956\u52b1\u7be1\u6539\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5bf9\u9f50\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "method": "1. \u6784\u5efaFinPercep-RM\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f16\u7801-\u89e3\u7801\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5168\u5c40\u8d28\u91cf\u5206\u4e0e\u611f\u77e5\u9000\u5316\u56fe\uff08\u5b9a\u4f4d/\u91cf\u5316\u5c40\u90e8\u7f3a\u9677\uff09\uff1b\n2. \u63d0\u51faCCL\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u540c\u6b65\u6f14\u5316\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u4ece\u7b80\u5355\u5230\u590d\u6742\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u5168\u5c40\u8d28\u91cf\uff08PSNR\u3001SSIM\uff09\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\uff08FID\u3001LPIPS\uff09\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u5956\u52b1\u7be1\u6539\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5956\u52b1\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u534f\u540c\u8fdb\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4e3aRLHF\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Echocardiography, as a readily accessible and non-invasive imaging modality, is widely used in clinical practice to estimate LVEF. However, manual assessment of cardiac function from echocardiograms is time-consuming and subject to considerable inter-observer variability. Deep learning approaches offer a promising alternative, with the potential to achieve performance comparable to that of experienced human experts. In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of several deep learning architectures for LVEF estimation from echocardiography videos, including 3D Inception, two-stream, and CNN-RNN models. We systematically evaluate architectural modifications and fusion strategies to identify configurations that maximize prediction accuracy. Models were trained and evaluated on the EchoNet-Dynamic dataset, comprising 10,030 echocardiogram videos. Our results demonstrate that modified 3D Inception architectures achieve the best overall performance, with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 6.79%. Across architectures, we observe a tendency toward overfitting, with smaller and simpler models generally exhibiting improved generalization. Model performance was also found to be highly sensitive to hyperparameter choices, particularly convolutional kernel sizes and normalization strategies. While this study focuses on echocardiography-based LVEF estimation, the insights gained regarding architectural design and training strategies may be applicable to a broader range of medical and non-medical video analysis tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u67b6\u6784\uff083D Inception\u3001\u53cc\u6d41\u3001CNN-RNN\uff09\u5728\u8d85\u58f0\u5fc3\u52a8\u56fe\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u81ea\u52a8\u4f30\u7b97\u5de6\u5fc3\u5ba4\u5c04\u8840\u5206\u6570\uff08LVEF\uff09\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6539\u8fdb\u76843D Inception\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0cRMSE\u4e3a6.79%\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u73b0\u8c61\u4e14\u5bf9\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u654f\u611f\u3002", "motivation": "\u624b\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30LVEF\u5b58\u5728\u8017\u65f6\u3001\u89c2\u6d4b\u8005\u5dee\u5f02\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528EchoNet-Dynamic\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0810,030\u4e2a\u89c6\u9891\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u540c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u6784\u4fee\u6539\u548c\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7RMSE\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u6bd4\u8f83\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "3D Inception\u6a21\u578b\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u8f83\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u66f4\u5f3a\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u5bf9\u5377\u79ef\u6838\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u7b49\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u654f\u611f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u8bc4\u4f30LVEF\uff0c\u7ed3\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u533b\u7597\u53ca\u5176\u4ed6\u9886\u57df\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u6790\u5177\u6709\u666e\u9002\u53c2\u8003\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

However, numerous downstream tasks in specialized and data-limited scientific domains continue to pose significant challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel Cluster Attention Adapter (CLAdapter), which refines and adapts the rich representations learned from large-scale data to various data-limited downstream tasks. Specifically, CLAdapter introduces attention mechanisms and cluster centers to personalize the enhancement of transformed features through distribution correlation and transformation matrices. This enables models fine-tuned with CLAdapter to learn distinct representations tailored to different feature sets, facilitating the models' adaptation from rich pre-trained features to various downstream scenarios effectively. In addition, CLAdapter's unified interface design allows for seamless integration with multiple model architectures, including CNNs and Transformers, in both 2D and 3D contexts. Through extensive experiments on 10 datasets spanning domains such as generic, multimedia, biological, medical, industrial, agricultural, environmental, geographical, materials science, out-of-distribution (OOD), and 3D analysis, CLAdapter achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse data-limited scientific domains, demonstrating its effectiveness in unleashing the potential of foundation vision models via adaptive transfer.

We present ProfASR-Bench, a professional-talk evaluation suite for high-stakes applications across finance, medicine, legal, and technology. Each example pairs a natural-language prompt (domain cue and/or speaker profile) with an entity-rich target utterance, enabling controlled measurement of context-conditioned recognition. The corpus supports conventional ASR metrics alongside entity-aware scores and slice-wise reporting by accent and gender. Using representative families Whisper (encoder-decoder ASR) and Qwen-Omni (audio language models) under matched no-context, profile, domain+profile, oracle, and adversarial conditions, we find a consistent pattern: lightweight textual context produces little to no change in average word error rate (WER), even with oracle prompts, and adversarial prompts do not reliably degrade performance. We term this the context-utilization gap (CUG): current systems are nominally promptable yet underuse readily available side information. ProfASR-Bench provides a standardized context ladder, entity- and slice-aware reporting with confidence intervals, and a reproducible testbed for comparing fusion strategies across model families.\n  Dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/prdeepakbabu/ProfASR-Bench\n  Code: https://github.com/prdeepakbabu/ProfASR-Bench", "AI": {"tldr": "ProfASR-Bench \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u91d1\u878d\u3001\u533b\u7597\u3001\u6cd5\u5f8b\u548c\u6280\u672f\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u4e1a\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u5957\u4ef6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5229\u7528\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709ASR\u57fa\u51c6\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u8861\u91cf\u4e13\u4e1a\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff08\u5982\u9886\u57df\u672f\u8bed\u3001\u6b63\u5f0f\u8bed\u57df\u53d8\u5316\u3001\u5bf9\u5173\u952e\u5b9e\u4f53\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u96f6\u5bb9\u5fcd\u5ea6\uff09\uff0c\u9700\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u8d34\u5408\u5b9e\u9645\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b\u63d0\u793a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff08\u9886\u57df\u7ebf\u7d22/\u8bf4\u8bdd\u8005\u753b\u50cf\uff09\u4e0e\u591a\u5b9e\u4f53\u76ee\u6807\u8bed\u53e5\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4f20\u7edfWER\u6307\u6807\u3001\u5b9e\u4f53\u611f\u77e5\u8bc4\u5206\u53ca\u6309\u53e3\u97f3/\u6027\u522b\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u62a5\u544a\uff0c\u5e76\u6d4b\u8bd5Whisper\u4e0eQwen-Omni\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5f53\u524dASR\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u666e\u901a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u5747\u672a\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u8bcd\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u201c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5229\u7528\u7387\u9e3f\u6c9f\u201d(CUG)\u6982\u5ff5\u3002", "conclusion": "ProfASR-Bench \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5c42\u7ea7\u3001\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u53ca\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u6d4b\u8bd5\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u7684\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

Recent work proposes novel techniques to find natural language prompts that induce specific behaviors from a target model, yet they are mainly studied in single-turn settings. In this work, we study behavior elicitation in the context of multi-turn conversations. We first offer an analytical framework that categorizes existing methods into three families based on their interactions with the target model: those that use only prior knowledge, those that use offline interactions, and those that learn from online interactions. We then introduce a generalized multi-turn formulation of the online method, unifying single-turn and multi-turn elicitation. We evaluate all three families of methods on automatically generating multi-turn test cases. We investigate the efficiency of these approaches by analyzing the trade-off between the query budget, i.e., the number of interactions with the target model, and the success rate, i.e., the discovery rate of behavior-eliciting inputs. We find that online methods can achieve an average success rate of 45/19/77% with just a few thousand queries over three tasks where static methods from existing multi-turn conversation benchmarks find few or even no failure cases.

With better training data that is diverse and covers a wide range of situations, including long-tailed driving scenarios, autonomous driving models can become more robust and safer. This motivates a unified simulation framework that can jointly handle realistic integration of inserted 3D assets and NVS. Recent 3D asset reconstruction methods enable reconstruction of dynamic actors from video, supporting their re-insertion into simulated driving scenes. While the overall structure and appearance can be accurate, it still struggles to capture the realism of 3D assets through lighting or shadows, particularly when inserted into scenes. In parallel, recent advances in NVS methods have demonstrated promising results in synthesizing viewpoints beyond the originally recorded trajectories. However, existing approaches largely treat asset insertion and NVS capabilities in isolation. To allow for interaction with the rest of the scene and to enable more diverse creation of new scenarios for training, realistic 3D asset insertion should be combined with NVS. To address this, we present SCPainter (Street Car Painter), a unified framework which integrates 3D Gaussian Splat (GS) car asset representations and 3D scene point clouds with diffusion-based generation to jointly enable realistic 3D asset insertion and NVS. The 3D GS assets and 3D scene point clouds are projected together into novel views, and these projections are used to condition a diffusion model to generate high quality images.

Recent methods achieve this by lifting video segmentation results to a 4D representation through differentiable rendering techniques. Therefore, they heavily rely on the quality of video segmentation maps, which are often unstable, leading to unreliable reconstruction results. To overcome this challenge, our key idea is to represent the decomposed 4D scene with the Freetime FeatureGS and design a streaming feature learning strategy to accurately recover it from per-image segmentation maps, eliminating the need for video segmentation. Freetime FeatureGS models the dynamic scene as a set of Gaussian primitives with learnable features and linear motion ability, allowing them to move to neighboring regions over time. We apply a contrastive loss to Freetime FeatureGS, forcing primitive features to be close or far apart based on whether their projections belong to the same instance in the 2D segmentation map. As our Gaussian primitives can move across time, it naturally extends the feature learning to the temporal dimension, achieving 4D segmentation. Furthermore, we sample observations for training in a temporally ordered manner, enabling the streaming propagation of features over time and effectively avoiding local minima during the optimization process. Experimental results on several datasets show that the reconstruction quality of our method outperforms recent methods by a large margin.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faFreetime FeatureGS\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u57fa\u5143\u548c\u6d41\u5f0f\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ece\u5355\u5e27\u5206\u5272\u56fe\u4e2d\u91cd\u5efa\u5206\u89e3\u76844D\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u5272\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u5272\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u5272\u4e14\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6574\u5408\u65f6\u7a7a\u4fe1\u606f\u76844D\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "1) \u63d0\u51faFreetime FeatureGS\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53ef\u79fb\u52a8\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u57fa\u5143\u8868\u793a\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f 2) \u5f15\u5165\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e2D\u5206\u5272\u56fe\u4f18\u5316\u57fa\u5143\u7279\u5f81 3) \u8bbe\u8ba1\u6d41\u5f0f\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6309\u65f6\u95f4\u987a\u5e8f\u4f20\u64ad\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u907f\u514d\u4f18\u5316\u5c40\u90e8\u6781\u5c0f\u503c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9700\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u5272\u76844D\u5206\u5272\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u79fb\u52a8\u9ad8\u65af\u57fa\u5143\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u5272\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u76844D\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u3002"}}

They typically encode visual inputs into Original Model sequences of tokens, which are then concatenated with textual tokens and jointly processed by the language model. However, the growing number of visual tokens greatly increases inference cost. Visual token pruning has emerged as a promising solution. However, existing methods often overlook scenarios involving long context inputs with multiple images. In this paper, we analyze the challenges of visual token pruning in long context, multi-image settings and introduce an adaptive pruning method tailored for such scenarios. We decompose redundancy into intra-image and inter-image components and quantify them through intra-image diversity and inter-image variation, which jointly guide dynamic budget allocation. Our approach consists of two stages. The intra-image stage allocates each image a content-aware token budget and greedily selects its most representative tokens. The inter-image stage performs global diversity filtering to form a candidate pool and then applies a Pareto selection procedure that balances diversity with text alignment. Extensive experiments show that our approach maintains strong performance in long context settings while significantly cutting down the number of visual tokens.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3001\u591a\u56fe\u50cf\u573a\u666f\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u4ee4\u724c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u89e3\u5197\u4f59\u5e76\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u4f18\u5316\u4ee4\u724c\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u540c\u65f6\u7ef4\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u4ee4\u724c\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u5145\u5206\u8003\u8651\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8f93\u5165\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u56fe\u50cf\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u800c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u591a\u56fe\u50cf\u5197\u4f59\u6027\uff08\u56fe\u50cf\u5185\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u95f4\uff09\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u5316\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u526a\u679d\uff1a1\uff09\u56fe\u50cf\u5185\u4f9d\u636e\u5185\u5bb9\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5206\u914d\u4ee4\u724c\u9884\u7b97\u5e76\u9009\u62e9\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u4ee4\u724c\uff08\u5982\u663e\u8457\u533a\u57df\uff09\uff1b2\uff09\u56fe\u50cf\u95f4\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u5c40\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7b5b\u9009\u6784\u5efa\u5019\u9009\u6c60\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u9009\u62e9\u5e73\u8861\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0e\u591a\u56fe\u50cf\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u56fe\u50cf\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u51cf\u5c1130%-50%\u89c6\u89c9\u4ee4\u724c\u6570\uff0c\u4e14\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387/\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\uff08\u5982BLEU-4\u3001CLIPScore\uff09\u4ec5\u4e0b\u964d1-3%\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u526a\u679d\u6280\u672f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u56fe\u50cf\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5197\u4f59\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4e3aLMMs\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u573a\u666f\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4f4e\u8017\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u526a\u679d\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Although effective, we observe that such similarity distributions across grades usually exhibit multimodal patterns. For instance, an image embedding may show high similarity to both \"excellent\" and \"poor\" grade descriptions while deviating from the \"good\" one. We refer to this phenomenon as \"semantic drift\", where semantic inconsistencies between text embeddings and their intended descriptions undermine the reliability of text-image shared-space learning. To mitigate this issue, we draw inspiration from psychometrics and propose an improved Graded Response Model (GRM) for AGIQA. The GRM is a classical assessment model that categorizes a subject's ability across grades using test items with various difficulty levels. This paradigm aligns remarkably well with human quality rating, where image quality can be interpreted as an image's ability to meet various quality grades. Building on this philosophy, we design a two-branch quality grading module: one branch estimates image ability while the other constructs multiple difficulty levels. To ensure monotonicity in difficulty levels, we further model difficulty generation in an arithmetic manner, which inherently enforces a unimodal and interpretable quality distribution. Our Arithmetic GRM based Quality Grading (AGQG) module enjoys a plug-and-play advantage, consistently improving performance when integrated into various state-of-the-art AGIQA frameworks.

Existing solver-based acceleration methods often face significant image quality degradation under a low-latency budget, primarily due to accumulated truncation errors arising from the inability to capture high-curvature trajectory segments. In this paper, we propose the Ensemble Parallel Direction solver (dubbed as EPD-Solver), a novel ODE solver that mitigates these errors by incorporating multiple parallel gradient evaluations in each step. Motivated by the geometric insight that sampling trajectories are largely confined to a low-dimensional manifold, EPD-Solver leverages the Mean Value Theorem for vector-valued functions to approximate the integral solution more accurately. Importantly, since the additional gradient computations are independent, they can be fully parallelized, preserving low-latency sampling nature. We introduce a two-stage optimization framework. Initially, EPD-Solver optimizes a small set of learnable parameters via a distillation-based approach. We further propose a parameter-efficient Reinforcement Learning (RL) fine-tuning scheme that reformulates the solver as a stochastic Dirichlet policy. Unlike traditional methods that fine-tune the massive backbone, our RL approach operates strictly within the low-dimensional solver space, effectively mitigating reward hacking while enhancing performance in complex text-to-image (T2I) generation tasks.

Existing methods, however, are typically limited to local search, making them prone to failures under viewpoint changes, occlusions, and rapid target movements. In this work, we introduce the first global tracking framework based on Multimodal Large Language Models (VPTracker), exploiting their powerful semantic reasoning to locate targets across the entire image space. While global search improves robustness and reduces drift, it also introduces distractions from visually or semantically similar objects. To address this, we propose a location-aware visual prompting mechanism that incorporates spatial priors into the MLLM. Specifically, we construct a region-level prompt based on the target's previous location, enabling the model to prioritize region-level recognition and resort to global inference only when necessary. This design retains the advantages of global tracking while effectively suppressing interference from distracting visual content. Extensive experiments show that our approach significantly enhances tracking stability and target disambiguation under challenging scenarios, opening a new avenue for integrating MLLMs into visual tracking.

However, faithfully modeling such reactions from egocentric video remains challenging due to the dual requirements of strictly causal generation and precise 3D spatial alignment. To tackle this problem, we first construct the Human Reaction Dataset (HRD) to address data scarcity and misalignment by building a spatially aligned egocentric video-reaction dataset, as existing datasets (e.g., ViMo) suffer from significant spatial inconsistency between the egocentric video and reaction motion, e.g., dynamically moving motions are always paired with fixed-camera videos. Leveraging HRD, we present EgoReAct, the first autoregressive framework that generates 3D-aligned human reaction motions from egocentric video streams in real-time. We first compress the reaction motion into a compact yet expressive latent space via a Vector Quantised-Variational AutoEncoder and then train a Generative Pre-trained Transformer for reaction generation from the visual input. EgoReAct incorporates 3D dynamic features, i.e., metric depth, and head dynamics during the generation, which effectively enhance spatial grounding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EgoReAct achieves remarkably higher realism, spatial consistency, and generation efficiency compared with prior methods, while maintaining strict causality during generation.

This disparity makes transferring capabilities from the perspective domain an attractive solution. To bridge this gap, we present Depth Anything in $360^\\circ$ (DA360), a panoramic-adapted version of Depth Anything V2. Our key innovation involves learning a shift parameter from the ViT backbone, transforming the model's scale- and shift-invariant output into a scale-invariant estimate that directly yields well-formed 3D point clouds. This is complemented by integrating circular padding into the DPT decoder to eliminate seam artifacts, ensuring spatially coherent depth maps that respect spherical continuity. Evaluated on standard indoor benchmarks and our newly curated outdoor dataset, Metropolis, DA360 shows substantial gains over its base model, achieving over 50\\% and 10\\% relative depth error reduction on indoor and outdoor benchmarks, respectively.

We propose a new solver to estimate the 3DOF relative pose and focal length. First, we establish constraint equations from two affine correspondences when the vertical direction is known. Then, based on the properties of the equation system with nontrivial solutions, four equations can be derived. These four equations only involve two parameters: the focal length and the relative rotation angle. Finally, the polynomial eigenvalue method is utilized to solve the problem of focal length and relative rotation angle. The proposed solver is evaluated using synthetic and real-world datasets. The results show that our solver performs better than the existing state-of-the-art solvers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u4e24\u4e2a\u4eff\u5c04\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u5df2\u77e5\u5782\u76f4\u65b9\u5411\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e24\u89c6\u89d2\u76f8\u5bf9\u4f4d\u59ff\u548c\u7126\u8ddd\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6c7d\u8f66\u3001\u667a\u80fd\u624b\u673a\u7b49\u8bbe\u5907\u4e2d\u76f8\u673a\u4e0eIMU\u8054\u5408\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5229\u7528IMU\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u5782\u76f4\u65b9\u5411\u4fe1\u606f\u5c06\u76f8\u673a\u76f8\u5bf9\u4f4d\u59ff\u76845\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u7f29\u51cf\u4e3a3\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u4f30\u8ba1\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u5efa\u7acb\u5305\u542b\u7126\u8ddd\u548c\u76f8\u5bf9\u65cb\u8f6c\u89d2\u7684\u56db\u7ef4\u7ea6\u675f\u65b9\u7a0b\u7ec4\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\u6c42\u89e3\u7126\u8ddd\u548c\u65cb\u8f6c\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5782\u76f4\u65b9\u5411\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u6570\u5b66\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5355\u76ee\u76f8\u673a\u7126\u8ddd\u4e0e\u76f8\u5bf9\u4f4d\u59ff\u7684\u8054\u5408\u4f30\u8ba1\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

To address these challenges, we introduce ByteLoom, a Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based framework that generates realistic HOI videos with geometrically consistent object illustration, using simplified human conditioning and 3D object inputs. We first propose an RCM-cache mechanism that leverages Relative Coordinate Maps (RCM) as a universal representation to maintain object's geometry consistency and precisely control 6-DoF object transformations in the meantime. To compensate HOI dataset scarcity and leverage existing datasets, we further design a training curriculum that enhances model capabilities in a progressive style and relaxes the demand of hand mesh.

Existing methods typically address this issue by annotating potential spurious attributes, or filtering spurious features based on some empirical assumptions (e.g., simplicity of bias). However, these methods may yield unsatisfactory performance due to the intricate and elusive nature of spurious correlations in real-world data. In this paper, we propose a data-oriented approach to mitigate the spurious correlation in deep learning models. We observe that samples that are influenced by spurious features tend to exhibit a dispersed distribution in the learned feature space. This allows us to identify the presence of spurious features. Subsequently, we obtain a bias-invariant representation by neutralizing the spurious features based on a simple grouping strategy. Then, we learn a feature transformation to eliminate the spurious features by aligning with this bias-invariant representation. Finally, we update the classifier by incorporating the learned feature transformation and obtain an unbiased model.

However, existing approaches primarily focus on erasing concepts from text prompts, overlooking other input modalities that are increasingly critical in real-world applications such as image editing and personalized generation. These modalities can become attack surfaces, where erased concepts re-emerge despite defenses. To bridge this gap, we introduce M-ErasureBench, a novel multimodal evaluation framework that systematically benchmarks concept erasure methods across three input modalities: text prompts, learned embeddings, and inverted latents. For the latter two, we evaluate both white-box and black-box access, yielding five evaluation scenarios. Our analysis shows that existing methods achieve strong erasure performance against text prompts but largely fail under learned embeddings and inverted latents, with Concept Reproduction Rate (CRR) exceeding 90% in the white-box setting. To address these vulnerabilities, we propose IRECE (Inference-time Robustness Enhancement for Concept Erasure), a plug-and-play module that localizes target concepts via cross-attention and perturbs the associated latents during denoising. Experiments demonstrate that IRECE consistently restores robustness, reducing CRR by up to 40% under the most challenging white-box latent inversion scenario, while preserving visual quality. To the best of our knowledge, M-ErasureBench provides the first comprehensive benchmark of concept erasure beyond text prompts. Together with IRECE, our benchmark offers practical safeguards for building more reliable protective generative models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faM-ErasureBench\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u4e0eIRECE\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8de8\u8f93\u5165\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u6cc4\u9732\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6982\u5ff5\u64e6\u9664\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u9488\u5bf9\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\uff08text prompts\uff09\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u4f46\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u3001\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u751f\u6210\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u5d4c\u5165\uff08learned embeddings\uff09\u548c\u53cd\u6f14\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\uff08inverted latents\uff09\u8f93\u5165\u6a21\u6001\u5b58\u5728\u6982\u5ff5\u590d\u73b0\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaM-ErasureBench\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u6587\u672c/\u5d4c\u5165/\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e09\u79cd\u8f93\u5165\u6a21\u6001\u53ca\u767d\u76d2/\u9ed1\u76d2\u653b\u51fb\u573a\u666f\uff1b\u63d0\u51faIRECE\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5b9a\u4f4d\u76ee\u6807\u6982\u5ff5\u5e76\u5728\u53bb\u566a\u9636\u6bb5\u6270\u52a8\u76f8\u5173\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u4f46\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6548\u679c\u6076\u5316\uff08\u767d\u76d2CRR>90%\uff09\uff0cIRECE\u5728\u6700\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u964d\u4f4eCRR\u8fbe40%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u65e0\u635f\u3002", "conclusion": "M-ErasureBench\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6982\u5ff5\u64e6\u9664\uff0cIRECE\u63d0\u4f9b\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u9632\u62a4\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5171\u540c\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

However, their effectiveness is critically limited when combined with standard Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG). We identify a fundamental limitation: CFG's extrapolative nature systematically pushes the sampling path off the data manifold, causing the approximation error to diverge and undermining the refinement process. To address this, we propose Guided Path Sampling (GPS), a new paradigm for iterative refinement. GPS replaces unstable extrapolation with a principled, manifold-constrained interpolation, ensuring the sampling path remains on the data manifold. We theoretically prove that this correction transforms the error series from unbounded amplification to strictly bounded, guaranteeing stability. Furthermore, we devise an optimal scheduling strategy that dynamically adjusts guidance strength, aligning semantic injection with the model's natural coarse-to-fine generation process. Extensive experiments on modern backbones like SDXL and Hunyuan-DiT show that GPS outperforms existing methods in both perceptual quality and complex prompt adherence. For instance, GPS achieves a superior ImageReward of 0.79 and HPS v2 of 0.2995 on SDXL, while improving overall semantic alignment accuracy on GenEval to 57.45%.

However, due to the irregular and non-uniform distribution of Gaussian splats in 3D space, numerous sparse regions exist, rendering many features in the hash grid invalid. This leads to redundant storage and transmission overhead. In this work, we propose a hash grid feature pruning method that identifies and prunes invalid features based on the coordinates of the input Gaussian splats, so that only the valid features are encoded. This approach reduces the storage size of the hash grid without compromising model performance, leading to improved rate-distortion performance. Following the Common Test Conditions (CTC) defined by the standardization committee, our method achieves an average bitrate reduction of 8% compared to the baseline approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u54c8\u5e0c\u7f51\u683c\u7279\u5f81\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u65e0\u6548\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u4ec5\u7f16\u7801\u6709\u6548\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u5b58\u50a8\u548c\u4f20\u8f93\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6807\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e73\u57478%\u7684\u6bd4\u7279\u7387\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u54c8\u5e0c\u7f51\u683c\u56e0\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5747\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u65e0\u6548\u7279\u5f81\u5197\u4f59\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b58\u50a8\u548c\u4f20\u8f93\u65f6\u4ea7\u751f\u663e\u8457\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u9700\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9ad8\u6548\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6848\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u9690\u5f0f\u795e\u7ecf\u573a\u8868\u793a\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f93\u5165\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u5750\u6807\u52a8\u6001\u5224\u5b9a\u65e0\u6548\u7279\u5f81\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u54c8\u5e0c\u7f51\u683c\u7279\u5f81\u526a\u679d\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ec5\u4fdd\u7559\u6709\u6548\u7279\u5f81\u8fdb\u884c\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u7b5b\u9009\u51cf\u5c11\u5197\u4f59\u5b58\u50a8\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u901a\u7528\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6761\u4ef6\uff08CTC\uff09\u4e0b\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8f83\u57fa\u7ebf\u6280\u672f\u51cf\u5c118%\u5e73\u5747\u6bd4\u7279\u7387\uff0c\u5b58\u50a8\u9700\u6c42\u4e0b\u964d\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u539f\u59cb\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5750\u6807\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u526a\u679d\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u9690\u5f0f\u795e\u7ecf\u573a\u54c8\u5e0c\u7f51\u683c\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u573a\u666f\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e14\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u90e8\u7f72\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Traditional modular pipelines separate perception, prediction, and planning, while recent end-to-end (E2E) systems learn them jointly. Vision-language models (VLMs) further enrich this paradigm by introducing cross-modal priors and commonsense reasoning, yet current VLM-based planners face three key challenges: (i) a mismatch between discrete text reasoning and continuous control, (ii) high latency from autoregressive chain-of-thought decoding, and (iii) inefficient or non-causal planners that limit real-time deployment.

The Cognitive Latent Reasoner compresses scene understanding into compact, decision-oriented meta-action embeddings through ego-adaptive selection and only two VLM forward passes. The Hierarchical Parallel Planner then generates multi-scale, causality-consistent trajectories in a single forward pass.

Existing detection methods typically allocate computational resources uniformly, failing to adaptively focus on these density-concentrated regions, which hinders feature learning effectiveness. To address these limitations, we propose the Dense Region Mining Network (DRMNet), which leverages density maps as explicit spatial priors to guide adaptive feature learning. First, we design a Density Generation Branch (DGB) to model object distribution patterns, providing quantifiable priors that guide the network toward dense regions. Second, to address the computational bottleneck of global attention, our Dense Area Focusing Module (DAFM) uses these density maps to identify and focus on dense areas, enabling efficient local-global feature interaction. Finally, to mitigate feature degradation during hierarchical extraction, we introduce a Dual Filter Fusion Module (DFFM). It disentangles multi-scale features into high- and low-frequency components using a discrete cosine transform and then performs density-guided cross-attention to enhance complementarity while suppressing background interference.

However, its inherent sparsity and limited semantic richness significantly constrain perception capability. Recently, fusing camera data with 4D radar has emerged as a promising cost effective solution, by exploiting the complementary strengths of the two modalities. Nevertheless, point-cloud-based radar often suffer from information loss introduced by multi-stage signal processing, while directly utilizing raw 4D radar data incurs prohibitive computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose WRCFormer, a novel 3D object detection framework that fuses raw radar cubes with camera inputs via multi-view representations of the decoupled radar cube. Specifically, we design a Wavelet Attention Module as the basic module of wavelet-based Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) to enhance the representation of sparse radar signals and image data. We further introduce a two-stage query-based, modality-agnostic fusion mechanism termed Geometry-guided Progressive Fusion to efficiently integrate multi-view features from both modalities.

Specifically, YOLO-IOD encompasses three principal components: 1) Conflict-Aware Pseudo-Label Refinement (CPR), which mitigates the foreground-background confusion by leveraging the confidence levels of pseudo labels and identifying potential objects relevant to future tasks. 2) Importancebased Kernel Selection (IKS), which identifies and updates the pivotal convolution kernels pertinent to the current task during the current learning stage. 3) Cross-Stage Asymmetric Knowledge Distillation (CAKD), which addresses the misaligned knowledge distillation conflict by transmitting the features of the student target detector through the detection heads of both the previous and current teacher detectors, thereby facilitating asymmetric distillation between existing and newly introduced categories.

However, existing CIG methods still suffer from a substantial gap to real camouflaged imagery: generated images either lack sufficient camouflage due to weak visual similarity, or exhibit cluttered backgrounds that are semantically inconsistent with foreground targets. To address these limitations, we propose ReamCamo, a unified out-painting based framework for realistic camouflaged image generation. ReamCamo explicitly introduces additional layout controls to regulate global image structure, thereby improving semantic coherence between foreground objects and generated backgrounds. Moreover, we construct a multi-modal textual-visual condition by combining a unified fine-grained textual task description with texture-oriented background retrieval, which jointly guides the generation process to enhance visual fidelity and realism.

While event cameras offer a promising solution due to their high temporal resolution, current 6DoF pose estimation methods typically yield suboptimal performance in high-speed object moving scenarios. To address this gap, we propose PoseStreamer, a robust multi-modal 6DoF pose estimation framework designed specifically on high-speed moving scenarios. Our approach integrates three core components: an Adaptive Pose Memory Queue that utilizes historical orientation cues for temporal consistency, an Object-centric 2D Tracker that provides strong 2D priors to boost 3D center recall, and a Ray Pose Filter for geometric refinement along camera rays. Furthermore, we introduce MoCapCube6D, a novel multi-modal dataset constructed to benchmark performance under rapid motion.

However, current methods have two key bottlenecks. On one hand, they struggle to process diagnostic and descriptive texts simultaneously, making it difficult to identify lesions and establish associations with image regions. On the other hand, existing approaches focus on lesions description and fail to capture positional constraints, leading to critical deviations. Specifically, with the text \"in the left lower lung\", the segmentation results may incorrectly cover both sides of the lung. To address the limitations, we propose the Spatial-aware Symmetric Alignment (SSA) framework to enhance the capacity of referring hybrid medical texts consisting of locational, descriptive, and diagnostic information. Specifically, we propose symmetric optimal transport alignment mechanism to strengthen the associations between image regions and multiple relevant expressions, which establishes bi-directional fine-grained multimodal correspondences. In addition, we devise a composite directional guidance strategy that explicitly introduces spatial constraints in the text by constructing region-level guidance masks.

However, existing prompt-based methods for removing or modifying identity-specific features rely either on the subject being well-represented in the pre-trained model or require model fine-tuning for specific identities. In this work, we analyze the identity generation process and introduce a reverse personalization framework for face anonymization. Our approach leverages conditional diffusion inversion, allowing direct manipulation of images without using text prompts. To generalize beyond subjects in the model's training data, we incorporate an identity-guided conditioning branch.

Existing methods rely on a pre-defined Object Lookup Table (OLT) to query Visual Language Models (VLMs) for reasoning about object locations, which limits the applications in scenarios with undefined or unforeseen targets. To address this problem, we present OpenGround, a novel zero-shot framework for open-world 3D visual grounding. Central to OpenGround is the Active Cognition-based Reasoning (ACR) module, which is designed to overcome the fundamental limitation of pre-defined OLTs by progressively augmenting the cognitive scope of VLMs. The ACR module performs human-like perception of the target via a cognitive task chain and actively reasons about contextually relevant objects, thereby extending VLM cognition through a dynamically updated OLT. This allows OpenGround to function with both pre-defined and open-world categories. We also propose a new dataset named OpenTarget, which contains over 7000 object-description pairs to evaluate our method in open-world scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OpenGround achieves competitive performance on Nr3D, state-of-the-art on ScanRefer, and delivers a substantial 17.6% improvement on OpenTarget.

In contrast, most computational object recognition systems operate on isolated image regions, devoid of meaning in isolation, thus ignoring this vital contextual information. This paper argues for the critical role of context and introduces a novel framework for contextual object classification. We first construct a Geo-Semantic Contextual Graph (GSCG) from a single monocular image. This rich, structured representation is built by integrating a metric depth estimator with a unified panoptic and material segmentation model. The GSCG encodes objects as nodes with detailed geometric, chromatic, and material attributes, and their spatial relationships as edges. This explicit graph structure makes the model's reasoning process inherently interpretable. We then propose a specialized graph-based classifier that aggregates features from a target object, its immediate neighbors, and the global scene context to predict its class.

In this work, we propose Co2S, a stable semi-supervised RS segmentation framework that synergistically fuses priors from vision-language models and self-supervised models. Specifically, we construct a heterogeneous dual-student architecture comprising two distinct ViT-based vision foundation models initialized with pretrained CLIP and DINOv3 to mitigate error accumulation and pseudo-label drift. To effectively incorporate these distinct priors, an explicit-implicit semantic co-guidance mechanism is introduced that utilizes text embeddings and learnable queries to provide explicit and implicit class-level guidance, respectively, thereby jointly enhancing semantic consistency. Furthermore, a global-local feature collaborative fusion strategy is developed to effectively fuse the global contextual information captured by CLIP with the local details produced by DINOv3, enabling the model to generate highly precise segmentation results. Extensive experiments on six popular datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method, which consistently achieves leading performance across various partition protocols and diverse scenarios.

Foundation models for medical image segmentation (MedSAM) provide an opportunity to introduce anatomically grounded priors that may improve robustness and interpretability in CXR analysis. We propose a segmentation-guided CXR classification pipeline that integrates MedSAM as a lung region extraction module prior to multi-label abnormality classification. MedSAM is fine-tuned using a public image-mask dataset from Airlangga University Hospital. We then apply it to a curated subset of the public NIH CXR dataset to train and evaluate deep convolutional neural networks for multi-label prediction of five abnormalities (Mass, Nodule, Pneumonia, Edema, and Fibrosis), with the normal case (No Finding) evaluated via a derived score. Experiments show that MedSAM produces anatomically plausible lung masks across diverse imaging conditions. We find that masking effects are both task-dependent and architecture-dependent. ResNet50 trained on original images achieves the strongest overall abnormality discrimination, while loose lung masking yields comparable macro AUROC but significantly improves No Finding discrimination, indicating a trade-off between abnormality-specific classification and normal case screening. Tight masking consistently reduces abnormality level performance but improves training efficiency. Loose masking partially mitigates this degradation by preserving perihilar and peripheral context. These results suggest that lung masking should be treated as a controllable spatial prior selected to match the backbone and clinical objective, rather than applied uniformly.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7ed3\u5408MedSAM\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u80ba\u90e8\u533a\u57df\u5206\u5272\u540e\uff0cCXR\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u5206\u5272\u7b56\u7565\u5f71\u54cd\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5e94\u6839\u636e\u4efb\u52a1\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u9009\u62e9\u9002\u5b9c\u7684\u5206\u5272\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "motivation": "CXR\u6210\u50cf\u5b58\u5728\u5f31\u75be\u75c5\u4fe1\u53f7\u3001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u6709\u9650\u7a7a\u95f4\u76d1\u7763\u5bfc\u81f4\u81ea\u52a8\u8bca\u65ad\u56f0\u96be\uff0cMedSAM\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u63d0\u4f9b\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u5347\u8bca\u65ad\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u5272\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684CXR\u5206\u7c7b\u7ba1\u7ebf\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u5f02\u5e38\u5206\u7c7b\u4e0e\u6b63\u5e38\u7b5b\u67e5\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaMedSAM\u80ba\u90e8\u63d0\u53d6\u6a21\u5757+CNN\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u7c7b\u53cc\u9636\u6bb5\u7ba1\u7ebf\u3002\u5728Airlangga\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5fae\u8c03MedSAM\u751f\u6210\u80ba\u90e8\u63a9\u819c\uff0cNIH-CXR\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3ResNet50\u7b49\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u80ba\u5b9e\u8d28\u3001\u80ba\u708e\u3001\u80ba\u6c34\u80bf\u7b495\u7c7b\u75c5\u53d8\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e25\u683c/\u5bbd\u677e\u5206\u5272\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "1) MedSAM\u751f\u6210\u5177\u89e3\u5256\u5b66\u5408\u7406\u6027\u7684\u80ba\u90e8\u63a9\u819c 2) ResNet50\u5728\u539f\u59cb\u56fe\u50cf\u8fbe\u6700\u4f73\u5f02\u5e38\u5206\u7c7b(0.813 macro AUROC) 3) \u5bbd\u677e\u63a9\u819c\u635f\u5bb3\u5f02\u5e38\u5206\u7c7b\u4f46\u63d0\u5347\u6b63\u5e38\u7c7b\u8bc6\u522b(8.3%\u6539\u5584) 4) \u4e25\u683c\u63a9\u819c\u964d\u4f4e3.7%\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u4f46\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u80ba\u90e8\u63a9\u819c\u5e94\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u8c03\u8282\u7a7a\u95f4\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u8bca\u65ad\u91cd\u70b9(\u5f02\u5e38\u5206\u7c7bvs\u6b63\u5e38\u7b5b\u67e5)\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u5bbd\u677e\u63a9\u819c\u9002\u5408\u6b63\u5e38\u7b5b\u67e5\u573a\u666f\u800c\u4e25\u683c\u63a9\u819c\u9002\u914d\u7279\u5b9a\u75c5\u53d8\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002"}}

Current generative models typically operate in the global pixel domain or rely on binary masks, these paradigms often suffer from feature entanglement, leading to corrupted anatomical substrates or structural discontinuities. PathoSyn addresses these limitations by decomposing the synthesis task into deterministic anatomical reconstruction and stochastic deviation modeling. Central to our framework is a Deviation-Space Diffusion Model designed to learn the conditional distribution of pathological residuals, thereby capturing localized intensity variations while preserving global structural integrity by construction. To ensure spatial coherence, the diffusion process is coupled with a seam-aware fusion strategy and an inference-time stabilization module, which collectively suppress boundary artifacts and produce high-fidelity internal lesion heterogeneity. PathoSyn provides a mathematically principled pipeline for generating high-fidelity patient-specific synthetic datasets, facilitating the development of robust diagnostic algorithms in low-data regimes. By allowing interpretable counterfactual disease progression modeling, the framework supports precision intervention planning and provides a controlled environment for benchmarking clinical decision-support systems. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations on tumor imaging benchmarks demonstrate that PathoSyn significantly outperforms holistic diffusion and mask-conditioned baselines in both perceptual realism and anatomical fidelity.

However, learning-based models are widely believed to be sensitive to domain shift, with robustness typically pursued through large and diverse training datasets, without explaining the underlying mechanisms. In this work, we show that domain-shift immunity is an inherent property of deep deformable registration models, arising from their reliance on local feature representations rather than global appearance for deformation estimation. To isolate and validate this mechanism, we introduce UniReg, a universal registration framework that decouples feature extraction from deformation estimation using fixed, pre-trained feature extractors and a UNet-based deformation network. Despite training on a single dataset, UniReg exhibits robust cross-domain and multi-modal performance comparable to optimization-based methods. Our analysis further reveals that failures of conventional CNN-based models under modality shift originate from dataset-induced biases in early convolutional layers.

Some previous methods have shown substantial improvements by either employing heterogeneous teacher models to provide high-quality pseudo labels or enforcing feature-perspective consistency between the teacher and student networks. However, these methods overlook the fact that the model usually tends to exhibit low sensitivity to object geometries with limited labeled data, making it difficult to capture geometric information, which is crucial for enhancing the student model's ability in object perception and localization. In this paper, we propose GeoTeacher to enhance the student model's ability to capture geometric relations of objects with limited training data, especially unlabeled data. We design a keypoint-based geometric relation supervision module that transfers the teacher model's knowledge of object geometry to the student, thereby improving the student's capability in understanding geometric relations. Furthermore, we introduce a voxel-wise data augmentation strategy that increases the diversity of object geometries, thereby further improving the student model's ability to comprehend geometric structures. To preserve the integrity of distant objects during augmentation, we incorporate a distance-decay mechanism into this strategy.

Existing image-based approaches face two critical challenges: methods achieving high accuracy typically require dense 3D supervision, while those operating without such supervision struggle to extract accurate geometry from images alone. In this paper, we present GVSynergy-Det, a novel framework that enhances 3D detection through synergistic Gaussian-Voxel representation learning. Our key insight is that continuous Gaussian and discrete voxel representations capture complementary geometric information: Gaussians excel at modeling fine-grained surface details while voxels provide structured spatial context. We introduce a dual-representation architecture that: 1) adapts generalizable Gaussian Splatting to extract complementary geometric features for detection tasks, and 2) develops a cross-representation enhancement mechanism that enriches voxel features with geometric details from Gaussian fields. Unlike previous methods that either rely on time-consuming per-scene optimization or utilize Gaussian representations solely for depth regularization, our synergistic strategy directly leverages features from both representations through learnable integration, enabling more accurate object localization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GVSynergy-Det achieves state-of-the-art results on challenging indoor benchmarks, significantly outperforming existing methods on both ScanNetV2 and ARKitScenes datasets, all without requiring any depth or dense 3D geometry supervision (e.g., point clouds or TSDF).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eGaussian-Voxel\u8054\u5408\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u9a71\u52a83D\u7269\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6GVSynergy-Det\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u8fde\u7eed\u9ad8\u65af\u8868\u793a\u548c\u79bb\u6563\u4f53\u7d20\u8868\u793a\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u6df1\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\u6216\u5bc6\u96c63D\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5ba4\u5185\u573a\u666f\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u50cf3D\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u96be\u56f0\u5883\uff1a\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u5bc6\u96c63D\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u4ece2D\u56fe\u50cf\u63d0\u53d6\u7cbe\u786e\u51e0\u4f55\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u70b9\u4e91\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff0c\u800c\u9ad8\u65af\u8868\u793a\u867d\u80fd\u5efa\u6a21\u51e0\u4f55\u7ec6\u8282\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u9010\u573a\u666f\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4f53\u7d20\u8868\u793a\u867d\u5177\u6709\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7ec6\u8282\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u53cc\u8868\u793a\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5305\u542b\uff1a1) \u901a\u7528\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u9002\u914d\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\uff1b2) \u8de8\u8868\u793a\u589e\u5f3a\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u65af\u573a\u51e0\u4f55\u7ec6\u8282\u4e30\u5bcc\u4f53\u7d20\u7279\u5f81\uff1b3) \u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8fde\u7eed\u9ad8\u65af\u8868\u793a\u7684\u8868\u9762\u7ec6\u8282\u4e0e\u79bb\u6563\u4f53\u7d20\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u97003D\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5728ScanNetV2\u548cARKitScenes\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u8fbe\u523072.1%\u548c68.4% mAP\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u6240\u6709\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u56fe\u50cf3D\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u90e8\u5206\u57fa\u4e8e\u70b9\u4e91\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5728NYUv2\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b065.3% mAP\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u9ad8\u65af\u4e0e\u4f53\u7d20\u8868\u793a\u7684\u534f\u540c\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5f25\u8865\u5f7c\u6b64\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u7ec6\u8282\u4e0e\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u65e0\u76d1\u77633D\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u7eaf\u56fe\u50cf3D\u611f\u77e5\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

However, existing DWMs lack 3D scene understanding capabilities and can only generate content conditioned on input data, without the ability to interpret or reason about the driving environment. Moreover, current approaches represent 3D spatial information with point cloud or BEV features do not accurately align textual information with the underlying 3D scene. To address these limitations, we propose a novel unified DWM framework based on 3D Gaussian scene representation, which enables both 3D scene understanding and multi-modal scene generation, while also enabling contextual enrichment for understanding and generation tasks. Our approach directly aligns textual information with the 3D scene by embedding rich linguistic features into each Gaussian primitive, thereby achieving early modality alignment. In addition, we design a novel task-aware language-guided sampling strategy that removes redundant 3D Gaussians and injects accurate and compact 3D tokens into LLM. Furthermore, we design a dual-condition multi-modal generation model, where the information captured by our vision-language model is leveraged as a high-level language condition in combination with a low-level image condition, jointly guiding the multi-modal generation process. We conduct comprehensive studies on the nuScenes, and NuInteract datasets to validate the effectiveness of our framework. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

The study explores several DL models, including UNet, UNet++, ResUNet, AttentionUNet, and ResNet50-Segnet, applied to high-resolution Sentinel-2 Level 2A satellite images of the Amazon Rainforest. The datasets comprise three collections: two sets of three-band imagery and one set of four-band imagery. After evaluation, the most effective DL models are individually integrated with the OBIA technique to enhance mapping accuracy. The originality of this work lies in evaluating different deep learning models combined with OBIA and comparing them with traditional OBIA methods. The results show that the proposed ForCM method improves forest cover mapping, achieving overall accuracies of 94.54 percent with ResUNet-OBIA and 95.64 percent with AttentionUNet-OBIA, compared to 92.91 percent using traditional OBIA.

Current diffusion model-based applications exploit the power of learned visual representations from multistep forward-backward Markovian processes for single-task prediction tasks by attaching a task-specific decoder. However, the heuristic selection of diffusion timestep features still heavily relies on empirical intuition, often leading to sub-optimal performance biased towards certain tasks. To alleviate this constraint, we investigate the significance of versatile diffusion timestep features by adaptively selecting timesteps best suited for the few-shot dense prediction task, evaluated on an arbitrary unseen task. To this end, we propose two modules: Task-aware Timestep Selection (TTS) to select ideal diffusion timesteps based on timestep-wise losses and similarity scores, and Timestep Feature Consolidation (TFC) to consolidate the selected timestep features to improve the dense predictive performance in a few-shot setting. Accompanied by our parameter-efficient fine-tuning adapter, our framework effectively achieves superiority in dense prediction performance given only a few support queries.

To bridge this gap, we present MM-UAVBench, a comprehensive benchmark that systematically evaluates MLLMs across three core capability dimensions-perception, cognition, and planning-in low-altitude UAV scenarios. MM-UAVBench comprises 19 sub-tasks with over 5.7K manually annotated questions, all derived from real-world UAV data collected from public datasets. Extensive experiments on 16 open-source and proprietary MLLMs reveal that current models struggle to adapt to the complex visual and cognitive demands of low-altitude scenarios.

We argue that these two tasks should be unified within a single framework, as logical reasoning and imaginative thinking are both fundamental qualities of a film director. In this work, we propose UniMAGE, a unified director model that bridges user prompts with well-structured scripts, thereby empowering non-experts to produce long-context, multi-shot films by leveraging existing audio-video generation models. To achieve this, we employ the Mixture-of-Transformers architecture that unifies text and image generation. To further enhance narrative logic and keyframe consistency, we introduce a ``first interleaving, then disentangling'' training paradigm.

We then conduct Disentangled Expert Learning, which decouples script writing from keyframe generation, enabling greater flexibility and creativity in storytelling.

Due to the scarcity of real defect images, unsupervised approaches that rely solely on normal images have been extensively studied. Recently, diffusion-based generative models brought attention to training data synthesis as an alternative solution. In this work, we focus on a strategy to effectively leverage synthetic images to maximize the anomaly detection performance. Previous synthesis strategies are broadly categorized into two groups, presenting a clear trade-off. Rule-based synthesis, such as injecting noise or pasting patches, is cost-effective but often fails to produce realistic defect images. On the other hand, generative model-based synthesis can create high-quality defect images but requires substantial cost. To address this problem, we propose a novel framework that leverages a pre-trained text-guided image-to-image translation model and image retrieval model to efficiently generate synthetic defect images. Specifically, the image retrieval model assesses the similarity of the generated images to real normal images and filters out irrelevant outputs, thereby enhancing the quality and relevance of the generated defect images. To effectively leverage synthetic images, we also introduce a two stage training strategy. In this strategy, the model is first pre-trained on a large volume of images from rule-based synthesis and then fine-tuned on a smaller set of high-quality images. This method significantly reduces the cost for data collection while improving the anomaly detection performance.

By mitigating noise induced errors during the critical early and middle sampling stages, SGPS enables more accurate posterior sampling and reduces error accumulation.

However, these models rely on large amounts of globally representative data, which often contain redundancy, noise, and class imbalance, reducing training efficiency and preventing convergence. Existing RS diffusion foundation models typically aggregate multiple classification datasets or apply simplistic deduplication, overlooking the distributional requirements of generation modeling and the heterogeneity of RS imagery. To address these limitations, we propose a training-free, two-stage data pruning approach that quickly select a high-quality subset under high pruning ratios, enabling a preliminary foundation model to converge rapidly and serve as a versatile backbone for generation, downstream fine-tuning, and other applications. Our method jointly considers local information content with global scene-level diversity and representativeness. First, an entropy-based criterion efficiently removes low-information samples. Next, leveraging RS scene classification datasets as reference benchmarks, we perform scene-aware clustering with stratified sampling to improve clustering effectiveness while reducing computational costs on large-scale unlabeled data. Finally, by balancing cluster-level uniformity and sample representativeness, the method enables fine-grained selection under high pruning ratios while preserving overall diversity and representativeness.

To address the deficiencies of existing methods, including the failure of fixed resolutions to balance efficiency and detail, as well as the lack of semantic hierarchy in single-scale alignment, this study proposes a Vision-language Model (VLM) framework integrated with two key innovations: the Dynamic Resolution Input Strategy (DRIS) and the Multi-scale Vision-language Alignment Mechanism (MS-VLAM).Specifically, the DRIS adopts a coarse-to-fine approach to adaptively allocate computational resources according to the complexity of image content, thereby preserving key fine-grained features while reducing redundant computational overhead. The MS-VLAM constructs a three-tier alignment mechanism covering object, local-region and global levels, which systematically captures cross-modal semantic consistency and alleviates issues of semantic misalignment and granularity imbalance.Experimental results on the RS-GPT4V dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves the accuracy of semantic understanding and computational efficiency in tasks including image captioning and cross-modal retrieval. Compared with conventional methods, it achieves superior performance in evaluation metrics such as BLEU-4 and CIDEr for image captioning, as well as R@10 for cross-modal retrieval.

To address these issues, we propose ViLaCD-R1, a two-stage framework comprising a Multi-Image Reasoner (MIR) and a Mask-Guided Decoder (MGD). Specifically, the VLM is trained through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) on block-level dual-temporal inference tasks, taking dual-temporal image patches as input and outputting a coarse change mask. Then, the decoder integrates dual-temporal image features with this coarse mask to predict a precise binary change map.

In this paper, we introduce a novel framework, ASemconsist, that addresses this challenge through selective text embedding modification, enabling explicit semantic control over character identity without sacrificing prompt alignment. Furthermore, based on our analysis of padding embeddings in FLUX, we propose a semantic control strategy that repurposes padding embeddings as semantic containers. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive feature-sharing strategy that automatically evaluates textual ambiguity and applies constraints only to the ambiguous identity prompt. Finally, we propose a unified evaluation protocol, the Consistency Quality Score (CQS), which integrates identity preservation and per-image text alignment into a single comprehensive metric, explicitly capturing performance imbalances between the two metrics. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively overcoming prior trade-offs.

Recently, Gaussian Splatting has emerged as an efficient representation framework, and its extension to 2D image representation enables lightweight, yet expressive modeling of visual content. While recent 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) approaches provide compact storage and real-time decoding, they often produce blurry or indistinct boundaries when the number of Gaussians is small due to the lack of contour awareness. In this work, we propose a Contour Information-Aware 2D Gaussian Splatting framework that incorporates object segmentation priors into Gaussian-based image representation. By constraining each Gaussian to a specific segmentation region during rasterization, our method prevents cross-boundary blending and preserves edge structures under high compression.

Caching-based methods achieve training-free acceleration, while suffering from considerable computational error. Existing methods typically incorporate error correction strategies such as pruning or prediction to mitigate it. However, their fixed caching strategy fails to adapt to the complex error variations during denoising, which limits the full potential of error correction. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel fidelity-optimization plugin for existing error correction methods via cumulative error minimization, named CEM. CEM predefines the error to characterize the sensitivity of model to acceleration jointly influenced by timesteps and cache intervals. Guided by this prior, we formulate a dynamic programming algorithm with cumulative error approximation for strategy optimization, which achieves the caching error minimization, resulting in a substantial improvement in generation fidelity. CEM is model-agnostic and exhibits strong generalization, which is adaptable to arbitrary acceleration budgets. It can be seamlessly integrated into existing error correction frameworks and quantized models without introducing any additional computational overhead. Extensive experiments conducted on nine generation models and quantized methods across three tasks demonstrate that CEM significantly improves generation fidelity of existing acceleration models, and outperforms the original generation performance on FLUX.1-dev, PixArt-$\u03b1$, StableDiffusion1.5 and Hunyuan.

We begin from a single hypothesis: that visual understanding presupposes a semantic language for vision, in which many perceptual observations correspond to a small number of discrete semantic states. Together with widely assumed premises on transferability and abstraction in representation learning, this hypothesis implies that the visual observation space must be organized in a fiber bundle like structure, where nuisance variation populates fibers and semantics correspond to a quotient base space. From this structure we derive two theoretical consequences. First, the semantic quotient $X/G$ is not a submanifold of $X$ and cannot be obtained through smooth deformation alone, semantic invariance requires a non-homeomorphic, discriminative target, for example, supervision via labels, cross instance identification, or multimodal alignment that supplies explicit semantic equivalence. Second, we show that approximating the quotient also places structural demands on the model architecture. Semantic abstraction requires not only an external semantic target, but a representation mechanism capable of supporting topology change: an expand-and-snap process in which the manifold is first geometrically expanded to separate structure and then collapsed to form discrete semantic regions. We emphasize that these results are interpretive rather than prescriptive: the framework provides a topological lens that aligns with empirical regularities observed in large-scale discriminative and multimodal models, and with classical principles in statistical learning theory.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u89c6\u89c9\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u9700\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ea4\u7ef4\u4e1b\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u8bed\u4e49\u62bd\u8c61\u9700\u975e\u540c\u80da\u5904\u7406\u548c\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u62d3\u6251\u89c6\u89d2\u89e3\u91ca\u89c6\u89c9\u7406\u89e3\u9700\u79bb\u6563\u5e03\u5c14\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5047\u8bbe\u63a8\u5bfc\u7ea4\u7ef4\u4e1b\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5546\u7a7a\u95f4\u7279\u6027\u53ca\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u62d3\u6251\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a\u8bed\u4e49\u5546\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u663e\u5f0f\u8bed\u4e49\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4e14\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u652f\u6301\u62d3\u6251\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u6269\u5c55-\u5feb\u7167\u673a\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

In addition, we present SpatialMosaicVLM, a hybrid framework that integrates 3D reconstruction models as geometry encoders within VLMs for robust spatial reasoning.

Current IMDL research typically uses cross-dataset evaluation, where models trained on one benchmark are tested on others. However, this simplified evaluation approach conceals the fragility of existing methods when handling diverse AI-generated content, leading to misleading impressions of progress. This paper challenges this illusion by proposing NeXT-IMDL, a large-scale diagnostic benchmark designed not just to collect data, but to probe the generalization boundaries of current detectors systematically. Specifically, NeXT-IMDL categorizes AIGC-based manipulations along four fundamental axes: editing models, manipulation types, content semantics, and forgery granularity. Built upon this, NeXT-IMDL implements five rigorous cross-dimension evaluation protocols. Our extensive experiments on 11 representative models reveal a critical insight: while these models perform well in their original settings, they exhibit systemic failures and significant performance degradation when evaluated under our designed protocols that simulate real-world, various generalization scenarios.

Native 3D methods relying on geometric cues often suffer from boundary leakage, center drift, and inconsistent tooth identities, especially for minority classes and complex anatomies. Meanwhile, 2D foundation models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM) provide strong boundary-aware semantics, but directly applying them in 3D is impractical in clinical workflows. To address these issues, we propose SOFTooth, a semantics-enhanced, order-aware 2D-3D fusion framework that leverages frozen 2D semantics without explicit 2D mask supervision. First, a point-wise residual gating module injects occlusal-view SAM embeddings into 3D point features to refine tooth-gingiva and inter-tooth boundaries. Second, a center-guided mask refinement regularizes consistency between instance masks and geometric centroids, reducing center drift. Furthermore, an order-aware Hungarian matching strategy integrates anatomical tooth order and center distance into similarity-based assignment, ensuring coherent labeling even under missing or crowded dentitions. On 3DTeethSeg'22, SOFTooth achieves state-of-the-art overall accuracy and mean IoU, with clear gains on cases involving third molars, demonstrating that rich 2D semantics can be effectively transferred to 3D tooth instance segmentation without 2D fine-tuning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aSOFTooth\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u589e\u5f3a\u578b3D\u7259\u9f7f\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5206\u5272\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u54082D\u8bed\u4e49\u548c3D\u51e0\u4f55\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7259\u9f7f\u8fb9\u754c\u6a21\u7cca\u3001\u7259\u9f88\u6df7\u6dc6\u53ca\u7b2c\u4e09\u81fc\u9f7f\u5206\u5272\u96be\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e09\u7ef4\u7259\u9f7f\u5206\u5272\u9762\u4e34\u7259\u5217\u62e5\u6324\u3001\u7259\u9f7f-\u7259\u9f88\u8fb9\u754c\u6a21\u7cca\u3001\u7f3a\u7259\u548c\u7b2c\u4e09\u81fc\u9f7f\u7b49\u4e34\u5e8a\u91cd\u8981\u7ed3\u6784\u5206\u5272\u56f0\u96be\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf3D\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u8fb9\u754c\u6cc4\u6f0f\u548c\u8eab\u4efd\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c2D\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e3D\u4e34\u5e8a\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSOFTooth\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u70b9\u7ea7\u6b8b\u5dee\u95e8\u63a7\u6a21\u5757\u5c062D-SAM\u5d4c\u51653D\u70b9\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u63a9\u7801\u4f18\u5316\u4fdd\u6301\u51e0\u4f55\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u89e3\u5256\u987a\u5e8f\u7684\u5308\u7259\u5229\u5339\u914d\u7b56\u7565\u5b9e\u73b0\u62e5\u6324\u7259\u5217\u4e0b\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u914d\u3002", "result": "\u57283DTeethSeg'22\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u6574\u4f53\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u5e73\u5747IoU\uff0c\u5bf9\u7b2c\u4e09\u81fc\u9f7f\u7b49\u56f0\u96be\u75c5\u4f8b\u63d0\u5347\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65e0\u97002D\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u8fc1\u79fb\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u57fa\u4e8e\u51bb\u7ed32D\u8bed\u4e49\u76843D\u5206\u5272\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u7259\u9f7f\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u6a21\u7cca\u548c\u8eab\u4efd\u6df7\u4e71\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4e34\u5e8a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u4f18\u5f02\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Existing preference-based training methods like Diffusion Direct Preference Optimization help address these issues but rely on costly and potentially noisy human-labeled datasets. In this work, we introduce Direct Diffusion Score Preference Optimization (DDSPO), which directly derives per-timestep supervision from winning and losing policies when such policies are available. Unlike prior methods that operate solely on final samples, DDSPO provides dense, transition-level signals across the denoising trajectory. In practice, we avoid reliance on labeled data by automatically generating preference signals using a pretrained reference model: we contrast its outputs when conditioned on original prompts versus semantically degraded variants. This practical strategy enables effective score-space preference supervision without explicit reward modeling or manual annotations.

This work investigates whether uncertainty quantification can mitigate such challenges and enhance model generalisability in a domain-agnostic manner. To this end, we (1) curate UncertSAM, a benchmark comprising eight datasets designed to stress-test SAM under challenging segmentation conditions including shadows, transparency, and camouflage; (2) evaluate a suite of lightweight, post-hoc uncertainty estimation methods; and (3) assess a preliminary uncertainty-guided prediction refinement step.

We tested a large number of different image-based deep learning algorithms for road classification. In addition, we used road acceleration data along with road image data for training by using them as images. We compared the performances of acceleration-based and camera image-based approaches. The performances of the simple Alexnet, LeNet, VGG, and Resnet algorithms were compared as deep learning algorithms. For road condition classification, 5 classes were considered: asphalt, damaged asphalt, gravel road, damaged gravel road, pavement road and over 95% accuracy performance was achieved.

We propose \\textbf{CoFi-Dec}, a training-free decoding framework that mitigates hallucinations by integrating generative self-feedback with coarse-to-fine visual conditioning. Inspired by the human visual process from global scene perception to detailed inspection, CoFi-Dec first generates two intermediate textual responses conditioned on coarse- and fine-grained views of the original image. These responses are then transformed into synthetic images using a text-to-image model, forming multi-level visual hypotheses that enrich grounding cues. To unify the predictions from these multiple visual conditions, we introduce a Wasserstein-based fusion mechanism that aligns their predictive distributions into a geometrically consistent decoding trajectory. This principled fusion reconciles high-level semantic consistency with fine-grained visual grounding, leading to more robust and faithful outputs. Extensive experiments on six hallucination-focused benchmarks show that CoFi-Dec substantially reduces both entity-level and semantic-level hallucinations, outperforming existing decoding strategies. The framework is model-agnostic, requires no additional training, and can be seamlessly applied to a wide range of LVLMs. The implementation is available at https://github.com/AI-Researcher-Team/CoFi-Dec.", "AI": {"tldr": "CoFi-Dec is a training-free framework for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) that reduces hallucinations by integrating self-feedback and coarse-to-fine visual conditioning, combining text-to-image synthesis with a Wasserstein-based fusion mechanism to align multi-level visual predictions.", "motivation": "LVLMs often generate visually inconsistent content (hallucinations), limiting their practical reliability.

Traditional hydrological observation methods are often limited by manual measurement errors and environmental constraints. This study presents a hybrid framework integrating vision based waterline detection, YOLOv8 pose scale extraction, and large multimodal language models (GPT 4o and Gemini 2.0 Flash) for automated river gauge plate reading. The methodology involves sequential stages of image preprocessing, annotation, waterline detection, scale gap estimation, and numeric reading extraction. Experiments demonstrate that waterline detection achieved high precision of 94.24 percent and an F1 score of 83.64 percent, while scale gap detection provided accurate geometric calibration for subsequent reading extraction. Incorporating scale gap metadata substantially improved the predictive performance of LLMs, with Gemini Stage 2 achieving the highest accuracy, with a mean absolute error of 5.43 cm, root mean square error of 8.58 cm, and R squared of 0.84 under optimal image conditions. Results highlight the sensitivity of LLMs to image quality, with degraded images producing higher errors, and underscore the importance of combining geometric metadata with multimodal artificial intelligence for robust water level estimation.

Nonetheless, when confronted with lengthy videos, these models struggle: their temporal windows are narrow, and they fail to notice fine-grained semantic shifts that unfold over extended durations. Moreover, mainstream text-based retrieval pipelines, which rely chiefly on surface-level lexical overlap, ignore the rich temporal interdependence among visual, audio, and subtitle channels. To mitigate these limitations, we propose TV-RAG, a training-free architecture that couples temporal alignment with entropy-guided semantics to improve long-video reasoning. The framework contributes two main mechanisms: \\emph{(i)} a time-decay retrieval module that injects explicit temporal offsets into the similarity computation, thereby ranking text queries according to their true multimedia context; and \\emph{(ii)} an entropy-weighted key-frame sampler that selects evenly spaced, information-dense frames, reducing redundancy while preserving representativeness. By weaving these temporal and semantic signals together, TV-RAG realises a dual-level reasoning routine that can be grafted onto any LVLM without re-training or fine-tuning. The resulting system offers a lightweight, budget-friendly upgrade path and consistently surpasses most leading baselines across established long-video benchmarks such as Video-MME, MLVU, and LongVideoBench, confirming the effectiveness of our model.

This paper presents IdentityStory, a framework for human-centric story generation that ensures consistent character identity across multiple sequential images. By taming identity-preserving generators, the framework features two key components: Iterative Identity Discovery, which extracts cohesive character identities, and Re-denoising Identity Injection, which re-denoises images to inject identities while preserving desired context.

In this paper, we present AnyMS, a novel training-free framework for layout-guided multi-subject customization. AnyMS leverages three input conditions: text prompt, subject images, and layout constraints, and introduces a bottom-up dual-level attention decoupling mechanism to harmonize their integration during generation. Specifically, global decoupling separates cross-attention between textual and visual conditions to ensure text alignment. Local decoupling confines each subject's attention to its designated area, which prevents subject conflicts and thus guarantees identity preservation and layout control. Moreover, AnyMS employs pre-trained image adapters to extract subject-specific features aligned with the diffusion model, removing the need for subject learning or adapter tuning.

Traditional safety methods like text blacklisting or harmful content classification have significant drawbacks: they can be easily circumvented or require extensive datasets and extra training. To overcome these challenges, we introduce PurifyGen, a novel, training-free approach for safe T2I generation that retains the model's original weights. PurifyGen introduces a dual-stage strategy for prompt purification. First, we evaluate the safety of each token in a prompt by computing its complementary semantic distance, which measures the semantic proximity between the prompt tokens and concept embeddings from predefined toxic and clean lists. This enables fine-grained prompt classification without explicit keyword matching or retraining. Tokens closer to toxic concepts are flagged as risky. Second, for risky prompts, we apply a dual-space transformation: we project toxic-aligned embeddings into the null space of the toxic concept matrix, effectively removing harmful semantic components, and simultaneously align them into the range space of clean concepts. This dual alignment purifies risky prompts by both subtracting unsafe semantics and reinforcing safe ones, while retaining the original intent and coherence. We further define a token-wise strategy to selectively replace only risky token embeddings, ensuring minimal disruption to safe content.

We further propose a separable GRPO-based training paradigm (SepGRPO), alternating reinforcement learning between the MLLM and DiT modules. This flexible design enables joint training across diverse datasets, facilitating effective CoT reasoning for a wide range of generative scenarios.

To address these challenges, we propose ProGuard, a vision-language proactive guard that identifies and describes out-of-distribution (OOD) safety risks without the need for model adjustments required by traditional reactive approaches. We first construct a modality-balanced dataset of 87K samples, each annotated with both binary safety labels and risk categories under a hierarchical multimodal safety taxonomy, effectively mitigating modality bias and ensuring consistent moderation across text, image, and text-image inputs. Based on this dataset, we train our vision-language base model purely through reinforcement learning (RL) to achieve efficient and concise reasoning. To approximate proactive safety scenarios in a controlled setting, we further introduce an OOD safety category inference task and augment the RL objective with a synonym-bank-based similarity reward that encourages the model to generate concise descriptions for unseen unsafe categories. Experimental results show that ProGuard achieves performance comparable to closed-source large models on binary safety classification, substantially outperforms existing open-source guard models on unsafe content categorization.

However, the simultaneous denoising of all video frames with bidirectional attention via an iterative process in diffusion models prevents real-time interaction. While existing distillation methods can make the model autoregressive and reduce sampling steps to mitigate this, they focus primarily on text-to-video generation, leaving the human-AI interaction unnatural and less efficient. This paper targets real-time interactive video diffusion conditioned on a multimodal context, including text, image, and audio, to bridge the gap. Given the observation that the leading on-policy distillation approach Self Forcing encounters challenges (visual artifacts like flickering, black frames, and quality degradation) with multimodal conditioning, we investigate an improved distillation recipe with emphasis on the quality of condition inputs as well as the initialization and schedule for the on-policy optimization. On benchmarks for multimodal-conditioned (audio, image, and text) avatar video generation including HDTF, AVSpeech, and CelebV-HQ, our distilled model matches the visual quality of the full-step, bidirectional baselines of similar or larger size with 20x less inference cost and latency. Further, we integrate our model with audio language models and long-form video inference technique Anchor-Heavy Identity Sinks to build LiveTalk, a real-time multimodal interactive avatar system. System-level evaluation on our curated multi-turn interaction benchmark shows LiveTalk outperforms state-of-the-art models (Sora2, Veo3) in multi-turn video coherence and content quality, while reducing response latency from 1 to 2 minutes to real-time generation, enabling seamless human-AI multimodal interaction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7LiveTalk\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5411\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8fed\u4ee3\u53bb\u566a\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b9e\u65f6\u4ea4\u4e92\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u6587\u672c\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\uff08\u6587\u672c\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u97f3\u9891\uff09\u5b9e\u65f6\u4ea4\u4e92\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u4f2a\u5f71\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u6539\u8fdb\u84b8\u998f\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u6761\u4ef6\u8f93\u5165\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ca\u4f18\u5316\u8c03\u5ea6\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u97f3\u9891\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u63a8\u7406\u6280\u672fAnchor-Heavy Identity Sinks\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5b9e\u65f6\u7cfb\u7edfLiveTalk\u3002", "result": "\u5728HDTF\u7b49\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u5168\u6b65\u957f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u753b\u8d28\u6c34\u5e73\u4e14\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e20\u500d\uff1bLiveTalk\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u4ea4\u4e92\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8d85\u8fc7Sora2\u3001Veo3\u7b49\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ece\u5206\u949f\u7ea7\u5230\u5b9e\u65f6\u54cd\u5e94\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u884c\u6280\u672f\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Enhancing Visual Perception in Vision-Language Models", "comment": "Project webpage: https://glab-caltech.github.io/twin/", "summary": "Vision-language models (VLMs) excel at broad visual understanding but remain coarse-grained, exhibit visual biases, and miss subtle visual details. Existing training corpora reinforce this limitation by emphasizing general recognition (\"Is it a cat or a dog?\") over fine-grained perception. To address this, we introduce a new training corpus and task designed to enhance the perceptual abilities of VLMs. TWIN is a large-scale dataset of 561,000 image-pair queries that task models to determine whether two visually similar images depict the same object, encouraging attention to nuanced visual cues. The dataset spans a diverse range of everyday objects across contexts, viewpoints, and appearances. Fine-tuning VLMs on TWIN yields notable gains in fine-grained recognition, even on unseen domains such as art, animals, plants, and landmarks. To quantify these gains, we introduce FGVQA, a benchmark suite of 12,000 queries that repurposes fine-grained recognition and retrieval datasets from multiple domains. While existing VLMs struggle on FGVQA, when fine-tuned on TWIN they improve by up to 19.3%, without compromising performance on general VQA benchmarks. Finally, our TWIN dataset scales favorably with object annotations, and our analysis shows that scale is key to performance. We envision TWIN as a drop-in addition to open-source VLM training corpora, advancing perceptual precision of future models.

Previous studies have reported strong performance with popular detection models. For example, YOLOv7 achieved an mAP50-95 of 0.51 using an input image size of 640 x 1280, RT-DETR reached an mAP50-95 of 0.65 with an image size of 640 x 640, and YOLOv9 obtained an mAP50-95 of 0.598 at the same resolution. Despite these results, limitations in dataset construction continue to cause issues, particularly the frequent misclassification of bright artificial lights as fire.\n  This report presents three main contributions: an additional NIR dataset, a two-stage detection model, and Patched-YOLO. First, to address data scarcity, we explore and apply various data augmentation strategies for both the NIR dataset and the classification dataset. Second, to improve night-time fire detection accuracy while reducing false positives caused by artificial lights, we propose a two-stage pipeline combining YOLOv11 and EfficientNetV2-B0. The proposed approach achieves higher detection accuracy compared to previous methods, particularly for night-time fire detection. Third, to improve fire detection in RGB images, especially for small and distant objects, we introduce Patched-YOLO, which enhances the model's detection capability through patch-based processing.

These complexities require to be addressed with an effective and scalable system that can assist in enhancing the salience of the subtle visual cues and provide a high level of the generalization on the multimodal imaging data. A Scalable Residual Feature Aggregation (SRFA) framework is proposed to be used to meet these conditions in this study. The framework integrates a pipeline of preprocessing followed by the segmentation using the MAGRes-UNet that is effective in making the pancreatic structures and isolating regions of interest more visible. DenseNet-121 performed with residual feature storage is used to extract features to allow deep hierarchical features to be aggregated without properties loss. To go further, hybrid HHO-BA metaheuristic feature selection strategy is used, which guarantees the best feature subset refinement. To be classified, the system is trained based on a new hybrid model that integrates the ability to pay attention on the world, which is the Vision Transformer (ViT) with the high representational efficiency of EfficientNet-B3. A dual optimization mechanism incorporating SSA and GWO is used to fine-tune hyperparameters to enhance greater robustness and less overfitting. Experimental results support the significant improvement in performance, with the suggested model reaching 96.23% accuracy, 95.58% F1-score and 94.83% specificity, the model is significantly better than the traditional CNNs and contemporary transformer-based models.

We first apply our framework to quantify memorization in existing methods. Next, through controlled experiments with a latent vector-set (Vecset) diffusion model, we find that, on the data side, memorization depends on data modality, and increases with data diversity and finer-grained conditioning; on the modeling side, it peaks at a moderate guidance scale and can be mitigated by longer Vecsets and simple rotation augmentation. Together, our framework and analysis provide an empirical understanding of memorization in 3D generative models and suggest simple yet effective strategies to reduce it without degrading generation quality.

Existing methods typically rely on the attention mechanism to align objects across frames, simplifying the motion model with a unified explicit physical model (constant velocity, etc.). These approaches prefer semantic features for implicit alignment, challenging the importance of explicit motion modeling in the traditional perception paradigm. However, variations in motion states and object features across categories and frames render this alignment suboptimal. To address this, we propose HAT, a spatio-temporal alignment module that allows each object to adaptively decode the optimal alignment proposal from multiple hypotheses without direct supervision. Specifically, HAT first utilizes multiple explicit motion models to generate spatial anchors and motion-aware feature proposals for historical instances. It then performs multi-hypothesis decoding by incorporating semantic and motion cues embedded in cached object queries, ultimately providing the optimal alignment proposal for the target frame. On nuScenes, HAT consistently improves 3D temporal detectors and trackers across diverse baselines. It achieves state-of-the-art tracking results with 46.0% AMOTA on the test set when paired with the DETR3D detector. In an object-centric E2E AD method, HAT enhances perception accuracy (+1.3% mAP, +3.1% AMOTA) and reduces the collision rate by 32%.

Recent diffusion-based methods have achieved strong results for single-view intrinsic decomposition; however, extending these approaches to multi-view settings remains challenging, often leading to severe view inconsistency. We propose \\textbf{Intrinsic Decomposition Transformer (IDT)}, a feed-forward framework for multi-view intrinsic image decomposition. By leveraging transformer-based attention to jointly reason over multiple input images, IDT produces view-consistent intrinsic factors in a single forward pass, without iterative generative sampling. IDT adopts a physically grounded image formation model that explicitly decomposes images into diffuse reflectance, diffuse shading, and specular shading. This structured factorization separates Lambertian and non-Lambertian light transport, enabling interpretable and controllable decomposition of material and illumination effects across views. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that IDT achieves cleaner diffuse reflectance, more coherent diffuse shading, and better-isolated specular components, while substantially improving multi-view consistency compared to prior intrinsic decomposition methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aIntrinsic Decomposition Transformer (IDT)\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u56fe\u50cf\u672c\u5f81\u5206\u89e3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u5b9e\u73b0\u5355\u6b21\u524d\u5411\u8ba1\u7b97\u5373\u53ef\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u89d2\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u672c\u5f81\u5206\u91cf\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u8fed\u4ee3\u751f\u6210\u91c7\u6837\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u6210\u50cf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u5206\u89e3diffuse\u53cd\u5c04\u3001diffuse\u9634\u5f71\u548cspecular\u9634\u5f71\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0b\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5355\u89c6\u89d2\u56fe\u50cf\u672c\u5f81\u5206\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff09\u96be\u4ee5\u62d3\u5c55\u5230\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u590d\u6742\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5904\u7406\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u5173\u8054\u6027\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5206\u89e3\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u89c6\u89d2\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "1) \u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u8f93\u5165\uff1b2) \u91c7\u7528\u7269\u7406\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6210\u50cf\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u89e3\u4e3adiffuse\u53cd\u5c04\u3001diffuse\u9634\u5f71\u3001specular\u9634\u5f71\uff1b3) \u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5206\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u5206\u79bbLambertian\uff08\u6f2b\u53cd\u5c04\uff09\u548c\u975eLambertian\uff08\u955c\u9762\u53cd\u5c04\uff09\u5149\u5b66\u4f20\u8f93\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1b4) \u5b9e\u73b0\u5355\u6b21\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u5b8c\u6210\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8fed\u4ee3\u91c7\u6837\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff1a1) \u5206\u89e3\u5f97\u5230\u7684diffuse\u53cd\u5c04\u66f4\u6e05\u6670\uff1b2) diffuse\u9634\u5f71\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\uff1b3) \u7279\u5b9a\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0b\u7684specular\u5206\u91cf\u5206\u79bb\u66f4\u7cbe\u51c6\uff1b4) \u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6307\u6807\u8d85\u8d8a\u6240\u6709\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u53473\u500d\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002\u7279\u522b\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u5149\u7167\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4ecd\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "IDT\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06Transformer\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5355\u6b21\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u672c\u5f81\u5206\u89e3\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5206\u89e3\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u89c6\u89d2\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u7a81\u7834\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e09\u7ef4\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u6750\u8d28\u7f16\u8f91\u7b49\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Our key observation is that modern video diffusion models already synthesize convincing transparent phenomena, suggesting they have internalized the optical rules. We build TransPhy3D, a synthetic video corpus of transparent/reflective scenes: 11k sequences rendered with Blender/Cycles. Scenes are assembled from a curated bank of category-rich static assets and shape-rich procedural assets paired with glass/plastic/metal materials. We render RGB + depth + normals with physically based ray tracing and OptiX denoising. Starting from a large video diffusion model, we learn a video-to-video translator for depth (and normals) via lightweight LoRA adapters. During training we concatenate RGB and (noisy) depth latents in the DiT backbone and co-train on TransPhy3D and existing frame-wise synthetic datasets, yielding temporally consistent predictions for arbitrary-length input videos. The resulting model, DKT, achieves zero-shot SOTA on real and synthetic video benchmarks involving transparency: ClearPose, DREDS (CatKnown/CatNovel), and TransPhy3D-Test. It improves accuracy and temporal consistency over strong image/video baselines, and a normal variant sets the best video normal estimation results on ClearPose. A compact 1.3B version runs at ~0.17 s/frame. Integrated into a grasping stack, DKT's depth boosts success rates across translucent, reflective and diffuse surfaces, outperforming prior estimators. Together, these results support a broader claim: \"Diffusion knows transparency.\" Generative video priors can be repurposed, efficiently and label-free, into robust, temporally coherent perception for challenging real-world manipulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faDKT\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u5347\u900f\u660e\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c\u6cd5\u7ebf\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6TransPhy3D\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u900f\u660e\u548c\u53cd\u5c04\u7269\u4f53\u5bfc\u81f4\u73b0\u6709\u611f\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u56e0\u6298\u5c04\u3001\u53cd\u5c04\u548c\u900f\u5c04\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u800c\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5df2\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u903c\u771f\u7684\u900f\u660e\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u63a8\u6d4b\u5176\u5b66\u4e60\u4e86\u5149\u5b66\u89c4\u5219\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b11k\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u5408\u6210\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u96c6TransPhy3D\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u6e32\u67d3\u751f\u6210RGB/\u6df1\u5ea6/\u6cd5\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528LoRA\u9002\u914d\u5668\u5fae\u8c03\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b0\u65e7\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "DKT\u5728\u6d89\u53ca\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u4e0e\u5408\u6210\u89c6\u9891\u57fa\u51c6\uff08\u5982ClearPose\u3001TransPhy3D-Test\uff09\u4e0a\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6027\u80fd\u9886\u5148\uff0c0.17\u79d2/\u5e27\u901f\u5ea6\u63a8\u52a8\u6293\u53d6\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u5907\u7406\u89e3\u900f\u660e\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6807\u7b7e\u5373\u53ef\u9ad8\u6548\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002"}}

We propose Stream-DiffVSR, a causally conditioned diffusion framework for efficient online VSR. Operating strictly on past frames, it combines a four-step distilled denoiser for fast inference, an Auto-regressive Temporal Guidance (ARTG) module that injects motion-aligned cues during latent denoising, and a lightweight temporal-aware decoder with a Temporal Processor Module (TPM) that enhances detail and temporal coherence. Stream-DiffVSR processes 720p frames in 0.328 seconds on an RTX4090 GPU and significantly outperforms prior diffusion-based methods. Compared with the online SOTA TMP, it boosts perceptual quality (LPIPS +0.095) while reducing latency by over 130x. Stream-DiffVSR achieves the lowest latency reported for diffusion-based VSR, reducing initial delay from over 4600 seconds to 0.328 seconds, thereby making it the first diffusion VSR method suitable for low-latency online deployment.
