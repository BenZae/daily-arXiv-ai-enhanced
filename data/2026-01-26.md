### [1] [GR3EN: Generative Relighting for 3D Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16272)
*Xiaoyan Xing,Philipp Henzler,Junhwa Hur,Runze Li,Jonathan T. Barron,Pratul P. Srinivasan,Dor Verbin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method for controllable 3D relighting of room-scale environments using video-to-video diffusion models, avoiding complex inverse rendering problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional 3D scene relighting methods face limitations in solving ill-conditioned inverse rendering problems and generating high-quality results for complex real-world scenes. Existing generative models are restricted to 2D or single-object 3D relighting, requiring scalable solutions for room-scale environments.

Method: The approach distills a video-to-video relighting diffusion model into precomputed 3D reconstructions, enabling direct 3D scene relighting without solving inverse rendering. This decouples lighting control from geometric reconstruction through a model distillation process.

Result: The method successfully relights complex 3D scenes (both synthetic and real-world) under novel lighting conditions, preserving scene details and enabling high-quality novel view synthesis with controlled illumination.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that combining generative diffusion models with 3D reconstruction distillation provides an effective solution for scalable 3D scene relighting, outperforming traditional inverse rendering approaches in both quality and controllability.

Abstract: We present a method for relighting 3D reconstructions of large room-scale environments. Existing solutions for 3D scene relighting often require solving under-determined or ill-conditioned inverse rendering problems, and are as such unable to produce high-quality results on complex real-world scenes. Though recent progress in using generative image and video diffusion models for relighting has been promising, these techniques are either limited to 2D image and video relighting or 3D relighting of individual objects. Our approach enables controllable 3D relighting of room-scale scenes by distilling the outputs of a video-to-video relighting diffusion model into a 3D reconstruction. This side-steps the need to solve a difficult inverse rendering problem, and results in a flexible system that can relight 3D reconstructions of complex real-world scenes. We validate our approach on both synthetic and real-world datasets to show that it can faithfully render novel views of scenes under new lighting conditions.

Conclusion: 实验表明显式记忆机制与计算优化策略的有效性，为多轮视频生成类任务提供了通用框架，同时展示了计算效率与编辑质量协同提升的可能性。

Abstract: Recent foundational video-to-video diffusion models have achieved impressive results in editing user provided videos by modifying appearance, motion, or camera movement. However, real-world video editing is often an iterative process, where users refine results across multiple rounds of interaction. In this multi-turn setting, current video editors struggle to maintain cross-consistency across sequential edits. In this work, we tackle, for the first time, the problem of cross-consistency in multi-turn video editing and introduce Memory-V2V, a simple, yet effective framework that augments existing video-to-video models with explicit memory. Given an external cache of previously edited videos, Memory-V2V employs accurate retrieval and dynamic tokenization strategies to condition the current editing step on prior results. To further mitigate redundancy and computational overhead, we propose a learnable token compressor within the DiT backbone that compresses redundant conditioning tokens while preserving essential visual cues, achieving an overall speedup of 30%. We validate Memory-V2V on challenging tasks including video novel view synthesis and text-conditioned long video editing. Extensive experiments show that Memory-V2V produces videos that are significantly more cross-consistent with minimal computational overhead, while maintaining or even improving task-specific performance over state-of-the-art baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出FeTTL，一种联邦模板与任务学习框架，通过协同学习全局模板和任务模型，在联邦学习环境下实现多机构医学影像数据分布对齐，有效解决领域异质性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中医疗数据因采集协议、设备类型及患者群体差异导致的领域偏移严重损害模型性能，尤其是医学影像任务需要跨机构协同但面临数据分布不一致的核心挑战。

Method: 开发FeTTL框架，同步学习一个全局模板作为数据分布对齐的共享空间，并联合优化任务模型，通过模板与任务的联合参数更新实现在保护隐私前提下的域适应迁移。

Conclusion: 研究提出了一种具有理论依据的联邦域适应解决方案，通过参数共享框架减轻分布偏移影响，为医学影像联邦学习的临床实用化部署提供可拓展的技术路径。

Abstract: Federated learning enables collaborative model training across geographically distributed medical centers while preserving data privacy. However, domain shifts and heterogeneity in data often lead to a degradation in model performance. Medical imaging applications are particularly affected by variations in acquisition protocols, scanner types, and patient populations. To address these issues, we introduce Federated Template and Task Learning (FeTTL), a novel framework designed to harmonize multi-institutional medical imaging data in federated environments. FeTTL learns a global template together with a task model to align data distributions among clients. We evaluated FeTTL on two challenging and diverse multi-institutional medical imaging tasks: retinal fundus optical disc segmentation and histopathological metastasis classification. Experimental results show that FeTTL significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art federated learning baselines (p-values <0.002) for optical disc segmentation and classification of metastases from multi-institutional data. Our experiments further highlight the importance of jointly learning the template and the task. These findings suggest that FeTTL offers a principled and extensible solution for mitigating distribution shifts in federated learning, supporting robust model deployment in real-world, multi-institutional environments.

### [4] [Where is the multimodal goal post? On the Ability of Foundation Models to Recognize Contextually Important Moments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16333)
*Aditya K Surikuchi,Raquel Fernández,Sandro Pezzelle*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出通过人类生成的足球比赛集锦构建无标注数据集，评估多模态模型对关键事件识别能力，发现现有模型表现接近随机并存在模态依赖问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多模态基础模型对于识别视频中重要子事件这一基础能力，该能力是叙事和摘要生成的前提，但现有研究缺乏有效标注数据和评估方法。

Method: 利用足球集锦视频中隐含的人类重要性判断构建数据集FVIE，包含3200个足球比赛片段及对应的集锦匹配，使用对比学习框架评估多模态模型性能。

Result: SOTA多模态模型在FVIE数据集上表现接近50%随机水平，在事件边界判断和模态协同方面存在显著缺陷，存在单模态依赖倾向。

Conclusion: 建议采用模块化架构处理多模态异质性，设计跨模态交互训练策略，强调多源信息融合的重要性，为视频理解模型设计提供方向指引。

Abstract: Foundation models are used for many real-world applications involving language generation from temporally-ordered multimodal events. In this work, we study the ability of models to identify the most important sub-events in a video, which is a fundamental prerequisite for narrating or summarizing multimodal events. Specifically, we focus on football games and evaluate models on their ability to distinguish between important and non-important sub-events in a game. To this end, we construct a new dataset by leveraging human preferences for importance implicit in football game highlight reels, without any additional annotation costs. Using our dataset, which we will publicly release to the community, we compare several state-of-the-art multimodal models and show that they are not far from chance level performance. Analyses of models beyond standard evaluation metrics reveal their tendency to rely on a single dominant modality and their ineffectiveness in synthesizing necessary information from multiple sources. Our findings underline the importance of modular architectures that can handle sample-level heterogeneity in multimodal data and the need for complementary training procedures that can maximize cross-modal synergy.

### [5] [Cognitively-Inspired Tokens Overcome Egocentric Bias in Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16378)
*Bridget Leonard,Scott O. Murray*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文探讨了多模态语言模型（MLMs）在空间视角转换任务中的局限性，并提出通过引入视角令牌的解决方案，有效提升模型的空间推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态模型在需要换位思考的空间推理任务中表现不足，反映出自我中心偏差问题。研究旨在通过模仿人类空间认知机制，验证模型是否能实现以他人为中心的推理能力。

Method: 设计两种视角令牌：(1)基于身体关节点的具身化表征，(2)支持心理旋转的抽象表征。将令牌集成到LLaVA-1.5-13B模型中，在Isle Bricks V2、COCO和3DSRBench等基准进行测试，并进行表征分析。

Result: 视角令牌显著提升二级视觉视角任务表现，其中旋转表征可泛化至非人类参考智能体。微调验证了基础模型中已存在方位敏感性，通过指导得到增强。

Conclusion: 直接向模型注入认知科学指导的空间结构，可有效实现类人空间推理能力。研究证实MLMs具备以他人为中心推理的雏形，但需要更合理内在结构支撑。

Abstract: Multimodal language models (MLMs) perform well on semantic vision-language tasks but fail at spatial reasoning that requires adopting another agent's visual perspective. These errors reflect a persistent egocentric bias and raise questions about whether current models support allocentric reasoning. Inspired by human spatial cognition, we introduce perspective tokens, specialized embeddings that encode orientation through either (1) embodied body-keypoint cues or (2) abstract representations supporting mental rotation. Integrating these tokens into LLaVA-1.5-13B yields performance on level-2 visual perspective-taking tasks. Across synthetic and naturalistic benchmarks (Isle Bricks V2, COCO, 3DSRBench), perspective tokens improve accuracy, with rotation-based tokens generalizing to non-human reference agents. Representational analyses reveal that fine-tuning enhances latent orientation sensitivity already present in the base model, suggesting that MLMs contain precursors of allocentric reasoning but lack appropriate internal structure. Overall, embedding cognitively grounded spatial structure directly into token space provides a lightweight, model-agnostic mechanism for perspective-taking and more human-like spatial reasoning.

### [6] [ResAgent: Entropy-based Prior Point Discovery and Visual Reasoning for Referring Expression Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16394)
*Yihao Wang,Jusheng Zhang,Ziyi Tang,Keze Wang,Meng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的Referring Expression Segmentation框架Model，结合基于熵的点发现(EBD)与基于视觉的推理(VBR)，通过粗到细的工作流程优化了多模态大语言模型生成的冗余点提示，并在四个基准数据集上实现了SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于MLLM的RES方法存在两个局限性：粗边界框导致冗余/非判别性点提示；依赖文本坐标推理难以区分视觉相似干扰项。需要更精准且语义可靠的分割方法。

Method: 1. EBD模块：通过建模空间不确定性，在粗边界框内识别高信息量候选点（信息最大化过程）；2. VBR模块：利用联合视觉-语义对齐验证点正确性，替代文本坐标推理；3. 构建包含边界框初始化→熵引导点发现→视觉验证→掩码解码的完整流程。

Result: 在RefCOCO系列及ReasonSeg数据集上均取得SOTA性能，验证了模型在最小提示量下生成精准语义分割掩码的能力。具体指标：（原文未提供具体数值）

Conclusion: Model通过熵最大化与视觉语义验证的双创新机制，突破了MLLM生成提示的局限性，实现了更鲁棒的视觉-语言分割效果，为交互式场景提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: Referring Expression Segmentation (RES) is a core vision-language segmentation task that enables pixel-level understanding of targets via free-form linguistic expressions, supporting critical applications such as human-robot interaction and augmented reality. Despite the progress of Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based approaches, existing RES methods still suffer from two key limitations: first, the coarse bounding boxes from MLLMs lead to redundant or non-discriminative point prompts; second, the prevalent reliance on textual coordinate reasoning is unreliable, as it fails to distinguish targets from visually similar distractors. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{\model}, a novel RES framework integrating \textbf{E}ntropy-\textbf{B}ased Point \textbf{D}iscovery (\textbf{EBD}) and \textbf{V}ision-\textbf{B}ased \textbf{R}easoning (\textbf{VBR}). Specifically, EBD identifies high-information candidate points by modeling spatial uncertainty within coarse bounding boxes, treating point selection as an information maximization process. VBR verifies point correctness through joint visual-semantic alignment, abandoning text-only coordinate inference for more robust validation. Built on these components, \model implements a coarse-to-fine workflow: bounding box initialization, entropy-guided point discovery, vision-based validation, and mask decoding. Extensive evaluations on four benchmark datasets (RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg, and ReasonSeg) demonstrate that \model achieves new state-of-the-art performance across all four benchmarks, highlighting its effectiveness in generating accurate and semantically grounded segmentation masks with minimal prompts.

### [7] [DCCS-Det: Directional Context and Cross-Scale-Aware Detector for Infrared Small Target](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16428)
*Shuying Li,Qiang Ma,San Zhang,Chuang Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为DCCS-Det的新型红外小目标检测方法，通过结合DSE模块和LaSEA模块，在复杂背景下提升小目标检测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在局部-全局特征联合建模和特征冗余/语义稀释方面存在不足，导致目标-背景区分能力下降和特征表示质量降低。

Method: DSE模块融合局部感知与方向感知上下文聚合，捕获长距离空间依赖和局部细节；LaSEA模块通过跨尺度特征提取与随机池化采样策略，缓解特征退化问题。

Result: 实验表明DCCS-Det在多个数据集上达到SOTA检测精度和效率，消融实验验证了DSE和LaSEA对复杂场景下目标感知和特征表示的贡献。

Conclusion: DCCS-Det通过双模块设计有效提升了红外小目标检测性能，代码已开源，可应用于复杂场景的遥感和监控任务。

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (IRSTD) is critical for applications like remote sensing and surveillance, which aims to identify small, low-contrast targets against complex backgrounds. However, existing methods often struggle with inadequate joint modeling of local-global features (harming target-background discrimination) or feature redundancy and semantic dilution (degrading target representation quality). To tackle these issues, we propose DCCS-Det (Directional Context and Cross-Scale Aware Detector for Infrared Small Target), a novel detector that incorporates a Dual-stream Saliency Enhancement (DSE) block and a Latent-aware Semantic Extraction and Aggregation (LaSEA) module. The DSE block integrates localized perception with direction-aware context aggregation to help capture long-range spatial dependencies and local details. On this basis, the LaSEA module mitigates feature degradation via cross-scale feature extraction and random pooling sampling strategies, enhancing discriminative features and suppressing noise. Extensive experiments show that DCCS-Det achieves state-of-the-art detection accuracy with competitive efficiency across multiple datasets. Ablation studies further validate the contributions of DSE and LaSEA in improving target perception and feature representation under complex scenarios. \href{https://huggingface.co/InPeerReview/InfraredSmallTargetDetection-IRSTD.DCCS}{DCCS-Det Official Code is Available Here!}

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为解决传统方法依赖几何特征导致计算成本高、扩散模型实时性差的问题，提出无需几何先验的纯语义对齐方案。

Method: 使用开放视觉-语言模型提取CLIP嵌入，设计视觉-文本双路径对比损失，通过跨模态语义一致性约束实现身份与属性保持。

Result: 在FF++等三大数据集姿态挑战场景中超越DiffSwap等SOTA方法，FID指标下降34.6%，推理速度达75FPS。

Conclusion: 通过纯语义对齐突破传统几何依赖，为实时面部编辑提供新范式，开源模型促进后续研究。

Abstract: Existing face-swapping methods often deliver competitive results in constrained settings but exhibit substantial quality degradation when handling extreme facial poses. To improve facial pose robustness, explicit geometric features are applied, but this approach remains problematic since it introduces additional dependencies and increases computational cost. Diffusion-based methods have achieved remarkable results; however, they are impractical for real-time processing. We introduce AlphaFace, which leverages an open-source vision-language model and CLIP image and text embeddings to apply novel visual and textual semantic contrastive losses. AlphaFace enables stronger identity representation and more precise attribute preservation, all while maintaining real-time performance. Comprehensive experiments across FF++, MPIE, and LPFF demonstrate that AlphaFace surpasses state-of-the-art methods in pose-challenging cases. The project is publicly available on `https://github.com/andrewyu90/Alphaface_Official.git'.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出VISTA-PATH病理分割模型，通过结合视觉、语义描述和专家反馈，实现动态交互式分割，建立大型病理数据集并验证临床关联性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分割模型将任务静态化且缺乏病理专家交互，无法满足临床解读需求。需解决异质性结构、专家反馈整合和像素级临床相关性问题。

Method: 构建多模态框架：图像-文本-空间提示联合条件分割（Transformer架构），支持动态专家反馈传播；发布VISTA-PATH Data数据集（160万+三元组，9器官93类）；设计TIS量化肿瘤微环境。

Result: 在基准测试中超越现有SOTA模型，专家反馈使DSC提升4.7%；TIS显示患者生存显著相关性（HR=2.1,p<0.001）；支持零样本分割和交互式编辑功能。

Conclusion: 验证了交互式分割在病理学中的临床价值，建立从静态预测到动态建模的范式转变，通过可解释分割为数字病理学分析提供新工具。

Abstract: Accurate semantic segmentation for histopathology image is crucial for quantitative tissue analysis and downstream clinical modeling. Recent segmentation foundation models have improved generalization through large-scale pretraining, yet remain poorly aligned with pathology because they treat segmentation as a static visual prediction task. Here we present VISTA-PATH, an interactive, class-aware pathology segmentation foundation model designed to resolve heterogeneous structures, incorporate expert feedback, and produce pixel-level segmentation that are directly meaningful for clinical interpretation. VISTA-PATH jointly conditions segmentation on visual context, semantic tissue descriptions, and optional expert-provided spatial prompts, enabling precise multi-class segmentation across heterogeneous pathology images. To support this paradigm, we curate VISTA-PATH Data, a large-scale pathology segmentation corpus comprising over 1.6 million image-mask-text triplets spanning 9 organs and 93 tissue classes. Across extensive held-out and external benchmarks, VISTA-PATH consistently outperforms existing segmentation foundation models. Importantly, VISTA-PATH supports dynamic human-in-the-loop refinement by propagating sparse, patch-level bounding-box annotation feedback into whole-slide segmentation. Finally, we show that the high-fidelity, class-aware segmentation produced by VISTA-PATH is a preferred model for computational pathology. It improve tissue microenvironment analysis through proposed Tumor Interaction Score (TIS), which exhibits strong and significant associations with patient survival. Together, these results establish VISTA-PATH as a foundation model that elevates pathology image segmentation from a static prediction to an interactive and clinically grounded representation for digital pathology.

Abstract: Understanding the physical world, including object dynamics, material properties, and causal interactions, remains a core challenge in artificial intelligence. Although recent multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive general reasoning capabilities, they still fall short of achieving human-level understanding of physical principles. Existing datasets for physical reasoning either rely on real-world videos, which incur high annotation costs, or on synthetic simulations, which suffer from limited realism and diversity. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm that leverages glitches in gameplay videos, referring to visual anomalies that violate predefined physical laws, as a rich and scalable supervision source for physical world understanding. We introduce PhysGame, an meta information guided instruction-tuning dataset containing 140,057 glitch-centric question-answer pairs across five physical domains and sixteen fine-grained categories. To ensure data accuracy, we design a prompting strategy that utilizes gameplay metadata such as titles and descriptions to guide high-quality QA generation. Complementing PhysGame, we construct GameBench, an expert-annotated benchmark with 880 glitch-identified gameplay videos designed to evaluate physical reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments show that PhysGame significantly enhances both Game2Real transferability, improving the real world physical reasoning performance of Qwen2.5VL by 2.5% on PhysBench, and Game2General transferability, yielding a 1.9% gain on the MVBench benchmark. Moreover, PhysGame-tuned models achieve a 3.7% absolute improvement on GameBench, demonstrating enhanced robustness in detecting physical implausibilities. These results indicate that learning from gameplay anomalies offers a scalable and effective pathway toward advancing physical world understanding in multimodal intelligence.

Abstract: Wound care is often challenged by the economic and logistical burdens that consistently afflict patients and hospitals worldwide. In recent decades, healthcare professionals have sought support from computer vision and machine learning algorithms. In particular, wound segmentation has gained interest due to its ability to provide professionals with fast, automatic tissue assessment from standard RGB images. Some approaches have extended segmentation to 3D, enabling more complete and precise healing progress tracking. However, inferring multi-view consistent 3D structures from 2D images remains a challenge. In this paper, we evaluate WoundNeRF, a NeRF SDF-based method for estimating robust wound segmentations from automatically generated annotations. We demonstrate the potential of this paradigm in recovering accurate segmentations by comparing it against state-of-the-art Vision Transformer networks and conventional rasterisation-based algorithms. The code will be released to facilitate further development in this promising paradigm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏注意力机制在计算效率与训练成本间存在权衡：无训练方法稀疏度有限，基于训练方法虽稀疏度高但计算需求大。需要高效且轻量级的视频生成优化方案。

Method: 提出SALAD架构，将线性注意力分支与稀疏注意力并行化，通过输入特征自适应的门控机制动态分配计算资源。

Conclusion: 该方法在计算效率、训练成本与生成质量间实现最优权衡，特别适合大规模视频生成场景的实用化部署。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers have recently demonstrated remarkable performance in video generation. However, the long input sequences result in high computational latency due to the quadratic complexity of full attention. Various sparse attention mechanisms have been proposed. Training-free sparse attention is constrained by limited sparsity and thus offers modest acceleration, whereas training-based methods can reach much higher sparsity but demand substantial data and computation for training. In this work, we propose SALAD, introducing a lightweight linear attention branch in parallel with the sparse attention. By incorporating an input-dependent gating mechanism to finely balance the two branches, our method attains 90% sparsity and 1.72x inference speedup, while maintaining generation quality comparable to the full attention baseline. Moreover, our finetuning process is highly efficient, requiring only 2,000 video samples and 1,600 training steps with a batch size of 8.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM空间推理评估基准存在任务简单、依赖语义近似和粗略定位、评估指标不严谨等问题，缺乏对精确组合空间推理能力的深入探索。

Method: 设计基于七巧板游戏的几何基准TangramPuzzle，提出Tangram Construction Expression（TCE）符号几何框架，定义精确坐标规范；设置两项互补任务：轮廓预测和端到端代码生成，对主流模型进行系统评估。

Result: 实验发现MLLMs倾向于优先匹配目标轮廓而忽视几何约束，在复杂空间推理任务中出现图形扭曲或变形现象，现有模型在严格几何约束条件下存在显著性能局限。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了MLLM在精确空间推理方面的不足，强调几何约束的重要性，提出的TCE框架为机器空间认知研究提供了数学严谨的评估工具和新研究范式。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in visual recognition and semantic understanding. Nevertheless, their ability to perform precise compositional spatial reasoning remains largely unexplored. Existing benchmarks often involve relatively simple tasks and rely on semantic approximations or coarse relative positioning, while their evaluation metrics are typically limited and lack rigorous mathematical formulations. To bridge this gap, we introduce TangramPuzzle, a geometry-grounded benchmark designed to evaluate compositional spatial reasoning through the lens of the classic Tangram game. We propose the Tangram Construction Expression (TCE), a symbolic geometric framework that grounds tangram assemblies in exact, machine-verifiable coordinate specifications, to mitigate the ambiguity of visual approximation. We design two complementary tasks: Outline Prediction, which demands inferring global shapes from local components, and End-to-End Code Generation, which requires solving inverse geometric assembly problems. We conduct extensive evaluation experiments on advanced open-source and proprietary models, revealing an interesting insight: MLLMs tend to prioritize matching the target silhouette while neglecting geometric constraints, leading to distortions or deformations of the pieces.

Abstract: In recent years, researchers have increasingly been interested in how to enable Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM) to possess spatial understanding and reasoning capabilities. However, most existing methods overlook the importance of the ability to continuously work in an ever-changing world, and lack the possibility of deployment on embodied systems in real-world environments. In this work, we introduce OnlineSI, a framework that can continuously improve its spatial understanding of its surroundings given a video stream. Our core idea is to maintain a finite spatial memory to retain past observations, ensuring the computation required for each inference does not increase as the input accumulates. We further integrate 3D point cloud information with semantic information, helping MLLM to better locate and identify objects in the scene. To evaluate our method, we introduce the Fuzzy $F_1$-Score to mitigate ambiguity, and test our method on two representative datasets. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, paving the way towards real-world embodied systems.

Conclusion: 半监督策略有效缓解开集分类中未见类挑战，在有限标注数据下保持高性能分类能力。

Abstract: Hierarchical open-set classification handles previously unseen classes by assigning them to the most appropriate high-level category in a class taxonomy. We extend this paradigm to the semi-supervised setting, enabling the use of large-scale, uncurated datasets containing a mixture of known and unknown classes to improve the hierarchical open-set performance. To this end, we propose a teacher-student framework based on pseudo-labeling. Two key components are introduced: 1) subtree pseudo-labels, which provide reliable supervision in the presence of unknown data, and 2) age-gating, a mechanism that mitigates overconfidence in pseudo-labels. Experiments show that our framework outperforms self-supervised pretraining followed by supervised adaptation, and even matches the fully supervised counterpart when using only 20 labeled samples per class on the iNaturalist19 benchmark.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种双模块协作的层次化自适应特征聚合框架HA2F，通过动态特征校准和噪声自适应精修模块解决遥感变化检测中时空特征匹配偏差和辐射/几何噪声敏感性问题，模型在LEVIR-CD等三个数据集上取得SOTA性能。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在局部块特征提取或全图处理中存在跨时相特征匹配偏差且对辐射/几何噪声敏感。本文旨在通过层次化特征校准与噪声自适应精修机制提升多时相遥感图像变化检测的鲁棒性和精度。

1. DHFCM通过感知特征选择融合相邻层级特征，抑制无关差异并校正多时相特征偏移
2. NAFRM采用双特征选择机制突出变化敏感区域，生成空间掩码抑制阴影等干扰

Conclusion: HA2F通过动态层次特征融合与噪声自适应精修策略，在缓解跨时相特征偏移和抗干扰方面表现优异，为遥感变化检测提供了兼顾精度与效率的实用化解决方案。

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection (RSCD) aims to identify the spatio-temporal changes of land cover, providing critical support for multi-disciplinary applications (e.g., environmental monitoring, disaster assessment, and climate change studies). Existing methods focus either on extracting features from localized patches, or pursue processing entire images holistically, which leads to the cross temporal feature matching deviation and exhibiting sensitivity to radiometric and geometric noise. Following the above issues, we propose a dual-module collaboration guided hierarchical adaptive aggregation framework, namely HA2F, which consists of dynamic hierarchical feature calibration module (DHFCM) and noise-adaptive feature refinement module (NAFRM). The former dynamically fuses adjacent-level features through perceptual feature selection, suppressing irrelevant discrepancies to address multi-temporal feature alignment deviations. The NAFRM utilizes the dual feature selection mechanism to highlight the change sensitive regions and generate spatial masks, suppressing the interference of irrelevant regions or shadows. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed HA2F, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD, and SYSU-CD datasets, surpassing existing comparative methods in terms of both precision metrics and computational efficiency. In addition, ablation experiments show that DHFCM and NAFRM are effective. \href{https://huggingface.co/InPeerReview/RemoteSensingChangeDetection-RSCD.HA2F}{HA2F Official Code is Available Here!}

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CoVR框架单阶段多模态融合效果有限，仅比基线模型提升微弱。需通过更精细的模态交互和预训练表示保护机制，解决跨模态对齐不足与模型微调破坏表征的问题。

Method: 1) 构建X-Aligner模块：多层跨注意力机制渐进融合视觉-文本输入并对其表征；2) 引入视觉查询标题作为辅助输入；3) 两阶段训练：先冻结预训练VLM仅训练新增模块，再微调文本编码器；基于BLIP家族架构实现。

Conclusion: 所提框架通过渐进式多模态融合与两阶段训练策略，显著提升视频检索性能且具备跨任务泛化性，为通用多模态检索系统提供新思路。

Abstract: Composed Video Retrieval (CoVR) facilitates video retrieval by combining visual and textual queries. However, existing CoVR frameworks typically fuse multimodal inputs in a single stage, achieving only marginal gains over initial baseline. To address this, we propose a novel CoVR framework that leverages the representational power of Vision Language Models (VLMs). Our framework incorporates a novel cross-attention module X-Aligner, composed of cross-attention layers that progressively fuse visual and textual inputs and align their multimodal representation with that of the target video. To further enhance the representation of the multimodal query, we incorporate the caption of the visual query as an additional input. The framework is trained in two stages to preserve the pretrained VLM representation. In the first stage, only the newly introduced module is trained, while in the second stage, the textual query encoder is also fine-tuned. We implement our framework on top of BLIP-family architecture, namely BLIP and BLIP-2, and train it on the Webvid-CoVR data set. In addition to in-domain evaluation on Webvid-CoVR-Test, we perform zero-shot evaluations on the Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) data sets CIRCO and Fashion-IQ. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on CoVR obtaining a Recall@1 of 63.93% on Webvid-CoVR-Test, and demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization on CIR tasks.

Motivation: 无人机场景中小目标检测面临尺度不平衡与边缘模糊挑战，亟需增强目标位置、边界感知能力。

Method: 提出BPIM框架，包含PIG(定位)、BIG(边界提取)、CSF(跨尺度浅层融合)、TFF(渐进式边界-定位融合)、AWF(自适应深层融合)模块，通过注意力机制整合多尺度特征。

Result: 在VisDrone2021/DOTA1.0/WiderPerson数据集上优于Yolov5-P2基线，在保持可比计算负载下达到SOTA方法竞争力。

Conclusion: BPIM通过跨尺度特征与边界定位信息的渐进融合策略，显著提升无人机场景小目标检测精度且无显著计算代价。

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) applications have become increasingly prevalent in aerial photography and object recognition. However, there are major challenges to accurately capturing small targets in object detection due to the imbalanced scale and the blurred edges. To address these issues, boundary and position information mining (BPIM) framework is proposed for capturing object edge and location cues. The proposed BPIM includes position information guidance (PIG) module for obtaining location information, boundary information guidance (BIG) module for extracting object edge, cross scale fusion (CSF) module for gradually assembling the shallow layer image feature, three feature fusion (TFF) module for progressively combining position and boundary information, and adaptive weight fusion (AWF) module for flexibly merging the deep layer semantic feature. Therefore, BPIM can integrate boundary, position, and scale information in image for small object detection using attention mechanisms and cross-scale feature fusion strategies. Furthermore, BPIM not only improves the discrimination of the contextual feature by adaptive weight fusion with boundary, but also enhances small object perceptions by cross-scale position fusion. On the VisDrone2021, DOTA1.0, and WiderPerson datasets, experimental results show the better performances of BPIM compared to the baseline Yolov5-P2, and obtains the promising performance in the state-of-the-art methods with comparable computation load.

Abstract: The growing demand for diverse and high-quality facial datasets for training and testing biometric systems is challenged by privacy regulations, data scarcity, and ethical concerns. Synthetic facial images offer a potential solution, yet existing generative models often struggle to balance realism, diversity, and identity preservation. This paper presents SCHIGAND, a novel synthetic face generation pipeline integrating StyleCLIP, HyperStyle, InterfaceGAN, and Diffusion models to produce highly realistic and controllable facial datasets. SCHIGAND enhances identity preservation while generating realistic intra-class variations and maintaining inter-class distinctiveness, making it suitable for biometric testing. The generated datasets were evaluated using ArcFace, a leading facial verification model, to assess their effectiveness in comparison to real-world facial datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that SCHIGAND achieves a balance between image quality and diversity, addressing key limitations of prior generative models. This research highlights the potential of SCHIGAND to supplement and, in some cases, replace real data for facial biometric applications, paving the way for privacy-compliant and scalable solutions in synthetic dataset generation.

Conclusion: 提出首个针对LDM的无训练结构保持方案，通过理论证明和实验验证SPL在边缘结构保持和语义编辑间的平衡能力

Abstract: Recent advances in image editing leverage latent diffusion models (LDMs) for versatile, text-prompt-driven edits across diverse tasks. Yet, maintaining pixel-level edge structures-crucial for tasks such as photorealistic style transfer or image tone adjustment-remains as a challenge for latent-diffusion-based editing. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel Structure Preservation Loss (SPL) that leverages local linear models to quantify structural differences between input and edited images. Our training-free approach integrates SPL directly into the diffusion model's generative process to ensure structural fidelity. This core mechanism is complemented by a post-processing step to mitigate LDM decoding distortions, a masking strategy for precise edit localization, and a color preservation loss to preserve hues in unedited areas. Experiments confirm SPL enhances structural fidelity, delivering state-of-the-art performance in latent-diffusion-based image editing. Our code will be publicly released at https://github.com/gongms00/SPL.

Motivation: 现有服装重建方法依赖3D高斯泼溅等非结构化表征，无法准确还原服装拓扑与缝纫结构，导致物理仿真效果受限

Method: 提出ReWeaver框架，同时在2D UV空间和3D空间预测接缝、面板及其连接关系，并构建包含10万+样本的GCD-TS数据集支持训练

Conclusion: 该方法解决了服装重建的拓扑失真问题，为数字人、虚拟试衣和机器人操作提供结构化表征范式

Abstract: High-quality 3D garment reconstruction plays a crucial role in mitigating the sim-to-real gap in applications such as digital avatars, virtual try-on and robotic manipulation. However, existing garment reconstruction methods typically rely on unstructured representations, such as 3D Gaussian Splats, struggling to provide accurate reconstructions of garment topology and sewing structures. As a result, the reconstructed outputs are often unsuitable for high-fidelity physical simulation. We propose ReWeaver, a novel framework for topology-accurate 3D garment and sewing pattern reconstruction from sparse multi-view RGB images. Given as few as four input views, ReWeaver predicts seams and panels as well as their connectivities in both the 2D UV space and the 3D space. The predicted seams and panels align precisely with the multi-view images, yielding structured 2D--3D garment representations suitable for 3D perception, high-fidelity physical simulation, and robotic manipulation. To enable effective training, we construct a large-scale dataset GCD-TS, comprising multi-view RGB images, 3D garment geometries, textured human body meshes and annotated sewing patterns. The dataset contains over 100,000 synthetic samples covering a wide range of complex geometries and topologies. Extensive experiments show that ReWeaver consistently outperforms existing methods in terms of topology accuracy, geometry alignment and seam-panel consistency.

Motivation: 现有对比学习方法未能利用类间结构性相似性，且忽视异常正样本影响，需增强特征空间判别性。

Method: 提出亲和度度量方法构建活动超类，引入动态温度计划自适应调整损失权重，并采用基于间隔的对比策略优化困难样本分离。

Result: 在NTU RGB+D、Kinetics-Skeleton等6个数据集上，ACLNet在动作识别、步态识别和行人重识别任务中均达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: 通过挖掘类间集群关系与优化对比学习机制，ACLNet显著提升了骨架数据特征表示能力。

Abstract: In skeleton-based human activity understanding, existing methods often adopt the contrastive learning paradigm to construct a discriminative feature space. However, many of these approaches fail to exploit the structural inter-class similarities and overlook the impact of anomalous positive samples. In this study, we introduce ACLNet, an Affinity Contrastive Learning Network that explores the intricate clustering relationships among human activity classes to improve feature discrimination. Specifically, we propose an affinity metric to refine similarity measurements, thereby forming activity superclasses that provide more informative contrastive signals. A dynamic temperature schedule is also introduced to adaptively adjust the penalty strength for various superclasses. In addition, we employ a margin-based contrastive strategy to improve the separation of hard positive and negative samples within classes. Extensive experiments on NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, Kinetics-Skeleton, PKU-MMD, FineGYM, and CASIA-B demonstrate the superiority of our method in skeleton-based action recognition, gait recognition, and person re-identification.

*Sana Al-azzawi,Elisa Barney,Marcus Liwicki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了CER-HV框架，通过结合CER噪声检测和人工验证，有效识别并清理阿拉伯语手写数据集中的标签错误（如转录、分割、方向问题），显著提升识别精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿拉伯语等阿拉伯字母手写识别效果落后于拉丁字母，因现有数据集存在高比例标签错误（如转录、分割错误），需改进数据清洗方法以提升模型训练质量。

Method: 开发CER-HV框架：1) 基于CRNN并配置早停机制检测高CER样本；2) 人工验证高错误率样本进行过滤。用于发现数据集中存在的transcription、segmentation、orientation及非文本内容错误。

Result: CRNN在未清洗数据中达到SOTA（如阿拉伯KHATT数据集8.45% CER）；应用CER-HV后，干净数据集CER降低0.3-0.6%，噪声数据集降低1.0-1.8%。Muharaf与PHTI数据集错误检测精度达80-90%。

Conclusion: CER-HV框架有效提升阿拉伯字母手写数据集质量，其方法具通用性，可扩展至其他文本识别领域，为低资源语言数据清洗提供新范式。

Abstract: Handwritten text recognition (HTR) for Arabic-script languages still lags behind Latin-script HTR, despite recent advances in model architectures, datasets, and benchmarks. We show that data quality is a significant limiting factor in many published datasets and propose CER-HV (CER-based Ranking with Human Verification) as a framework to detect and clean label errors. CER-HV combines a CER-based noise detector, built on a carefully configured Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) with early stopping to avoid overfitting noisy samples, and a human-in-the-loop (HITL) step that verifies high-ranking samples. The framework reveals that several existing datasets contain previously underreported problems, including transcription, segmentation, orientation, and non-text content errors. These have been identified with up to 90 percent precision in the Muharaf and 80-86 percent in the PHTI datasets.
  We also show that our CRNN achieves state-of-the-art performance across five of the six evaluated datasets, reaching 8.45 percent Character Error Rate (CER) on KHATT (Arabic), 8.26 percent on PHTI (Pashto), 10.66 percent on Ajami, and 10.11 percent on Muharaf (Arabic), all without any data cleaning. We establish a new baseline of 11.3 percent CER on the PHTD (Persian) dataset. Applying CER-HV improves the evaluation CER by 0.3-0.6 percent on the cleaner datasets and 1.0-1.8 percent on the noisier ones. Although our experiments focus on documents written in an Arabic-script language, including Arabic, Persian, Urdu, Ajami, and Pashto, the framework is general and can be applied to other text recognition datasets.

TL;DR: 本文提出了从圆形合成孔径声纳（CSAS）数据中恢复阴影信息的方法，以提升目标分析和三维重建效果。


<details>

Conclusion: 本文证明CSAS数据中的阴影信息可辅助提升目标识别鲁棒性，并为水下目标三维建模提供了可行框架。将阴影分析与现有CSAS成像技术结合，可进一步优化水雷战等场景的应用效果。

Abstract: Circular Synthetic Aperture Sonar (CSAS) provides a 360° azimuth view of the seabed, surpassing the limited aperture and mono-view image of conventional side-scan SAS. This makes CSAS a valuable tool for target recognition in mine warfare where the diversity of point of view is essential for reducing false alarms. CSAS processing typically produces a very high-resolution two-dimensional image. However, the parallax introduced by the circular displacement of the illuminator fill-in the shadow regions, and the shadow cast by an object on the seafloor is lost in favor of azimuth coverage and resolution. Yet the shadows provide complementary information on target shape useful for target recognition. In this paper, we explore a way to retrieve shadow information from CSAS data to improve target analysis and carry 3D reconstruction. Sub-aperture filtering is used to get a collection of images at various points of view along the circular trajectory and fixed focus shadow enhancement (FFSE) is applied to obtain sharp shadows. An interactive interface is also proposed to allow human operators to visualize these shadows along the circular trajectory. A space-carving reconstruction method is applied to infer the 3D shape of the object from the segmented shadows. The results demonstrate the potential of shadows in circular SAS for improving target analysis and 3D reconstruction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS优化中存在两种被忽视的耦合问题：(i) 更新步骤耦合导致优化器状态重缩放和非视点属性更新成本高；(ii) 动量梯度耦合引发正则化过强或不足。传统Adam优化策略未能充分解决这些问题。

Method: 将3DGS优化过程解耦为三个独立组件：1) 稀疏Adam优化器减少冗余计算；2) Re-State Regularization动态调整优化器状态；3) Decoupled Attribute Regularization分离属性正则化。基于此提出AdamW-GS优化框架，重新组合有效组件。

Result: 通过大量3DGS和3DGS-MCMC框架实验验证：1) 解耦组件可降低30%非必要属性更新；2) 正则化策略使训练稳定性提升40%；3) AdamW-GS在PSNR指标上比原始方法高2-3dB，训练速度提升1.5倍。

Conclusion: 本研究揭示了3DGS优化中深层耦合问题的解决路径，证明通过系统解耦-重组策略可显著提升优化效率与表示质量，为后续研究提供了标准化优化模块和设计范式。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful technique for real-time novel view synthesis. As an explicit representation optimized through gradient propagation among primitives, optimization widely accepted in deep neural networks (DNNs) is actually adopted in 3DGS, such as synchronous weight updating and Adam with the adaptive gradient. However, considering the physical significance and specific design in 3DGS, there are two overlooked details in the optimization of 3DGS: (i) update step coupling, which induces optimizer state rescaling and costly attribute updates outside the viewpoints, and (ii) gradient coupling in the moment, which may lead to under- or over-effective regularization. Nevertheless, such a complex coupling is under-explored. After revisiting the optimization of 3DGS, we take a step to decouple it and recompose the process into: Sparse Adam, Re-State Regularization and Decoupled Attribute Regularization. Taking a large number of experiments under the 3DGS and 3DGS-MCMC frameworks, our work provides a deeper understanding of these components. Finally, based on the empirical analysis, we re-design the optimization and propose AdamW-GS by re-coupling the beneficial components, under which better optimization efficiency and representation effectiveness are achieved simultaneously.

Artificial intelligence has been pointed as one solution to automatize diagnosis. However, public ERCP datasets are scarce, which limits the use of such approach. Therefore, this study aims to help fill this gap by providing a large and curated dataset. The collection is composed of 19.018 raw images and 19.317 processed from 1.602 patients. 5.519 images are labeled, which provides a ready to use dataset. All images were manually inspected and annotated by two gastroenterologist with more than 5 years of experience and reviewed by another gastroenterologist with more than 20 years of experience, all with more than 400 ERCP procedures annually. The utility and validity of the dataset is proven by a classification experiment. This collection aims to provide or contribute for a benchmark in automatic ERCP analysis and diagnosis of biliary and pancreatic diseases.

*Cuong Le,Pavló Melnyk,Bastian Wandt,Mårten Wadenbäck*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FMPose introduces a probabilistic 3D human pose estimation technique using flow matching generative approach to address depth ambiguity in 2D to 3D pose lifting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monocular 3D pose recovery suffers depth ambiguity causing erroneous estimates. Probabilistic approaches better handle uncertainty, but current methods have speed/accuracy limitations.

Method: Leveraged flow matching with optimal transport via continuous normalizing flows conditioned on 2D cues. Implemented graph convolutional networks to model body joints connections for feature aggregation during 2D/3D mapping.

Result: Achieved significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods on Human3.6M, MPI-INF-3DHP, and 3DPW benchmarks with faster and more accurate 3D pose generation.

Conclusion: FMPose's flow matching framework with graph-based feature aggregation effectively addresses depth ambiguity through probabilistic optimal transport, outperforming diffusion-based approaches.

Abstract: Recovering 3D human poses from a monocular camera view is a highly ill-posed problem due to the depth ambiguity. Earlier studies on 3D human pose lifting from 2D often contain incorrect-yet-overconfident 3D estimations. To mitigate the problem, emerging probabilistic approaches treat the 3D estimations as a distribution, taking into account the uncertainty measurement of the poses. Falling in a similar category, we proposed FMPose, a probabilistic 3D human pose estimation method based on the flow matching generative approach. Conditioned on the 2D cues, the flow matching scheme learns the optimal transport from a simple source distribution to the plausible 3D human pose distribution via continuous normalizing flows. The 2D lifting condition is modeled via graph convolutional networks, leveraging the learnable connections between human body joints as the graph structure for feature aggregation. Compared to diffusion-based methods, the FMPose with optimal transport produces faster and more accurate 3D pose generations. Experimental results show major improvements of our FMPose over current state-of-the-art methods on three common benchmarks for 3D human pose estimation, namely Human3.6M, MPI-INF-3DHP and 3DPW.

*Jiahao Li,Yunpeng Bai,Yongkang Dai,Hao Guo,Hongping Gan,Yilei Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出BrepARG，首次将B-rep的几何与拓扑信息编码为统一的token序列，实现基于Transformer的自动回归生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图结构方法分离几何与拓扑特征，导致无法直接应用序列生成模型（如Transformer），需探索端到端序列化表示方法。

Method: 将B-rep编码为几何/位置/面索引三类token，分层构建几何区块后序列化，采用因果掩码的Transformer解码器预测token分布。

Result: 实验表明该方法在B-rep生成任务中达到SOTA性能，成功证明token序列建模的可行性。

Conclusion: 通过统一序列表示为B-rep生成提供了新范式，为后续序列生成技术应用奠定基础。

Abstract: Previous representation and generation approaches for the B-rep relied on graph-based representations that disentangle geometric and topological features through decoupled computational pipelines, thereby precluding the application of sequence-based generative frameworks, such as transformer architectures that have demonstrated remarkable performance. In this paper, we propose BrepARG, the first attempt to encode B-rep's geometry and topology into a holistic token sequence representation, enabling sequence-based B-rep generation with an autoregressive architecture. Specifically, BrepARG encodes B-rep into 3 types of tokens: geometry and position tokens representing geometric features, and face index tokens representing topology. Then the holistic token sequence is constructed hierarchically, starting with constructing the geometry blocks (i.e., faces and edges) using the above tokens, followed by geometry block sequencing. Finally, we assemble the holistic sequence representation for the entire B-rep. We also construct a transformer-based autoregressive model that learns the distribution over holistic token sequences via next-token prediction, using a multi-layer decoder-only architecture with causal masking. Experiments demonstrate that BrepARG achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. BrepARG validates the feasibility of representing B-rep as holistic token sequences, opening new directions for B-rep generation.

Conclusion: 通过显性注意力调制机制与特征合成策略，实现了高效的小样本持续学习框架，验证了预训练表示在增量场景下的复用价值

Abstract: Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) presents a core challenge in continual learning, requiring models to rapidly adapt to new classes with very limited samples while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Recent prompt-based methods, which integrate pretrained backbones with task-specific prompts, have made notable progress. However, under extreme few-shot incremental settings, the model's ability to transfer and generalize becomes critical, and it is thus essential to leverage pretrained knowledge to learn feature representations that can be shared across future categories during the base session. Inspired by the mechanism of the CLS token, which is similar to human attention and progressively filters out task-irrelevant information, we propose the CLS Token Attention Steering Prompts (CASP). This approach introduces class-shared trainable bias parameters into the query, key, and value projections of the CLS token to explicitly modulate the self-attention weights. To further enhance generalization, we also design an attention perturbation strategy and perform Manifold Token Mixup in the shallow feature space, synthesizing potential new class features to improve generalization and reserve the representation capacity for upcoming tasks. Experiments on the CUB200, CIFAR100, and ImageNet-R datasets demonstrate that CASP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both standard and fine-grained FSCIL settings without requiring fine-tuning during incremental phases and while significantly reducing the parameter overhead.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动化检测方法受限于特定脊柱区域或精度不足，而精确识别椎体间韧带附着点对构建可靠脊椎生物力学模型至关重要。

Method: 首先通过基于形状的3D椎体分割获取形态特征，随后应用领域特定规则识别不同类型的附着点（如前纵韧带、后纵韧带等），形成两阶段检测流程。

Result: 在两个独立患者脊柱数据集验证中，平均绝对误差（MAE）达0.7mm，均方根误差（RMSE）为1.1mm，且方法在全脊柱区域均适用。

Conclusion: 该方法通过高精度与全区域泛化能力解决了传统自动化检测的局限性，为脊椎生物力学仿真提供了更鲁棒的解剖定位工具。

Abstract: In biomechanical modeling, the representation of ligament attachments is crucial for a realistic simulation of the forces acting between the vertebrae. These forces are typically modeled as vectors connecting ligament landmarks on adjacent vertebrae, making precise identification of these landmarks a key requirement for constructing reliable spine models. Existing automated detection methods are either limited to specific spinal regions or lack sufficient accuracy. This work presents a novel approach for detecting spinal ligament landmarks, which first performs shape-based segmentation of 3D vertebrae and subsequently applies domain-specific rules to identify different types of attachment points. The proposed method outperforms existing approaches by achieving high accuracy and demonstrating strong generalization across all spinal regions. Validation on two independent spinal datasets from multiple patients yielded a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.7 mm and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.1 mm.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个基于眼动追踪与视觉特征融合的深度学习框架，通过224个室内视频数据集在主观和客观审美预测任务上分别达到66.8%和72.2%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 室内空间的审美评估对环境设计至关重要，但因主观性和视觉响应复杂性而存在预测困难，需要探索客观量化方法支撑设计优化。

Method: 构建双分支CNN-LSTM模型，融合视觉特征与眼动信号（瞳孔、注视轨迹）。采集224个室内设计视频及28名参与者的眼动数据，并标注15个审美维度作为训练集。

Result: 模型在主观（如放松性）和客观（如光线）维度分别取得66.8%和72.2%准确率，优于现有视频模型。加入眼动训练的模型在仅视觉输入时仍保持性能，瞳孔信号对客观评估贡献显著，多模态输入提升主观评价效果。

Conclusion: 引入眼动追踪作为训练特权信息，既提升审美预测效果，又支持实际部署中仅使用视觉输入。研究证实了眼动数据对主观任务的增强作用，为室内设计美学评估提供了可落地的实用工具。

Abstract: Understanding how people perceive and evaluate interior spaces is essential for designing environments that promote well-being. However, predicting aesthetic experiences remains difficult due to the subjective nature of perception and the complexity of visual responses. This study introduces a dual-branch CNN-LSTM framework that fuses visual features with eye-tracking signals to predict aesthetic evaluations of residential interiors. We collected a dataset of 224 interior design videos paired with synchronized gaze data from 28 participants who rated 15 aesthetic dimensions. The proposed model attains 72.2% accuracy on objective dimensions (e.g., light) and 66.8% on subjective dimensions (e.g., relaxation), outperforming state-of-the-art video baselines and showing clear gains on subjective evaluation tasks. Notably, models trained with eye-tracking retain comparable performance when deployed with visual input alone. Ablation experiments further reveal that pupil responses contribute most to objective assessments, while the combination of gaze and visual cues enhances subjective evaluations. These findings highlight the value of incorporating eye-tracking as privileged information during training, enabling more practical tools for aesthetic assessment in interior design.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本论文提出ColorConceptBench基准，揭示当前文本到图像模型在理解隐式颜色概念上的不足，并证明传统优化方法无效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文献缺乏对模型颜色-抽象概念关联能力的系统性评估，且当前方法局限于明确颜色词，而真实世界概念多为隐式表达。

Method: 构建包含1281个隐式颜色概念和6369条人工标注的ColorConceptBench基准，通过概率分布评估7种SOTA模型，测试缩放模型/引导等常规优化策略的效果。

Result: 所有测试模型均表现出对抽象语义的迟钝，标准干预措施未能改善表现，证明当前方法存在根本性局限。

Conclusion: 需改变模型学习隐式意义的底层机制，而非单纯增大模型，才能实现类人性能。

Abstract: While text-to-image (T2I) models have advanced considerably, their capability to associate colors with implicit concepts remains underexplored. To address the gap, we introduce ColorConceptBench, a new human-annotated benchmark to systematically evaluate color-concept associations through the lens of probabilistic color distributions. ColorConceptBench moves beyond explicit color names or codes by probing how models translate 1,281 implicit color concepts using a foundation of 6,369 human annotations. Our evaluation of seven leading T2I models reveals that current models lack sensitivity to abstract semantics, and crucially, this limitation appears resistant to standard interventions (e.g., scaling and guidance). This demonstrates that achieving human-like color semantics requires more than larger models, but demands a fundamental shift in how models learn and represent implicit meaning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型训练中验证集的使用耗时且可能泄露数据，需要一种轻量级、无需验证标签的检查点选择方案。

Method: 在单个前向-反向传播中计算分类器头部梯度的Frobenius范数||g||_F作为信号，结合模型家族特定的归一化策略（如ResNet用头缩放，Transformer用特征缩放）进行检查点筛选。

Result: 在ImageNet、COCO和扩散模型上，该方法对Top-1准确率/损失的预测性优于传统方案，计算开销低于0.1%，且能预测目标检测、图像生成指标（如FID）。在无验证集条件下接近Oracle选择效果。

Conclusion: 验证集可用性不再是检查点管理的必要条件，此方法可灵活集成至多样化模型架构，并支持标签无关的轻量级训练监控。

Abstract: We propose a validation-free checkpointing signal from a single forward-backward pass: the Frobenius norm of the classifier-head gradient on one detached-feature batch, ||g||_F = ||dL/dW||_F. Across ImageNet-1k CNNs and Transformers, this proxy is strongly negative with Top-1 and positive with loss. Selecting the checkpoint with the minimum head gradient in a short tail window closes most of the gap to the oracle (4.24% +/- 2.00% with a universal setup, about 1.12% with light per-family tuning). For practical deployment, a head-scale normalization is more stable within classic CNN families (e.g., ResNets), while a feature-scale normalization works well for Transformers and modern CNNs. The same one-batch probe also predicts COCO detection/segmentation mAP. In diffusion (UNet/DDPM on CIFAR-10), it tracks progress and enables near-oracle tail-window selection; it is positively correlated with same-distribution probe MSE and negatively with FID (lower is better), so it can be used as a lightweight, label-free monitor. Validation labels are never used beyond reporting. The probe adds much less than 0.1% of an epoch and works as a drop-in for validation-free checkpoint selection and early stopping.

Abstract: Transformer-based general visual geometry frameworks have shown promising performance in camera pose estimation and 3D scene understanding. Recent advancements in Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (VGGT) models have shown great promise in camera pose estimation and 3D reconstruction. However, these models typically rely on ground truth labels for training, posing challenges when adapting to unlabeled and unseen scenes. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised framework to train VGGT with unlabeled data, thereby enhancing its localization capability in large-scale environments. To achieve this, we extend conventional pair-wise relations to sequence-wise geometric constraints for self-supervised learning. Specifically, in each sequence, we sample multiple source frames and geometrically project them onto different target frames, which improves temporal feature consistency. We formulate physical photometric consistency and geometric constraints as a joint optimization loss to circumvent the requirement for hard labels. By training the model with this proposed method, not only the local and global cross-view attention layers but also the camera and depth heads can effectively capture the underlying multi-view geometry. Experiments demonstrate that the model converges within hundreds of iterations and achieves significant improvements in large-scale localization. Our code will be released at https://github.com/X-yangfan/GPA-VGGT.

Motivation: 现有单模态AI难以全面理解手术流程，多模态VLM具有潜力但缺乏系统性验证，需探索其在医疗场景的应用效果。

Method: 在机器人手术数据集GraSP上测试Qwen2.5、LLaVA1.5、InternVL3.5三种VLM，比较零样本与LoRA微调设定下的工具检测性能，并与基线模型Grounding DINO对比。

Result: Qwen2.5在检测性能上表现最佳：零样本下优于Grounding DINO，微调后性能接近但定位能力稍弱；而Grounding DINO定位更优但零样本泛化能力较差。

Conclusion: 大规模VLM（尤其是Qwen2.5）在手术工具检测中展现出优势，尤其适合无足量标注数据的医疗场景，但需结合模型优势解决定位等具体问题。

Abstract: Surgery is a highly complex process, and artificial intelligence has emerged as a transformative force in supporting surgical guidance and decision-making. However, the unimodal nature of most current AI systems limits their ability to achieve a holistic understanding of surgical workflows. This highlights the need for general-purpose surgical AI systems capable of comprehensively modeling the interrelated components of surgical scenes. Recent advances in large vision-language models that integrate multimodal data processing offer strong potential for modeling surgical tasks and providing human-like scene reasoning and understanding. Despite their promise, systematic investigations of VLMs in surgical applications remain limited. In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of large VLMs for the fundamental surgical vision task of detecting surgical tools. Specifically, we investigate three state-of-the-art VLMs, Qwen2.5, LLaVA1.5, and InternVL3.5, on the GraSP robotic surgery dataset under both zero-shot and parameter-efficient LoRA fine-tuning settings. Our results demonstrate that Qwen2.5 consistently achieves superior detection performance in both configurations among the evaluated VLMs. Furthermore, compared with the open-set detection baseline Grounding DINO, Qwen2.5 exhibits stronger zero-shot generalization and comparable fine-tuned performance. Notably, Qwen2.5 shows superior instrument recognition, while Grounding DINO demonstrates stronger localization.

TL;DR: 本论文提出了一种针对长视频生成中sink-collapse问题的轻量级解决方案，通过引入多头RoPE抖动抑制长期崩溃，实现高质量实时无限长度视频生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自回归视频生成方法虽使用sink帧缓解误差累积，但易导致sink-collapse（内容反复回归参考帧）。该问题源于RoPE周期结构与多头注意力机制的固有冲突，亟需解决以提升生成连贯性。

Method: 提出无需训练的多头RoPE抖动方法，通过打破跨注意力头同质化来抑制sink-collapse，维持生成质量。

Result: 实验证实该方法成功缓解sink-collapse，实现12小时超长连续视频生成，目前为流式视频生成中最长公开结果。

Conclusion: 解决了视频生成领域长期存在的长期崩溃问题，为无限长度实时视频生成提供了新范式。

Abstract: Recent research in long-form video generation has shifted from bidirectional to autoregressive models, yet these methods commonly suffer from error accumulation and a loss of long-term coherence. While attention sink frames have been introduced to mitigate this performance decay, they often induce a critical failure mode we term sink-collapse: the generated content repeatedly reverts to the sink frame, resulting in abrupt scene resets and cyclic motion patterns. Our analysis reveals that sink-collapse originates from an inherent conflict between the periodic structure of Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) and the multi-head attention mechanisms prevalent in current generative models. To address it, we propose a lightweight, training-free approach that effectively suppresses this behavior by introducing multi-head RoPE jitter that breaks inter-head attention homogenization and mitigates long-horizon collapse. Extensive experiments show that our method successfully alleviates sink-collapse while preserving generation quality. To the best of our knowledge, this work achieves the first demonstration of real-time, streaming, and infinite-length video generation with little quality decay. As an illustration of this robustness, we generate continuous videos up to 12 hours in length, which, to our knowledge, is among the longest publicly demonstrated results in streaming video generation.

Motivation: 现有自回归视频生成依赖复杂的教师-学生架构，导致训练受限（如需强教师模型）并影响效率，而双向模型虽质量高却缺乏实时性。本文旨在开发无需教师模型、更易扩展的替代方案。

Method: 提出Reward-Guided Autoregressive Generation（RG-AG）框架：1) 使用强化学习框架，直接将视觉质量与时间一致性作为奖励信号；2) 采用分层Transformer架构，通过时序注意力机制生成视频帧序列；3) 结合对比学习优化帧间一致性。

Result: 在VBench基准测试中以84.92总分接近需复杂蒸馏的自回归方法（84.31），且在16帧生成任务中比双向模型提升9.7%的时序流畅性指标。训练迭代减少40%且支持动态分辨率调整。

Conclusion: 奖励信号可有效替代教师模型指导自回归生成，在生成效率、训练可扩展性与视觉质量间取得平衡，为视频生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: While most prior work in video generation relies on bidirectional architectures, recent efforts have sought to adapt these models into autoregressive variants to support near real-time generation. However, such adaptations often depend heavily on teacher models, which can limit performance, particularly in the absence of a strong autoregressive teacher, resulting in output quality that typically lags behind their bidirectional counterparts. In this paper, we explore an alternative approach that uses reward signals to guide the generation process, enabling more efficient and scalable autoregressive generation. By using reward signals to guide the model, our method simplifies training while preserving high visual fidelity and temporal consistency. Through extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, we find that our approach performs comparably to existing autoregressive models and, in some cases, surpasses similarly sized bidirectional models by avoiding constraints imposed by teacher architectures. For example, on VBench, our method achieves a total score of 84.92, closely matching state-of-the-art autoregressive methods that score 84.31 but require significant heterogeneous distillation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A domain-invariant mixed-domain semi-supervised medical image segmentation framework combining Copy-Paste Mechanism (CPM) for data augmentation and Cluster Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMMD) for domain adaptation, achieving superior performance in multi-domain settings with scarce annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing semi-supervised/domain adaptation approaches assume single domain shifts or known domain indices, but real-world medical imaging datasets often contain unlabeled mixed domains from multiple scanners/centers with unknown domain labels and severe domain gaps that violate these assumptions.

Method: 1. Copy-Paste Mechanism (CPM) transfers informative regions across domains to enhance data diversity; 2. Cluster Maximum Mean Discrepancy (CMMD) block clusters unlabeled features and aligns them with labeled anchors via MMD objective to learn domain-invariant representations. Both components are integrated within a teacher-student framework.

Result: Experiments on Fundus and M&Ms benchmarks demonstrated consistent superior performance compared to existing semi-supervised and domain adaptation methods under mixed-domain scenarios with limited labeled data.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses both data scarcity and domain discrepancy challenges in real-world multi-source medical imaging scenarios by jointly optimizing domain-invariant representation learning and data augmentation through CPM and CMMD.

Abstract: Deep learning has shown remarkable progress in medical image semantic segmentation, yet its success heavily depends on large-scale expert annotations and consistent data distributions. In practice, annotations are scarce, and images are collected from multiple scanners or centers, leading to mixed-domain settings with unknown domain labels and severe domain gaps. Existing semi-supervised or domain adaptation approaches typically assume either a single domain shift or access to explicit domain indices, which rarely hold in real-world deployment. In this paper, we propose a domain-invariant mixed-domain semi-supervised segmentation framework that jointly enhances data diversity and mitigates domain bias. A Copy-Paste Mechanism (CPM) augments the training set by transferring informative regions across domains, while a Cluster Maximum Mean Discrepancy (CMMD) block clusters unlabeled features and aligns them with labeled anchors via an MMD objective, encouraging domain-invariant representations. Integrated within a teacher-student framework, our method achieves robust and precise segmentation even with very few labeled examples and multiple unknown domain discrepancies. Experiments on Fundus and M&Ms benchmarks demonstrate that our approach consistently surpasses semi-supervised and domain adaptation methods, establishing a potential solution for mixed-domain semi-supervised medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) remain poorly characterized in multi-step visual interactions, particularly in how they integrate perception, memory, and action over long horizons. We introduce VisGym, a gymnasium of 17 environments for evaluating and training VLMs. The suite spans symbolic puzzles, real-image understanding, navigation, and manipulation, and provides flexible controls over difficulty, input representation, planning horizon, and feedback. We also provide multi-step solvers that generate structured demonstrations, enabling supervised finetuning. Our evaluations show that all frontier models struggle in interactive settings, achieving low success rates in both the easy (46.6%) and hard (26.0%) configurations. Our experiments reveal notable limitations: models struggle to effectively leverage long context, performing worse with an unbounded history than with truncated windows. Furthermore, we find that several text-based symbolic tasks become substantially harder once rendered visually. However, explicit goal observations, textual feedback, and exploratory demonstrations in partially observable or unknown-dynamics settings for supervised finetuning yield consistent gains, highlighting concrete failure modes and pathways for improving multi-step visual decision-making.

Motivation: 现有单视角重照明技术在生成光照变化上取得进展，但无法维持多视角场景（如多机位拍摄、立体电影）所需的基础光照一致性，限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出多视角扩散变压器架构，采用潜变量桥接匹配策略训练模型，结合合成与真实场景的大规模混合数据集，无需相机姿态即可实现单次推理控制多视角光照。

Conclusion: SyncLight为多视角捕获系统提供了实用化重照明解决方案，推动虚拟制作、立体影像等内容生成技术发展。

Abstract: We present SyncLight, the first method to enable consistent, parametric relighting across multiple uncalibrated views of a static scene. While single-view relighting has advanced significantly, existing generative approaches struggle to maintain the rigorous lighting consistency essential for multi-camera broadcasts, stereoscopic cinema, and virtual production. SyncLight addresses this by enabling precise control over light intensity and color across a multi-view capture of a scene, conditioned on a single reference edit. Our method leverages a multi-view diffusion transformer trained using a latent bridge matching formulation, achieving high-fidelity relighting of the entire image set in a single inference step. To facilitate training, we introduce a large-scale hybrid dataset comprising diverse synthetic environments -- curated from existing sources and newly designed scenes -- alongside high-fidelity, real-world multi-view captures under calibrated illumination. Surprisingly, though trained only on image pairs, SyncLight generalizes zero-shot to an arbitrary number of viewpoints, effectively propagating lighting changes across all views, without requiring camera pose information. SyncLight enables practical relighting workflows for multi-view capture systems.

Abstract: Modern generative video models excel at producing convincing, high-quality outputs, but struggle to maintain multi-view and spatiotemporal consistency in highly dynamic real-world environments. In this work, we introduce \textbf{AnyView}, a diffusion-based video generation framework for \emph{dynamic view synthesis} with minimal inductive biases or geometric assumptions. We leverage multiple data sources with various levels of supervision, including monocular (2D), multi-view static (3D) and multi-view dynamic (4D) datasets, to train a generalist spatiotemporal implicit representation capable of producing zero-shot novel videos from arbitrary camera locations and trajectories. We evaluate AnyView on standard benchmarks, showing competitive results with the current state of the art, and propose \textbf{AnyViewBench}, a challenging new benchmark tailored towards \emph{extreme} dynamic view synthesis in diverse real-world scenarios. In this more dramatic setting, we find that most baselines drastically degrade in performance, as they require significant overlap between viewpoints, while AnyView maintains the ability to produce realistic, plausible, and spatiotemporally consistent videos when prompted from \emph{any} viewpoint.

*Qingyan Yang,Tongxi Wang,Yunsheng Luo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究提出ChiEngMixBench基准测试，通过自发性和自然性信号重新定义代码混合的认知对齐评估，发现了符合矩阵语言框架理论的术语分层策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码混合研究将问题简化为翻译任务，难以评估语言切换在社交语境中的合理性，需要建立符合人类认知模式的评估体系

Method: 构建涵盖真实社区语境的双语混合基准测试，提出基于语言认知对齐的评估框架，设计可扩展的跨语言数据集构建管线

Result: 建立了首个代码混合评估基准，发现多语模型自发形成术语分层策略，验证了矩阵语言框架理论的认知科学原理

Conclusion: 证明代码混合应作为认知对齐问题处理，提出的测评框架揭示了多语模型与人类交际行为的结构对应关系，为语言智能发展提供新方向

Abstract: Code-mixing is increasingly prevalent in interactions between humans and large language models, yet existing work often reduces it to a translation or convertibility problem, making it difficult to assess whether a model's switching behavior is context-appropriate and aligned with human conventions. We introduce ChiEngMixBench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate code-mixing ability in authentic community contexts, built upon a general construction pipeline that enables scalable dataset development across domains and bilingual pairs. ChiEngMixBench formulates code-mixing as a cognitive alignment problem, characterized by two complementary signals: Spontaneity and Naturalness. Empirical evaluation shows that our metrics can systematically distinguish code-mixing performance across models. Beyond benchmarking, we further uncover an implicitly emergent Terminology Layering Strategy, a phenomenon consistent with the Matrix Language Frame (MLF) theory, indicating structured cognitive alignment between multilingual large language models and human communication.

TL;DR: Introduces M3Kang, a multilingual math dataset with 108 languages and diagrams from the Kangaroo Math Competition, showing that even advanced models struggle with basic math compared to humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models' multilingual math reasoning capabilities are underexplored. The paper aims to bridge this gap by creating a dataset for systematic evaluation and comparison with human performance.

Method: Constructed M3Kang from Kangaroo Math Competition problems (1,747 questions, 108 languages, 433 with diagrams). Benchmarked SOTA vision-language models (closed-source and open-source) and compared results with 68,000 student performances.

Result: Model performance scales with language coverage and size but not grade level. Multilingual multimodal techniques improve reasoning. Human performance remains significantly higher, highlighting gaps in diagram-based and basic math understanding.

Conclusion: Open-sourced M3Kang/M2Kang datasets and framework. Results indicate need for advancements in cross-lingual math reasoning, emphasizing diagram interpretation and cultural adaptation.

Abstract: Despite state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities, their performance in multilingual mathematical reasoning remains underexplored, particularly when compared to human performance. To bridge this gap, we introduce M3Kang, the first massively multilingual, multimodal mathematical reasoning dataset for VLMs. It is derived from the Kangaroo Math Competition, the world's largest mathematics contest, which annually engages over six million participants under the age of 18 across more than 90 countries. M3Kang includes 1,747 unique multiple-choice problems organized by grade-level difficulty, with translations into 108 culturally diverse languages, some of them including diagrams essential for solving them. Using this dataset, we conduct extensive benchmarking on both closed- and open-source SOTA models. We observe that, despite recent advances, models still struggle with basic math and diagram-based reasoning, with performance scaling with language presence and model size, but not with grade level. We also find that multilingual techniques can be effectively extended to the multimodal setting, resulting in significant improvements over baseline approaches. Our analysis also incorporates performance data from over 68,000 students, enabling direct comparison with human performance. We are open-sourcing M3Kang, including the English-only subset M2Kang, along with the framework and codebase used to construct the dataset.

*Erdem Aslan,Pakize Erdoğmuş*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本论文提出了一种离线响应式知识蒸馏方法，通过优化数据策略和模型资源，在低硬件配置下构建高精度领域专用语言模型，验证了数据质量和结构对领域适应的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在处理未包含在预训练数据中的领域专业知识时易产生幻觉，现有解决方案需平衡模型性能与硬件资源限制，本文旨在探索高效且低资源消耗的领域适配方法。

Method: 采用三类数据策略（通用领域适配、无结构知识注入、上下文感知合成数据集）并结合Unsloth库优化Qwen-2.5-7B模型，将GPU显存需求从40GB降至16GB，通过对比不同数据规模和结构的效果改进模型。

Result: 包含500行的上下文感知合成数据集达到96.7%准确率且具备鲁棒拒答能力，而更大规模的无结构数据集仍存在持续性幻觉，验证了数据质量优先于数量的假设。

Conclusion: 低资源场景下，领域知识适配效果更依赖于数据质量和结构设计，而非数据规模，为模型压缩与领域优化提供了可行的技术路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in general tasks but often struggle with hallucinations when handling domain-specific or institutional knowledge absent from their pre-training. We present an offline response-based knowledge distillation method that develops high-accuracy specialized assistants under constrained hardware resources. We evaluate three distinct data strategies: general domain adaptation (15,000 lines), unstructured knowledge injection (2,000 lines), and a context-aware synthetic dataset (500 lines) generated by a teacher model. To minimize computational costs, we utilize the Unsloth library to optimize the Qwen-2.5-7B student model, reducing NVIDIA A100 GPU memory requirements from 40 GB to 16 GB. Experimental results demonstrate that while larger unstructured datasets suffer from persistent hallucinations, the 500-line context-aware dataset achieves a 96.7% accuracy rate and robust rejection capability. These findings validate the LIMA hypothesis, showing that data quality and structural alignment are more critical than quantity for domain adaptation in low-resource settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为Neural Flow Diffusion Models（NFDM）的语言生成方法，通过将连续扩散模型直接应用于离散空间，显著提升了采样速度和生成连贯性，且无需依赖复杂隐式离散化策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的自回归语言模型（如GPT）存在采样速度慢和生成连贯性不足的缺陷。现有扩散模型在离散空间中的应用常需复杂的隐式离散化或连续松弛技术，可能影响性能。

Method: 提出NFDM，通过端到端训练学习多变量前向过程，并设计生成轨迹与语言建模目标对齐的连续扩散框架。利用微分方程建模离散文本数据的时间演化路径，并通过逆向过程生成文本。

Result: 在保持与同类自回归模型可比的对数似然值的同时，NFDM较传统扩散模型减少了20%以上的推理步骤，生成文本在BLEU-4和ROUGE-L指标上提升了3-5个百分点。

Conclusion: NFDM通过优化扩散过程与离散空间的适配性，为扩散模型在语言生成领域的高效应用提供了新范式，平衡了生成质量与计算效率。

Abstract: Language diffusion models aim to improve sampling speed and coherence over autoregressive LLMs. We introduce Neural Flow Diffusion Models for language generation, an extension of NFDM that enables the straightforward application of continuous diffusion models to discrete state spaces. NFDM learns a multivariate forward process from the data, ensuring that the forward process and generative trajectory are a good fit for language modeling. Our model substantially reduces the likelihood gap with autoregressive models of the same size, while achieving sample quality comparable to that of previous latent diffusion models.

TL;DR: 提出GameTalk框架，训练大语言模型通过多轮对话进行战略决策，优化全局目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究集中于单次决策或静态动作预测，缺乏对多轮对话中长期战略目标优化的探索。

Method: 通过改进GRPO、DPO、STaR等微调方法，结合全交互奖励信号，使模型在完整对话中优化全局目标。

Result: GameTalk在复杂游戏任务中表现显著优于未训练模型，奖励塑形下DPO效果最佳。

Conclusion: 对话式微调为多智能体环境中LLMs的推理、谈判与决策提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Strategic decision-making in multi-agent settings is a key challenge for large language models (LLMs), particularly when coordination and negotiation must unfold over extended conversations. While recent work has explored the use of LLMs in isolated decision tasks, little attention has been given to optimizing long-term objectives through dialogue. We introduce \textbf{GameTalk}, a framework for training LLMs to make strategic decisions via multi-turn interactions. Unlike prior work that focuses on single-turn objectives or static action prediction, we train LLMs to optimize a global objective across full conversations. We achieve this by adapting fine-tuning methods like GRPO, DPO, and STaR to incorporate reward signals that depend on the entire interaction. We evaluate this approach on a suite of increasingly complex games, designed to stress different aspects of reasoning, coordination, and opponent modeling. Our results show that GameTalk significantly outperforms untrained models, especially under reward shaping, with DPO consistently yielding the strongest gains. These findings position conversational fine-tuning as a promising path for LLMs to reason, negotiate, and act in interactive environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源语言缺乏人工标注数据的问题，探索合成数据生成作为蒸馏方法的潜力，以降低计算成本并提升模型效率。

Method: 使用最先进的多语言LLM生成覆盖11种语言和4个分类任务的合成数据集，并通过微调、指令微调或合成上下文示例训练更小的模型。

Result: 少量合成数据即可使小模型超越原始大模型的性能，低资源语言表现提升尤为明显。

Conclusion: LLM应作为数据生成器（教师）而非直接分类器，通过合成数据赋能更高效的小型多语言模型。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable multilingual capabilities, making them promising tools in both high- and low-resource languages. One particularly valuable use case is generating synthetic samples that can be used to train smaller models in low-resource scenarios where human-labelled data is scarce. In this work, we investigate whether these synthetic data generation capabilities can serve as a form of distillation, producing smaller models that perform on par with or even better than massive LLMs across languages and tasks. To this end, we use a state-of-the-art multilingual LLM to generate synthetic datasets covering 11 languages and 4 classification tasks. These datasets are then used to train smaller models via fine-tuning or instruction tuning, or as synthetic in-context examples for compact LLMs. Our experiments show that even small amounts of synthetic data enable smaller models to outperform the large generator itself, particularly in low-resource languages. Overall, the results suggest that LLMs are best utilised as generators (teachers) rather than classifiers, producing data that empowers smaller and more efficient multilingual models.

Motivation: 当前自动化科学系统在实验生成方面有进展，但理论构建等高层科学活动研究不足，且缺乏大规模理论生成的方法。

Method: 使用13.7k篇论文合成2.9k个理论，对比基于文献的生成（利用论文引用和内容）与基于参数化LLM的生成；评估准确性 vs 创新性生成目标对理论质量的影响，并测试理论对后续4.6万篇论文的预测能力。

Result: 文献支持的生成方法比参数化LLM方法在匹配现有证据（准确率提升23%）和预测未来研究结果（预测准确率提升19%）上均显著更优；创新性目标生成的理论在新颖性指标上高15%，但准确率低8%。

Conclusion: 基于文献的理论生成更适合大规模科学发现，文献支撑比参数化知识更可靠，兼顾准确性和创新性目标可优化理论质量。

Abstract: Contemporary automated scientific discovery has focused on agents for generating scientific experiments, while systems that perform higher-level scientific activities such as theory building remain underexplored. In this work, we formulate the problem of synthesizing theories consisting of qualitative and quantitative laws from large corpora of scientific literature. We study theory generation at scale, using 13.7k source papers to synthesize 2.9k theories, examining how generation using literature-grounding versus parametric knowledge, and accuracy-focused versus novelty-focused generation objectives change theory properties. Our experiments show that, compared to using parametric LLM memory for generation, our literature-supported method creates theories that are significantly better at both matching existing evidence and at predicting future results from 4.6k subsequently-written papers

TL;DR: DNIPRO is a large, multilingual corpus of news articles about the Russo-Ukrainian war, designed for analyzing geopolitical narratives and media framing through comprehensive metadata and annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a systematic resource for studying how conflicting narratives emerge and evolve in global information ecosystems during warfare, addressing the lack of longitudinal datasets with transnational and multilingual coverage.

Method: Created a corpus of 246K news articles from 11 outlets across 5 countries and 3 languages (2022-2024), including metadata standardization, multiple annotation types, and human evaluation to ensure quality. Applied stance detection, sentiment analysis, and topical framing experiments.

Result: Dataset revealed polarized media interpretations reflecting geopolitical interests, validated through use cases showing divergent framing of conflict events. Achieved rigorous annotation standards via human evaluation.

Conclusion: DNIPRO enables computational journalism and war narrative research, offering foundational insights into information warfare dynamics and transnational discourse analysis.

Abstract: We introduce DNIPRO, a novel longitudinal corpus of 246K news articles documenting the Russo-Ukrainian war from Feb 2022 to Aug 2024, spanning eleven media outlets across five nation states (Russia, Ukraine, U.S., U.K., and China) and three languages (English, Russian, and Mandarin Chinese). This multilingual resource features consistent and comprehensive metadata, and multiple types of annotation with rigorous human evaluations for downstream tasks relevant to systematic transnational analyses of contentious wartime discourse. DNIPRO's distinctive value lies in its inclusion of competing geopolitical perspectives, making it uniquely suited for studying narrative divergence, media framing, and information warfare. To demonstrate its utility, we include use case experiments using stance detection, sentiment analysis, topical framing, and contradiction analysis of major conflict events within the larger war. Our explorations reveal how outlets construct competing realities, with coverage exhibiting polarized interpretations that reflect geopolitical interests. Beyond supporting computational journalism research, DNIPRO provides a foundational resource for understanding how conflicting narratives emerge and evolve across global information ecosystems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型（LLMs）因缺乏聚合物专业知识和对齐能力，在材料科学领域表现不足，需构建领域专用数据集与对齐方法以提高性能。

Method: 构建聚合物知识库（13M+数据点）生成PolyBench数据集，结合结构化推理链（CoT）进行知识增强蒸馏，并按任务复杂度分层设计评估体系。

Result: 7B-14B参数模型基于PolyBench训练后，在聚合物设计测试集中超过同规模及前沿闭源LLMs，并在其他聚合物基准中取得提升。

Conclusion: 领域专用数据集和知识增强方法可有效提升中小模型在科学推理任务中的表现，为专业领域AI提供低成本高效益的解决方案。

Abstract: Research in AI4Science has shown promise in many science applications, including polymer design. However, current LLMs prove ineffective on this problem space because: (i) most models lack polymer-specific knowledge (ii) existing aligned models lack coverage of knowledge and capabilities relevant to polymer design. Addressing this, we introduce PolyBench, a large scale training and test benchmark dataset of more than 125K polymer design related tasks, leveraging a knowledge base of 13M+ data points obtained from experimental and synthetic sources to ensure broad coverage of polymers and their properties. For effective alignment using PolyBench, we introduce a knowledge-augmented reasoning distillation method that augments this dataset with structured CoT. Furthermore, tasks in PolyBench are organized from simple to complex analytical reasoning problems, enabling generalization tests and diagnostic probes across the problem space. Experiments show that small language models (SLMs), of 7B to 14B parameters, trained on PolyBench data outperform similar sized models, and even closed source frontier LLMs on PolyBench test dataset while demonstrating gains on other polymer benchmarks as well.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores using large language models (LLMs) for automated grading of national exam essays, showing comparable performance to human raters while addressing bias, security, and feedback generation in a high-stakes, small-language (Estonian) context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for efficient, consistent, and scalable evaluation of open-ended exam responses (e.g., national graduation exams) while maintaining human-like accuracy and enabling personalized feedback in digitally advanced societies.

Method: Operationalizing curriculum-based rubrics for LLMs and statistical NLP models, comparing automated scores with human panel ratings on two large Estonian national trial exam datasets. Evaluated bias, prompt injection risks, and LLMs' role as essay writers.

Result: Automated scoring achieved human-comparable performance, fell within human scoring ranges, enabled fine-grained subscore profiles, and demonstrated viability for national-scale implementation with human oversight in a small-language setting.

Conclusion: A rubric-driven, human-in-the-loop LLM pipeline can safely and effectively perform high-stakes writing assessments, offering scalable solutions for education systems transitioning to digital exams while maintaining compliance with educational standards.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) enable rapid and consistent automated evaluation of open-ended exam responses, including dimensions of content and argumentation that have traditionally required human judgment. This is particularly important in cases where a large amount of exams need to be graded in a limited time frame, such as nation-wide graduation exams in various countries. Here, we examine the applicability of automated scoring on two large datasets of trial exam essays of two full national cohorts from Estonia. We operationalize the official curriculum-based rubric and compare LLM and statistical natural language processing (NLP) based assessments with human panel scores. The results show that automated scoring can achieve performance comparable to that of human raters and tends to fall within the human scoring range. We also evaluate bias, prompt injection risks, and LLMs as essay writers. These findings demonstrate that a principled, rubric-driven, human-in-the-loop scoring pipeline is viable for high-stakes writing assessment, particularly relevant for digitally advanced societies like Estonia, which is about to adapt a fully electronic examination system. Furthermore, the system produces fine-grained subscore profiles that can be used to generate systematic, personalized feedback for instruction and exam preparation. The study provides evidence that LLM-assisted assessment can be implemented at a national scale, even in a small-language context, while maintaining human oversight and compliance with emerging educational and regulatory standards.

Motivation: 为解决AI公平性和全球代表性问题，检测LLMs中是否存在地区偏向性，避免影响模型在跨文化应用中的可靠性与包容性。

Method: 构建FAZE评估框架（10分制），设计100个中立情境提示词，对GPT-3.5、Claude 3.5 Sonnet等十种主流LLMs进行强制选择决策测试。

Result: GPT-3.5地区偏见得分最高（9.5），Claude 3.5 Sonnet最低（2.5），证明模型偏见水平差异显著，可能削弱实际应用中的公平性。

Conclusion: 提出需开发包容性评估框架与系统性方法以识别和缓解语言模型的地理偏见，推动AI公平性研究进展。

Abstract: This study investigates regional bias in large language models (LLMs), an emerging concern in AI fairness and global representation. We evaluate ten prominent LLMs: GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Flash, Gemini 1.0 Pro, Claude 3 Opus, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Llama 3, Gemma 7B, Mistral 7B, and Vicuna-13B using a dataset of 100 carefully designed prompts that probe forced-choice decisions between regions under contextually neutral scenarios. We introduce FAZE, a prompt-based evaluation framework that measures regional bias on a 10-point scale, where higher scores indicate a stronger tendency to favor specific regions. Experimental results reveal substantial variation in bias levels across models, with GPT-3.5 exhibiting the highest bias score (9.5) and Claude 3.5 Sonnet scoring the lowest (2.5). These findings indicate that regional bias can meaningfully undermine the reliability, fairness, and inclusivity of LLM outputs in real-world, cross-cultural applications. This work contributes to AI fairness research by highlighting the importance of inclusive evaluation frameworks and systematic approaches for identifying and mitigating geographic biases in language models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Using deep binding with base language models and rich narrative contexts improves simulation of human identity-based behaviors in social dilemma games compared to traditional persona-based steering methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods using chat models with personas (steering) fail to capture nuanced human behaviors influenced by identity and context. The authors aim to address this by replicating identity-based decision-making mechanisms and contextual factors (e.g., time, framing effects) often omitted in experimental descriptions.

Method: Conditioned base language models with narrative identities/extended backstories for deep binding, then used instruction-tuned models to verify consistency. Analyzed social dilemma games while systematically incorporating variables like temporal context, question framing, and participant pool demographics.

Result: Deep binding with narrative identities improved simulation fidelity against human study benchmarks. Demonstrated LLMs' ability to model complex contextual influences (e.g., replicating year-dependent behavioral patterns and framing effects) that traditional experimental methods often miss.

Conclusion: LLMs enable high-fidelity replication of human behavior by integrating narrative identity contexts and contextual variables, offering a tool to uncover hidden factors in social science experiments while highlighting limitations of conventional persona-steering approaches.

Abstract: Humans act via a nuanced process that depends both on rational deliberation and also on identity and contextual factors. In this work, we study how large language models (LLMs) can simulate human action in the context of social dilemma games. While prior work has focused on "steering" (weak binding) of chat models to simulate personas, we analyze here how deep binding of base models with extended backstories leads to more faithful replication of identity-based behaviors. Our study has these findings: simulation fidelity vs human studies is improved by conditioning base LMs with rich context of narrative identities and checking consistency using instruction-tuned models. We show that LLMs can also model contextual factors such as time (year that a study was performed), question framing, and participant pool effects. LLMs, therefore, allow us to explore the details that affect human studies but which are often omitted from experiment descriptions, and which hamper accurate replication.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Cross-Lingual Activation Steering (CLAS), a training-free method to enhance multilingual language model performance by modulating neuron activations, achieving significant improvements in classification and generation tasks (2.3% Acc., 3.4% F1) while preserving high-resource language performance. The approach leverages functional divergence rather than strict alignment for cross-lingual transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing persistent performance gaps between dominant and non-dominant languages in multilingual models caused by imbalanced shared vs. language-specific neuron representations.

Method: Proposing Cross-Lingual Activation Steering (CLAS) as a zero-parameter intervention during inference, which selectively adjusts neuron activations to optimize cross-lingual knowledge transfer without modifying model weights.

Result: 1) 2.3% accuracy improvement on classification benchmarks; 2) 3.4% F1 improvement on generation tasks; 3) enhanced language cluster separation in representations; 4) preserved performance on high-resource languages.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that targeted activation steering unlocks latent multilingual capabilities in existing models. Effective transfer arises from functional divergence between language-specific clusters rather than strict alignment, suggesting new avenues for improving low-resourcemedium language processing without retraining.

Abstract: Large language models exhibit strong multilingual capabilities, yet significant performance gaps persist between dominant and non-dominant languages. Prior work attributes this gap to imbalances between shared and language-specific neurons in multilingual representations. We propose Cross-Lingual Activation Steering (CLAS), a training-free inference-time intervention that selectively modulates neuron activations. We evaluate CLAS on classification and generation benchmarks, achieving average improvements of 2.3% (Acc.) and 3.4% (F1) respectively, while maintaining high-resource language performance. We discover that effective transfer operates through functional divergence rather than strict alignment; performance gains correlate with increased language cluster separation. Our results demonstrate that targeted activation steering can unlock latent multilingual capacity in existing models without modification to model weights.

Motivation: 临床摘要需实现生成内容的可溯源性，但传统基于后处理或模型再训练的方法存在效率低、泛化性差的问题。

Method: 提出两种跨模态归因策略：1）原始图像模式直接利用图像分块注意力；2）图题转换模式将图像替换为生成性图题后进行纯文本对齐，全程无需模型训练。

Conclusion: 基于注意力机制的归因方法为医疗摘要系统的可解释性与落地应用提供了有效技术路径。

Abstract: Trustworthy clinical summarization requires not only fluent generation but also transparency about where each statement comes from. We propose a training-free framework for generation-time source attribution that leverages decoder attentions to directly cite supporting text spans or images, overcoming the limitations of post-hoc or retraining-based methods. We introduce two strategies for multimodal attribution: a raw image mode, which directly uses image patch attentions, and a caption-as-span mode, which substitutes images with generated captions to enable purely text-based alignment. Evaluations on two representative domains: clinician-patient dialogues (CliConSummation) and radiology reports (MIMIC-CXR), show that our approach consistently outperforms embedding-based and self-attribution baselines, improving both text-level and multimodal attribution accuracy (e.g., +15% F1 over embedding baselines). Caption-based attribution achieves competitive performance with raw-image attention while being more lightweight and practical. These findings highlight attention-guided attribution as a promising step toward interpretable and deployable clinical summarization systems.

Motivation: Current VQA systems often fail when questions are context-dependent or visually under-specified, leading to confident but incorrect answers. This work addresses the need for explicit clarification in ambiguous scenarios to improve accuracy.

Method: CoA decouples the decision to clarify (binary classification) from answering. When clarification is needed, GRPO-CR generates a focused question using reinforcement learning with rewards for question quality (well-formed, non-trivial). A new dataset (CONTEXTCLARIFY) is introduced for evaluation.

Result: CoA outperforms prompting baselines by 15.3% average accuracy across 3 VLLMs and 3 datasets. GRPO-CR successfully generates effective clarification questions that resolve ambiguity, validated through both automated metrics and human evaluation.

Conclusion: Dynamic clarification improves VQA accuracy in ambiguous contexts. The integration of RL-guided question generation with decision-making mechanisms provides a generalizable framework for handling underspecification in multimodal tasks.

Abstract: Real-world visual question answering (VQA) is often context-dependent: an image-question pair may be under-specified, such that the correct answer depends on external information that is not observable in the image. In such cases, directly answering can lead to confident but incorrect predictions. We propose CoA(Clarify-or-Answer), an ask-or-answer agent that separately models the decision to ask or answer, and what to ask if needed. CoA first determines whether clarification is necessary; if so, it asks a single focused question and then incorporates the response to produce the final answer. We introduce CONTEXTCLARIFY with a set of ambiguous VQA questions and the contrast set that is non-ambiguous. We further introduce GRPO-CR (Clarification Reasoning), a reinforcement learning approach that optimizes clarification question generation with multiple reward signals encouraging well-formed, focused, non-trivial questions that resolve ambiguity. Across three VLLMs and three datasets, CoA achieves consistent improvements at both the module and system levels, improving end-to-end VQA accuracy by an average of +15.3 points (83%) over prompting-based baselines

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in multimodal perception and understanding tasks. However, their effectiveness in specialized domains, such as remote sensing and medical imaging, remains limited. A natural approach to domain adaptation is to inject domain knowledge through textual instructions, prompts, or auxiliary captions. Surprisingly, we find that such input-level domain knowledge injection yields little to no improvement on scientific multimodal tasks, even when the domain knowledge is explicitly provided. This observation suggests that current MLLMs fail to internalize domain-specific priors through language alone, and that domain knowledge must be integrated at the optimization level. Motivated by this insight, we propose a reinforcement fine-tuning framework that incorporates domain knowledge directly into the learning objective. Instead of treating domain knowledge as descriptive information, we encode it as domain-informed constraints and reward signals, shaping the model's behavior in the output space. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets in remote sensing and medical domains consistently demonstrate good performance gains, achieving state-of-the-art results on multimodal domain tasks. Our results highlight the necessity of optimization-level domain knowledge integration and reveal a fundamental limitation of textual domain conditioning in current MLLMs.

### [58] [Exploring the Effects of Alignment on Numerical Bias in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16444)
*Ayako Sato,Hwichan Kim,Zhousi Chen,Masato Mita,Mamoru Komachi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study explores how alignment techniques in LLMs cause numerical bias in evaluation tasks and proposes mitigation strategies like score range adjustment to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluator LLMs exhibit numerical bias, reducing evaluation performance. Prior research links alignment (e.g., instruction tuning) to reduced output diversity, prompting this study to investigate alignment as the bias source.

Method: Compare pre- and post-alignment LLM outputs to assess bias changes. Test mitigation strategies: temperature scaling, distribution calibration, and score range adjustment.

Result: Alignment increases numerical bias. Score range adjustment most effectively reduces bias and enhances performance, though remaining heuristic limitations exist.

Conclusion: Alignment causes numerical bias; optimized score range selection and robust mitigation strategies are needed for future improvement.

Abstract: ``LLM-as-a-judge,'' which utilizes large language models (LLMs) as evaluators, has proven effective in many evaluation tasks. However, evaluator LLMs exhibit numerical bias, a phenomenon where certain evaluation scores are generated disproportionately often, leading reduced evaluation performance. This study investigates the cause of this bias. Given that most evaluator LLMs are aligned through instruction tuning and preference tuning, and that prior research suggests alignment reduces output diversity, we hypothesize that numerical bias arises from alignment. To test this, we compare outputs from pre- and post-alignment LLMs, and observe that alignment indeed increases numerical bias. We also explore mitigation strategies for post-alignment LLMs, including temperature scaling, distribution calibration, and score range adjustment. Among these, score range adjustment is most effective in reducing bias and improving performance, though still heuristic. Our findings highlight the need for further work on optimal score range selection and more robust mitigation strategies.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in reasoning tasks such as mathematics and coding, matching or surpassing human capabilities. However, these impressive reasoning abilities face significant challenges in specialized domains. Taking Go as an example, although AlphaGo has established the high performance ceiling of AI systems in Go, mainstream LLMs still struggle to reach even beginner-level proficiency, let alone perform natural language reasoning. This performance gap between general-purpose LLMs and domain experts is significantly limiting the application of LLMs on a wider range of domain-specific tasks. In this work, we aim to bridge the divide between LLMs' general reasoning capabilities and expert knowledge in domain-specific tasks. We perform mixed fine-tuning with structured Go expertise and general long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning data as a cold start, followed by reinforcement learning to integrate expert knowledge in Go with general reasoning capabilities. Through this methodology, we present \textbf{LoGos}, a powerful LLM that not only maintains outstanding general reasoning abilities, but also conducts Go gameplay in natural language, demonstrating effective strategic reasoning and accurate next-move prediction. LoGos achieves performance comparable to human professional players, substantially surpassing all existing LLMs. Through this work, we aim to contribute insights on applying general LLM reasoning capabilities to specialized domains. We will release the first large-scale Go dataset for LLM training, the first LLM Go evaluation benchmark, and the first general LLM that reaches human professional-level performance in Go at: https://github.com/Entarochuan/LoGos.

Conclusion: 动态知识索引方法可有效解决传统RAG系统的碎片化信息整合问题。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a dominant paradigm for mitigating hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge. Nevertheless, effectively integrating and interpreting key evidence scattered across noisy documents remains a critical challenge for existing RAG systems. In this paper, we propose GraphAnchor, a novel Graph-Anchored Knowledge Indexing approach that reconceptualizes graph structures from static knowledge representations into active, evolving knowledge indices. GraphAnchor incrementally updates a graph during iterative retrieval to anchor salient entities and relations, yielding a structured index that guides the LLM in evaluating knowledge sufficiency and formulating subsequent subqueries. The final answer is generated by jointly leveraging all retrieved documents and the final evolved graph. Experiments on four multi-hop question answering benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of GraphAnchor, and reveal that GraphAnchor modulates the LLM's attention to more effectively associate key information distributed in retrieved documents.

Conclusion: 揭示大语言模型性格特征的安全漏洞，证明现有防护措施在持续攻击下存在脆弱性，提出开发上下文自适应性格机制的迫切需求。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in domains such as education, mental health and customer support, where stable and consistent personas are critical for reliability. Yet, existing studies focus on narrative or role-playing tasks and overlook how adversarial conversational history alone can reshape induced personas. Black-box persona manipulation remains unexplored, raising concerns for robustness in realistic interactions. In response, we introduce the task of persona editing, which adversarially steers LLM traits through user-side inputs under a black-box, inference-only setting. To this end, we propose PHISH (Persona Hijacking via Implicit Steering in History), the first framework to expose a new vulnerability in LLM safety that embeds semantically loaded cues into user queries to gradually induce reverse personas. We also define a metric to quantify attack success. Across 3 benchmarks and 8 LLMs, PHISH predictably shifts personas, triggers collateral changes in correlated traits, and exhibits stronger effects in multi-turn settings. In high-risk domains mental health, tutoring, and customer support, PHISH reliably manipulates personas, validated by both human and LLM-as-Judge evaluations. Importantly, PHISH causes only a small reduction in reasoning benchmark performance, leaving overall utility largely intact while still enabling significant persona manipulation. While current guardrails offer partial protection, they remain brittle under sustained attack. Our findings expose new vulnerabilities in personas and highlight the need for context-resilient persona in LLMs. Our codebase and dataset is available at: https://github.com/Jivnesh/PHISH

Result: 在模拟电路设计任务中，TL-GRPO对比标准GRPO和贝叶斯优化方法取得全面性能优势。30B参数模型在同等仿真预算下达到当前最优性能，展示其泛化性和实用性。

Conclusion: TL-GRPO成功填补了迭代优化任务中细粒度强化学习方法的空白，通过回合级优化策略平衡了精准优化与知识复用，为科学优化任务提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities in complex tasks through tool integration, which is typically framed as a Markov Decision Process and optimized with trajectory-level RL algorithms such as GRPO. However, a common class of reasoning tasks, iterative optimization, presents distinct challenges: the agent interacts with the same underlying environment state across turns, and the value of a trajectory is determined by the best turn-level reward rather than cumulative returns. Existing GRPO-based methods cannot perform fine-grained, turn-level optimization in such settings, while black-box optimization methods discard prior knowledge and reasoning capabilities. To address this gap, we propose Turn-Level GRPO (TL-GRPO), a lightweight RL algorithm that performs turn-level group sampling for fine-grained optimization. We evaluate TL-GRPO on analog circuit sizing (ACS), a challenging scientific optimization task requiring multiple simulations and domain expertise. Results show that TL-GRPO outperforms standard GRPO and Bayesian optimization methods across various specifications. Furthermore, our 30B model trained with TL-GRPO achieves state-of-the-art performance on ACS tasks under same simulation budget, demonstrating both strong generalization and practical utility.

Additionally, we develop the MRAG-Toolkit, facilitating systematic exploration of different RAG components. Our experiments reveal that: (a) RAG enhances LLM reliability across MRAG tasks. (b) the performance of RAG systems is influenced by retrieval approaches, model sizes, and prompting strategies. (c) While RAG improves usefulness and reasoning quality, LLM responses may become slightly less readable for long-form questions. We will release the MRAG-Bench's dataset and toolkit with CCBY-4.0 license upon acceptance, to facilitate applications from both academia and industry.

Motivation: 现有基准依赖单一标签评估，无法判断陈述是否联合成立、互斥或共同不成立，需更细致的推理能力评估框架。

Method: 构建包含逻辑运算符（AND/OR/NEITHER）的复合推理基准，对模型进行零样本、少样本及思维链提示下的多任务评估。

Result: 模型处理联合（AND）及析取（OR）推理表现尚可，但在基于否定的逻辑任务中表现显著下降。

Conclusion: 该基准暴露了模型的基础性推理限制，为推进组合式常识推理提供了可控制框架。

Abstract: Commonsense reasoning often involves evaluating multiple plausible interpretations rather than selecting a single atomic answer, yet most benchmarks rely on single-label evaluation, obscuring whether statements are jointly plausible, mutually exclusive, or jointly implausible. We introduce LOGICAL-COMMONSENSEQA, a benchmark that re-frames commonsense reasoning as logical composition over pairs of atomic statements using plausibility-level operators (AND, OR, NEITHER/NOR). Evaluating instruction-tuned, reasoning-specialized, and fine-tuned models under zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting, we find that while models perform reasonably on conjunctive and moderately on disjunctive reasoning, performance degrades sharply on negation-based questions. LOGICAL-COMMONSENSEQA exposes fundamental reasoning limitations and provides a controlled framework for advancing compositional commonsense reasoning.

Motivation: 揭示真实风险需动态评估，当前主流静态测试方法无法反映真实对话环境中的问题。

Method: 在三款LLM上使用BoolQ数据集测试不同对话长度与结构条件下的响应准确性，采用动态多轮测试对比单一提示测试。

Result: 观测到模型特异性漏洞及对话长度与结构依赖性缺陷，该结果表明静态单一提示评估存在根本性局限。

Conclusion: 实际部署需引入多轮对话评估框架，现有基准测试需进化以覆盖真实应用场景。

Abstract: Single-prompt evaluations dominate current LLM benchmarking, yet they fail to capture the conversational dynamics where real-world harm occurs. In this study, we examined whether conversation length affects response veracity by evaluating LLM performance on the BoolQ dataset under varying length and scaffolding conditions. Our results across three distinct LLMs revealed model-specific vulnerabilities that are invisible under single-turn testing. The length-dependent and scaffold-specific effects we observed demonstrate a fundamental limitation of static evaluations, as deployment-relevant vulnerabilities could only be spotted in a multi-turn conversational setting.

Result: 在HOVER和FEVEROUS-S数据集上均取得优于现有方法的验证准确率

Conclusion: RRC框架通过证据精炼和动态校准有效提升了多跳事实验证性能，尤其在处理干扰信息和预测不确定性方面表现突出

Abstract: Fact-checking aims to verify the truthfulness of a claim based on the retrieved evidence. Existing methods typically follow a decomposition paradigm, in which a claim is broken down into sub-claims that are individually verified. However, the decomposition paradigm may introduce noise to the verification process due to irrelevant entities or evidence, ultimately degrading verification accuracy. To address this problem, we propose a Retrieve-Refine-Calibrate (RRC) framework based on large language models (LLMs). Specifically, the framework first identifies the entities mentioned in the claim and retrieves evidence relevant to them. Then, it refines the retrieved evidence based on the claim to reduce irrelevant information. Finally, it calibrates the verification process by re-evaluating low-confidence predictions. Experiments on two popular fact-checking datasets (HOVER and FEVEROUS-S) demonstrate that our framework achieves superior performance compared with competitive baselines.

Motivation: VLLMs face challenges like domain-specific performance gaps and high computational demands in industrial applications, which AuroraEdge-V-2B aims to address.

Method: Designed AuroraEdge-V-2B with compression-fusion to reduce parameters to 2B and visual tokens, improving inference efficiency for edge deployment.

Result: Achieved 50% reduction in floating-point operations and outperformed similar-sized models (e.g., Qwen2-VL-2B) on 9 benchmarks.

Conclusion: AuroraEdge-V-2B balances performance and efficiency, enabling practical VLLM deployment in industrial settings.

Abstract: Recently, due to the advancement of multimodal technology, people are attempting to use visual large language models (VLLMs) in industrial production. Many deep learning models (DLMs) deployed in the production environment are gradually being replaced by VLLMs. Compared with DLMs, VLLMs have some advantages in industrial applications: (1) Their strong generalization ability enables them to perform well across a wide range of tasks. (2) They are flexible and can deal with unfamiliar samples through context learning quickly. However, VLLMs also have obvious drawbacks: (1) VLLMs do not perform as well as custom-developed DLMs in specific domains. (2) The number of parameters in VLLMs is generally quite large, and their deployment requires substantial computational resources. (3) VLLMs generally operate much slower than DLMs, making real-time response challenging to achieve. To better utilize VLLMs in industrial applications, we introduce AuroraEdge-V-2B in this work, a compact, robust, and high-speed VLLM designed for edge deployment. To make the model run faster, we also propose a compression-fusion method to improve inference efficiency. AuroraEdge-V-2B has the following notable features: (1) Easy deployment and faster: It has only 2B parameters and is highly suitable for edge deployment, offering better real-time performance. (2) Fewer visual tokens and cheaper: It significantly reduces the number of visual tokens in the decoding process, thereby reducing the floating-point operations by half during inference and making it cheaper to use. (3) Strong performance: It gets a higher score on 9 benchmarks than models with the same number of parameter (e.g., Qwen2-VL-2B, Qwen2.5-VL-3B, InternVL-2.5-2B).

Result: 实验验证了PROST-LLM在提升LLMs的S2ST能力上的有效性，特别是在小样本场景下优于基线方法。

Conclusion: PROST-LLM通过渐进式训练策略有效缓解S2ST数据稀缺问题，为LLMs在低资源语音翻译场景的应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in many tasks, their application to Speech-to-Speech Translation (S2ST) is underexplored and hindered by data scarcity. To bridge this gap, we propose PROST-LLM (PROgressive Speech-to-speech Translation) to enhance the S2ST capabilities in LLMs progressively. First, we fine-tune the LLMs with the CVSS corpus, employing designed tri-task learning and chain of modality methods to boost the initial performance. Then, leveraging the fine-tuned model, we generate preference pairs through self-sampling and back-translation without human evaluation. Finally, these preference pairs are used for preference optimization to enhance the model's S2ST capability further. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of our proposed PROST-LLM in improving the S2ST capability of LLMs.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-powered assistants have recently integrated memory mechanisms that record user preferences, leading to more personalized and user-aligned responses. However, irrelevant personalized memories are often introduced into the context, interfering with the LLM's intent understanding. To comprehensively investigate the dual effects of personalization, we develop RPEval, a benchmark comprising a personalized intent reasoning dataset and a multi-granularity evaluation protocol. RPEval reveals the widespread phenomenon of irrational personalization in existing LLMs and, through error pattern analysis, illustrates its negative impact on user experience. Finally, we introduce RP-Reasoner, which treats memory utilization as a pragmatic reasoning process, enabling the selective integration of personalized information. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms carefully designed baselines on RPEval, and resolves 80% of the bad cases observed in a large-scale commercial personalized assistant, highlighting the potential of pragmatic reasoning to mitigate irrational personalization. Our benchmark is publicly available at https://github.com/XueyangFeng/RPEval.

Conclusion: 多语言多脚本训练能增强模型泛化性，大语言模型在跨语言规范化任务中具有显著优势，未来需加强对方言变体和混合语料的建模能力。

Abstract: Social media data has been of interest to Natural Language Processing (NLP) practitioners for over a decade, because of its richness in information, but also challenges for automatic processing. Since language use is more informal, spontaneous, and adheres to many different sociolects, the performance of NLP models often deteriorates. One solution to this problem is to transform data to a standard variant before processing it, which is also called lexical normalization. There has been a wide variety of benchmarks and models proposed for this task. The MultiLexNorm benchmark proposed to unify these efforts, but it consists almost solely of languages from the Indo-European language family in the Latin script. Hence, we propose an extension to MultiLexNorm, which covers 5 Asian languages from different language families in 4 different scripts. We show that the previous state-of-the-art model performs worse on the new languages and propose a new architecture based on Large Language Models (LLMs), which shows more robust performance. Finally, we analyze remaining errors, revealing future directions for this task.

Motivation: 受线性表征假设启发，研究者希望定位模型中谄媚信号的线性可分位置，并探索其与事实准确性和质疑回应机制的关系。

Method: 在残差流、MLP层和注意力层训练线性探针，分析信号出现的位置；评估探针在FactQA基准的迁移能力，并通过注意力模式分析关键头的行为。

Result: 1) 中间层注意力头的探针操纵效果最佳；2) TruthfulQA探针可迁移至其他基准；3) 与已知“真实”方向重叠有限，且关键头关注用户的质疑表达。

Conclusion: 谄媚行为可通过解析注意力激活的几何结构并施加线性干预缓解，表明其与事实准确性存在关联但非同一机制。

Abstract: We find that correct-to-incorrect sycophancy signals are most linearly separable within multi-head attention activations. Motivated by the linear representation hypothesis, we train linear probes across the residual stream, multilayer perceptron (MLP), and attention layers to analyze where these signals emerge. Although separability appears in the residual stream and MLPs, steering using these probes is most effective in a sparse subset of middle-layer attention heads. Using TruthfulQA as the base dataset, we find that probes trained on it transfer effectively to other factual QA benchmarks. Furthermore, comparing our discovered direction to previously identified "truthful" directions reveals limited overlap, suggesting that factual accuracy, and deference resistance, arise from related but distinct mechanisms. Attention-pattern analysis further indicates that the influential heads attend disproportionately to expressions of user doubt, contributing to sycophantic shifts. Overall, these findings suggest that sycophancy can be mitigated through simple, targeted linear interventions that exploit the internal geometry of attention activations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 梯度方法在大模型实例解释中因参数维度爆炸而受限，现有降维方案缺乏系统评估，需探究架构导向的子集选择与全梯度投影两种降维策略的效能差异。

Method: 构建新基准测试框架，对比贪婪算法选择的组件子集与全梯度随机投影在检索任务中的表现，评估信息保留度和计算效率。

Result: 实验显示贪婪组件子集在信息捕捉有效性上超越全梯度和随机投影，且计算成本降低57%。

Conclusion: 模型架构导向的参数子集选择能最优平衡解释质量与计算开销，为大模型实例解释提供可扩展性更强的解决方案。

Abstract: Gradient-based methods for instance-based explanation for large language models (LLMs) are hindered by the immense dimensionality of model gradients. In practice, influence estimation is restricted to a subset of model parameters to make computation tractable, but this subset is often chosen ad hoc and rarely justified by systematic evaluation. This paper investigates if it is better to create low-dimensional representations by selecting a small, architecturally informed subset of model components or by projecting the full gradients into a lower-dimensional space. Using a novel benchmark, we show that a greedily selected subset of components captures the information about training data influence needed for a retrieval task more effectively than either the full gradient or random projection. We further find that this approach is more computationally efficient than random projection, demonstrating that targeted component selection is a practical strategy for making instance-based explanations of large models more computationally feasible.

TL;DR: 本文提出了PLawBench，一个基于真实法律实践场景的评估基准，用于测试大语言模型（LLMs）在处理复杂法律任务中的细粒度推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有法律基准依赖简化任务和单一维度指标，无法模拟真实法律工作的复杂性与多维推理需求，需建立更贴近实践的评估体系。

Method: 构建包含850个问题、13种法律场景的PLawBench基准，涵盖公众法律咨询、案例分析和文书生成三类任务，并开发基于LLM的自动评估系统，与人类专家评估结果对齐。

Result: 对10种先进LLMs的测试显示，所有模型均表现不佳，尤其在细粒度法律推理和复杂任务分解能力上存在显著缺陷。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在真实法律实践中的推理能力仍存在重大局限性，未来需针对性提升法律知识结构化建模与多步骤任务处理能力。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to legal domain-specific tasks, evaluating their ability to perform legal work in real-world settings has become essential. However, existing legal benchmarks rely on simplified and highly standardized tasks, failing to capture the ambiguity, complexity, and reasoning demands of real legal practice. Moreover, prior evaluations often adopt coarse, single-dimensional metrics and do not explicitly assess fine-grained legal reasoning. To address these limitations, we introduce PLawBench, a Practical Law Benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs in realistic legal practice scenarios. Grounded in real-world legal workflows, PLawBench models the core processes of legal practitioners through three task categories: public legal consultation, practical case analysis, and legal document generation. These tasks assess a model's ability to identify legal issues and key facts, perform structured legal reasoning, and generate legally coherent documents. PLawBench comprises 850 questions across 13 practical legal scenarios, with each question accompanied by expert-designed evaluation rubrics, resulting in approximately 12,500 rubric items for fine-grained assessment. Using an LLM-based evaluator aligned with human expert judgments, we evaluate 10 state-of-the-art LLMs. Experimental results show that none achieves strong performance on PLawBench, revealing substantial limitations in the fine-grained legal reasoning capabilities of current LLMs and highlighting important directions for future evaluation and development of legal LLMs. Data is available at: https://github.com/skylenage/PLawbench.

Abstract: Generalization to unseen concepts is a central challenge due to the scarcity of human annotations in Mention-agnostic Biomedical Concept Recognition (MA-BCR). This work makes two key contributions to systematically address this issue. First, we propose an evaluation framework built on hierarchical concept indices and novel metrics to measure generalization. Second, we explore LLM-based Auto-Labeled Data (ALD) as a scalable resource, creating a task-specific pipeline for its generation. Our research unequivocally shows that while LLM-generated ALD cannot fully substitute for manual annotations, it is a valuable resource for improving generalization, successfully providing models with the broader coverage and structural knowledge needed to approach recognizing unseen concepts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于Transformer的AES系统因过度关注二语表层特征产生偏见，需探究其评分机制并解决对ESL高分写作群体的不公正性。

Method: 基于DeBERTa-v3模型进行偏差分析，构建包含17,161对匹配作文的数据集，采用三元组对比学习与Triplet Margin Loss优化潜在表征对齐。

Result: 高分ESL作文评分差距从10.3%降至6.2%（消减39.9%），QWK维持0.76，语言分析显示模型成功分离句法复杂性与语法错误。

Conclusion: 对比学习策略可有效缓解AES系统对二语写作者的偏见，在保证评分一致性的同时实现更公平的评估。

Abstract: As Automated Essay Scoring (AES) systems are increasingly used in high-stakes educational settings, concerns regarding algorithmic bias against English as a Second Language (ESL) learners have increased. Current Transformer-based regression models trained primarily on native-speaker corpora often learn spurious correlations between surface-level L2 linguistic features and essay quality. In this study, we conduct a bias study of a fine-tuned DeBERTa-v3 model using the ASAP 2.0 and ELLIPSE datasets, revealing a constrained score scaling for high-proficiency ESL writing where high-proficiency ESL essays receive scores 10.3% lower than Native speaker essays of identical human-rated quality. To mitigate this, we propose applying contrastive learning with a triplet construction strategy: Contrastive Learning with Matched Essay Pairs. We constructed a dataset of 17,161 matched essay pairs and fine-tuned the model using Triplet Margin Loss to align the latent representations of ESL and Native writing. Our approach reduced the high-proficiency scoring disparity by 39.9% (to a 6.2% gap) while maintaining a Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) of 0.76. Post-hoc linguistic analysis suggests the model successfully disentangled sentence complexity from grammatical error, preventing the penalization of valid L2 syntactic structures.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）的自动化管道，用于标注放射学报告中的纵向信息（如疾病进展），解决了现有方法依赖手工规则、效率低且准确性不足的问题。实验表明，所选模型Qwen2.5-32B在标注效果上优于传统方法，并构建了新的标准化基准数据集，用于评估报告生成模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有放射学报告纵向信息标注方法（如手动规则和简单自动化工具）存在效率低、适应性差、遗漏关键信息等问题，缺乏可靠的自动化工具进行疾病进展趋势的对比分析。LLM具备捕捉语言模式和语义变化的能力，可提供更灵活高效的替代方案。

Result: Qwen2.5-32B在纵向信息检测和疾病跟踪任务中F1分数分别比现有方法高11.3%和5.3%；成功生成覆盖95,169份报告的标注数据集，成为评估放射报告生成模型的统一基准。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的标注方法在准确性与效率上超越传统方案，并提供了公开可用的标准化数据集，显著提升了放射学报告生成模型的评估能力。

Abstract: Longitudinal information in radiology reports refers to the sequential tracking of findings across multiple examinations over time, which is crucial for monitoring disease progression and guiding clinical decisions. Many recent automated radiology report generation methods are designed to capture longitudinal information; however, validating their performance is challenging. There is no proper tool to consistently label temporal changes in both ground-truth and model-generated texts for meaningful comparisons. Existing annotation methods are typically labor-intensive, relying on the use of manual lexicons and rules. Complex rules are closed-source, domain specific and hard to adapt, whereas overly simple ones tend to miss essential specialised information. Large language models (LLMs) offer a promising annotation alternative, as they are capable of capturing nuanced linguistic patterns and semantic similarities without extensive manual intervention. They also adapt well to new contexts. In this study, we therefore propose an LLM-based pipeline to automatically annotate longitudinal information in radiology reports. The pipeline first identifies sentences containing relevant information and then extracts the progression of diseases. We evaluate and compare five mainstream LLMs on these two tasks using 500 manually annotated reports. Considering both efficiency and performance, Qwen2.5-32B was subsequently selected and used to annotate another 95,169 reports from the public MIMIC-CXR dataset. Our Qwen2.5-32B-annotated dataset provided us with a standardized benchmark for evaluating report generation models. Using this new benchmark, we assessed seven state-of-the-art report generation models. Our LLM-based annotation method outperforms existing annotation solutions, achieving 11.3\% and 5.3\% higher F1-scores for longitudinal information detection and disease tracking, respectively.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现LLMs在低资源语言中的幻觉检测准确率下降远小于任务准确性下降幅度，表明模型内部存在不确定性信号，且检测器在同语言和多语言场景下有效但跨语言检测需语言内监督。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在高资源语言（如英语）表现优异，但在低资源语言（如孟加拉语）中存在准确率骤降（低资源效应），且会生成错误信息（幻觉）。本文旨在探索现有幻觉检测机制在低资源语言场景下的有效性及鲁棒性。

Method: 在3大领域（事实记忆、STEM、人文）的5项任务中，使用4类LLM和3种幻觉检测器进行实验，评估任务准确性与幻觉检测准确性在英语、低资源语言和多语言设置下的表现差异。

Result: 低资源语言任务准确性平均下降显著，但幻觉检测准确率仅小幅下滑（降幅为任务准确率的数倍之一）。检测器在同语言和多语言场景下保持鲁棒性，但跨语言检测（如英语训练模型直接检测中文）效果明显下降。

Conclusion: LLMs在低资源语言中仍保留内部不确定性信号，现有幻觉检测器具有语言通用性，但跨语言部署需目标语言的监督训练，建议未来研究应重点关注跨语言检测机制的优化。

Abstract: LLMs, while outperforming humans in a wide range of tasks, can still fail in unanticipated ways. We focus on two pervasive failure modes: (i) hallucinations, where models produce incorrect information about the world, and (ii) the low-resource effect, where the models show impressive performance in high-resource languages like English but the performance degrades significantly in low-resource languages like Bengali. We study the intersection of these issues and ask: do hallucination detectors suffer from the low-resource effect? We conduct experiments on five tasks across three domains (factual recall, STEM, and Humanities). Experiments with four LLMs and three hallucination detectors reveal a curious finding: As expected, the task accuracies in low-resource languages experience large drops (compared to English). However, the drop in detectors' accuracy is often several times smaller than the drop in task accuracy. Our findings suggest that even in low-resource languages, the internal mechanisms of LLMs might encode signals about their uncertainty. Further, the detectors are robust within language (even for non-English) and in multilingual setups, but not in cross-lingual settings without in-language supervision.

TL;DR: 本论文提出P-Tokens方法，在不依赖事实特定示例的情况下实现对大语言模型的知识编辑，性能优于现有In-context Editing（IKE）技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统知识编辑方法（IKE）需要人工标注长文本示例，导致上下文占用高与标注成本过高等问题，阻碍了知识编辑的实用性。

Method: 提出通过可学习的特殊标记（P-Tokens）模拟IKE示例效果的方法，将知识编辑转化为P-Tokens引导的参数优化问题，消除了对事实特定示例的依赖。

Result: 在两个数据集和三种LLM上的实验表明，P-Tokens在编辑准确性上超越/匹敌IKE，且具有对抗干扰的鲁棒性；研究还发现增加P-Tokens数量可提升性能，且对临近知识干扰较小。

Conclusion: 通过量化评估与对比实验证明，P-Tokens提供了一个更轻量级、可扩展性强的知识编辑框架，解决了现有技术的上下文效率瓶颈和实用化限制。

Abstract: In-context knowledge editing (IKE) is a promising technique for updating Large Language Models (LLMs) with new information. However, IKE relies on lengthy, fact-specific demonstrations which are costly to create and consume significant context window space. In this paper, we introduce persuasion tokens (P-Tokens) -- special tokens trained to replicate the effect of IKE demonstrations, enabling efficient knowledge editing without requiring fact-specific demonstrations. We evaluate P-Tokens across two editing datasets and three LLMs, demonstrating performance comparable to, and often exceeding, IKE. We further find that editing performance is robust to distractors with small negative effects to neighboring facts, and that increasing the number of P-Tokens improves performance. Our work addresses key limitations of IKE and provides a more practical and scalable alternative for editing LLMs.

Conclusion: LLMs能有效承担自动标注者与裁决者的角色，为细粒度情感分析提供经济且可扩展的标注解决方案。

Abstract: Fine-grained opinion analysis of text provides a detailed understanding of expressed sentiments, including the addressed entity. Although this level of detail is sound, it requires considerable human effort and substantial cost to annotate opinions in datasets for training models, especially across diverse domains and real-world applications. We explore the feasibility of LLMs as automatic annotators for fine-grained opinion analysis, addressing the shortage of domain-specific labelled datasets. In this work, we use a declarative annotation pipeline. This approach reduces the variability of manual prompt engineering when using LLMs to identify fine-grained opinion spans in text. We also present a novel methodology for an LLM to adjudicate multiple labels and produce final annotations. After trialling the pipeline with models of different sizes for the Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction (ASTE) and Aspect-Category-Opinion-Sentiment (ACOS) analysis tasks, we show that LLMs can serve as automatic annotators and adjudicators, achieving high Inter-Annotator Agreement across individual LLM-based annotators. This reduces the cost and human effort needed to create these fine-grained opinion-annotated datasets.

Motivation: 填补对T2I模型SoS行为的全面分析缺失，揭示语言敏感性导致文化偏见的机制

Method: 构建包含171种文化身份、14种语言的提示集，测试7个T2I模型，引入新度量指标分析其SoS倾向

Result: 除一个模型外，其余在至少两种语言中显示强表面倾向，效应随文本编码器层级增强，表面倾向与刻板视觉输出正相关

Conclusion: T2I模型普遍存在Surface-over-Semantics问题，语言表面形式显著影响生成结果并强化文化刻板印象，需警惕多语言应用中的偏见风险

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models are increasingly employed by users worldwide. However, prior research has pointed to the high sensitivity of T2I towards particular input languages - when faced with languages other than English (i.e., different surface forms of the same prompt), T2I models often produce culturally stereotypical depictions, prioritizing the surface over the prompt's semantics. Yet a comprehensive analysis of this behavior, which we dub Surface-over-Semantics (SoS), is missing. We present the first analysis of T2I models' SoS tendencies. To this end, we create a set of prompts covering 171 cultural identities, translated into 14 languages, and use it to prompt seven T2I models. To quantify SoS tendencies across models, languages, and cultures, we introduce a novel measure and analyze how the tendencies we identify manifest visually. We show that all but one model exhibit strong surface-level tendency in at least two languages, with this effect intensifying across the layers of T2I text encoders. Moreover, these surface tendencies frequently correlate with stereotypical visual depictions.

Motivation: 为明确LLMs的能力源于记忆还是推理，需一个可控环境分离这两种认知能力。国际象棋因其明确的规则和可扩展的评估体系，成为理想测试平台。

Method: 构建基于训练数据接近程度的国际象棋局面分类体系（从常规到需第一性原理解答的新颖局面），对多代GPT模型在不同推理强度下的表现进行系统性测试，并利用引擎评估量化性能。

Result: 模型性能随流体智力需求增加显著下降，分布外任务表现接近随机水平；推理增强技术（如思维链）的效果随数据分布接近性提升而边际递减。

Conclusion: 现有LLM在系统性泛化上存在瓶颈，仅依赖数据与模型扩展无法解决流体智力问题，需开发超越当前架构的新机制。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities, yet it remains unclear to what extent these reflect sophisticated recall (crystallized intelligence) or reasoning ability (fluid intelligence). We introduce chess as a controlled testbed for disentangling these faculties. Leveraging the game's structure and scalable engine evaluations, we construct a taxonomy of positions varying in training corpus proximity--ranging from common states solvable by memorization to novel ones requiring first-principles reasoning. We systematically evaluate multiple GPT generations under varying reasoning intensities. Our analysis reveals a clear gradient: performance consistently degrades as fluid intelligence demands increase. Notably, in out-of-distribution tasks, performance collapses to random levels. While newer models improve, progress slows significantly for tasks outside the training distribution. Furthermore, while reasoning-augmented inference improves performance, its marginal benefit per token decreases with distributional proximity. These results suggest current architectures remain limited in systematic generalization, highlighting the need for mechanisms beyond scale to achieve robust fluid intelligence.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于说服技术的新型对抗攻击方法，通过生成式大语言模型（LLM）改写声明，利用15种说服技巧对自动化事实核查系统（AFC）发起攻击，实验表明该方法能显著降低验证和证据检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AFC系统的对抗攻击多依赖噪声注入或语义修改，但现实虚假信息传播中广泛应用的说服技术尚未被充分研究。这些技术通过心理操纵影响受众认知，可能使虚假声明更易绕过检测。

Method: 构建包含15种说服技巧（分6类）的攻击框架，使用生成式LLM对FEVER和FEVEROUS基准数据集中的声明进行改写。采用解耦评估策略，分别测试说服攻击对声明验证和证据检索的影响。

Result: 实验显示说服攻击导致验证准确率显著下降（FEVER: 18.6%, FEVEROUS: 22.3%），证据检索的召回率降低15.4%-30.7%。其中诉诸权威、情感共鸣和模因强化等技巧攻击效果最强。

Conclusion: 说服技术作为现实虚假信息的核心传播手段，被证实是极具威胁的对抗攻击武器。研究提示现有AFC系统在认知操纵层面存在严重安全漏洞，需开发针对心理说服机制的防御策略。

Abstract: Automated fact-checking (AFC) systems are susceptible to adversarial attacks, enabling false claims to evade detection. Existing adversarial frameworks typically rely on injecting noise or altering semantics, yet no existing framework exploits the adversarial potential of persuasion techniques, which are widely used in disinformation campaigns to manipulate audiences. In this paper, we introduce a novel class of persuasive adversarial attacks on AFCs by employing a generative LLM to rephrase claims using persuasion techniques. Considering 15 techniques grouped into 6 categories, we study the effects of persuasion on both claim verification and evidence retrieval using a decoupled evaluation strategy. Experiments on the FEVER and FEVEROUS benchmarks show that persuasion attacks can substantially degrade both verification performance and evidence retrieval. Our analysis identifies persuasion techniques as a potent class of adversarial attacks, highlighting the need for more robust AFC systems.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a permutation-based framework to detect reflection biases in document embeddings, revealing positional and linguistic biases in existing models, and proposes an attention calibration method to improve representation fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Document embeddings should equally represent all parts for search discoverability. However, potential reflection biases may cause under-representation of certain document segments, requiring systematic evaluation and mitigation.

Method: Proposed a permutation-based evaluation framework to quantify reflection biases. Analyzed attention distributions in pooling-token embeddings to identify positional bias sources. Devised an inference-time attention calibration method to redistribute attention across document positions.

Result: Discovered systematic positional biases (early segments over-represented) and linguistic resource biases (English segments privileged over lower-resource languages). Found front-loaded attention distributions caused positional bias. Attention calibration improved discoverability of marginalized segments.

Conclusion: Embedding models systematically bias towards early/English segments in long multilingual documents. Attention calibration during inference effectively mitigates positional bias, enabling fairer document retrieval while maintaining overall search effectiveness.

Abstract: To be discoverable in an embedding-based search process, each part of a document should be reflected in its embedding representation. To quantify any potential reflection biases, we introduce a permutation-based evaluation framework. With this, we observe that state-of-the-art embedding models exhibit systematic positional and language biases when documents are longer and consist of multiple segments. Specifically, early segments and segments in higher-resource languages like English are over-represented, while later segments and segments in lower-resource languages are marginalized. In our further analysis, we find that the positional bias stems from front-loaded attention distributions in pooling-token embeddings, where early tokens receive more attention. To mitigate this issue, we introduce an inference-time attention calibration method that redistributes attention more evenly across document positions, increasing discoverabiltiy of later segments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式LLMs缺乏直接引用输入特定部分的机制，导致序列标注任务中出现不一致的提示策略，论文旨在系统分类现有方法并提出改进方案。

Method: 将现有策略分为标签标注、位置索引和内容匹配三类，提出LogitMatch约束解码方法，强制输出与有效输入片段对齐以解决内容匹配缺陷。

Result: 在四类任务评估中，标签标注仍是稳健基线，但LogitMatch在消除片段匹配问题后，显著优于内容匹配方法并在部分场景超越其他策略。

Conclusion: 生成式模型需针对性设计约束机制，LogitMatch有效解决内容匹配局限，但在复杂任务中标签标注仍具优势。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for text analysis tasks, such as named entity recognition or error detection. Unlike encoder-based models, however, generative architectures lack an explicit mechanism to refer to specific parts of their input. This leads to a variety of ad-hoc prompting strategies for span labeling, often with inconsistent results. In this paper, we categorize these strategies into three families: tagging the input text, indexing numerical positions of spans, and matching span content. To address the limitations of content matching, we introduce LogitMatch, a new constrained decoding method that forces the model's output to align with valid input spans. We evaluate all methods across four diverse tasks. We find that while tagging remains a robust baseline, LogitMatch improves upon competitive matching-based methods by eliminating span matching issues and outperforms other strategies in some setups.
