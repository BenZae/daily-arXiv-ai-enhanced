Format Decoupled Reinforcement Learning for Document OCR", "comment": "technical report", "summary": "Reading text from images or scanned documents via OCR models has been a longstanding focus of researchers. Intuitively, text reading is perceived as a straightforward perceptual task, and existing work primarily focuses on constructing enriched data engineering to enhance SFT capabilities. In this work, we observe that even advanced OCR models exhibit significantly higher entropy in formatted text (\\emph{e.g.}, formula, table, etc.) compared to plain text, often by an order of magnitude. These statistical patterns reveal that advanced OCR models struggle with high output uncertainty when dealing with format sensitive document, suggesting that reasoning over diverse reading pathways may improve OCR performance. To address this, we propose format decoupled reinforcement learning (FD-RL), which leverages high-entropy patterns for targeted optimization. Our approach employs entropy-based data filtration strategy to identify format-intensive instances, and adopt format decoupled rewards tailored to different format types, enabling format-level validation rather than token-level memorization. FD-RL achieves an average score of 90.41 on OmniDocBench, setting a new record for end-to-end models on this highly popular benchmark. More importantly, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies over data, training, filtering, and rewarding strategies, thoroughly validating their effectiveness.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper proposes FD-RL, a reinforcement learning method targeting OCR challenges in formatted documents by leveraging entropy patterns for optimization.", "motivation": "Advanced OCR models struggle with high output uncertainty (entropy) in structured text (e.g., tables, formulas), indicating a need for reasoning over diverse reading pathways for improved performance.", "method": "FD-RL uses entropy-based data filtration to identify complex instances and applies format-specific rewards to decouple learning across different document structures, enabling format-level validation instead of token-level memorization.", "result": "FD-RL achieved a record 90.41 score on OmniDocBench, outperforming end-to-end models, with ablation studies confirming the effectiveness of data filtering, training strategies, and reward design.", "conclusion": "The work demonstrates that addressing high-uncertainty patterns through format-aware reinforcement learning significantly enhances OCR accuracy in structured documents while providing validated insights into training methodologies."}}

These methods leverage pre-trained diffusion models to reconstruct inputs and measure residuals for distinguishing real from fake images. Their key advantage lies in reducing reliance on dataset-specific artifacts and improving generalization under distribution shifts. However, they are limited by significant inefficiency due to multi-step inversion and reconstruction, and their reliance on diffusion backbones further limits generalization to other generative paradigms such as GANs.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel fake image detection framework, called R$^2$BD, built upon two key designs: (1) G-LDM, a unified reconstruction model that simulates the generation behaviors of VAEs, GANs, and diffusion models, thereby broadening the detection scope beyond prior diffusion-only approaches; and (2) a residual bias calculation module that distinguishes real and fake images in a single inference step, which is a significant efficiency improvement over existing methods that typically require 20$+$ steps.\n  Extensive experiments on the benchmark from 10 public datasets demonstrate that R$^2$BD is over 22$\\times$ faster than existing reconstruction-based methods while achieving superior detection accuracy. In cross-dataset evaluations, it outperforms state-of-the-art methods by an average of 13.87\\%, showing strong efficiency and generalization across diverse generative methods.

The key challenge of this task lies in effectively modeling the interaction between heterogeneous features during multimodal fusion, so as to avoid single-modality dominance or information degradation, particularly in cross-domain scenarios. To address this, we propose a Cross-Modal Residual Fusion Network, which introduces bidirectional residual interactions between audio and visual streams to achieve complementary modeling and fine-grained alignment, while maintaining the independence of their representations. Unlike conventional methods that rely on simple concatenation or attention gating, CRFN explicitly models cross-modal interactions via residual connections and incorporates stabilization techniques to improve convergence and robustness. Experiments on the Replica and Matterport3D datasets demonstrate that CRFN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art fusion baselines and achieves stronger cross-domain generalization.

This review critically examines the intersection of PTSD and chronic illnesses as expressed on social media platforms. By systematically analyzing literature from 2008 to 2024, the study explores how PTSD manifests and is managed in individuals with chronic conditions such as cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune disorders, with a focus on online expressions on platforms like X (formally known as Twitter) and Facebook. Findings demonstrate that social media data offers valuable insights into the unique challenges faced by individuals with both PTSD and chronic illnesses. Specifically, natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) techniques can identify potential PTSD cases among these populations, achieving accuracy rates between 74% and 90%. Furthermore, the role of online support communities in shaping coping strategies and facilitating early interventions is highlighted. This review underscores the necessity of incorporating considerations of pre-existing medical conditions in PTSD research and treatment, emphasizing social media's potential as a monitoring and support tool for vulnerable groups.

We propose SAR-Net, a unified framework that addresses this challenge through principled scene-appearance disentanglement. Our key insight is that observed images can be decomposed into domain-invariant scene representations and domain-specific appearance codes, enabling registration via re-rendering rather than direct intensity matching. We establish theoretical conditions under which this decomposition enables consistent cross-domain alignment (Proposition 1) and prove that our scene consistency loss provides a sufficient condition for geometric correspondence in the shared latent space (Proposition 2). Empirically, we validate SAR-Net on bidirectional scanning microscopy, where coupled domain shift and geometric distortion create a challenging real-world testbed. Our method achieves 0.885 SSIM and 0.979 NCC, representing 3.1x improvement over the strongest baseline, while maintaining real-time performance (77 fps). Ablation studies confirm that both scene consistency and domain alignment losses are necessary: removing either degrades performance by 90% SSIM or causes 223x increase in latent alignment error, respectively.

Across 26 frontier models from nine providers, we observe an average attack success rate of 71.3%, with no model family proving reliably robust. Together with our prior work on Adversarial Poetry, these findings suggest that structurally-grounded jailbreaks constitute a broad vulnerability class rather than isolated techniques. The space of culturally coded frames that can mediate harmful intent is vast, likely inexhaustible by pattern-matching defenses alone.

Early studies have combined manual engineering with deep neural networks, achieving notable progress in specific semantic-related embodied tasks. However, as embodied agents encounter increasingly complex environments and open-ended tasks, the demand for more generalizable and robust semantic processing capabilities has become imperative. Recent advances in foundation models (FMs) address this challenge through their cross-domain generalization abilities and rich semantic priors, reshaping the landscape of embodied AI research. In this survey, we propose the Semantic Lifecycle as a unified framework to characterize the evolution of semantic knowledge within embodied AI driven by foundation models. Departing from traditional paradigms that treat semantic processing as isolated modules or disjoint tasks, our framework offers a holistic perspective that captures the continuous flow and maintenance of semantic knowledge. Guided by this embodied semantic lifecycle, we further analyze and compare recent advances across three key stages: acquisition, representation, and storage.

Entity-level unlearning addresses this issue by removing all knowledge of a specific entity while preserving the model's overall capabilities. Existing approaches typically rely on full-model fine-tuning or prompt-based interventions, which can be computationally expensive or brittle when handling paraphrased queries. Recently, model editing has emerged as an efficient alternative for updating knowledge in LLMs, offering a promising direction for unlearning. However, existing editing techniques are typically designed for instance-level updates, modifying responses to specific attributes of an entity rather than eliminating all knowledge associated with the entity. In this paper, we investigate how editing techniques can be adapted for effective and efficient entity-level unlearning. To this end, we introduce a novel consistency-aware editing (CAE) framework. CAE aggregates a diverse set of prompts related to a target entity, including its attributes, relations, and adversarial paraphrases. It then jointly learns a low-rank update guided by a consistency regularizer that aligns the editing directions across prompts. This promotes robust and comprehensive forgetting while minimizing interference with unrelated knowledge. We further examine where different entities are stored within the model and how many diverse prompts are needed for successful unlearning. We evaluate CAE on two challenging benchmarks, RWKU and ToFU, and demonstrate that it (i) provides insights into how entity-level knowledge is internally represented and deleted in LLMs, (ii) significantly improves forgetting accuracy and robustness over traditional unlearning and editing baselines, and (iii) enables scalable entity removal using only tens of carefully selected prompts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7f16\u8f91\uff08CAE\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u7684\u5b9e\u4f53\u7ea7\u9057\u5fd8\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u79e9\u66f4\u65b0\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u8054\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u5b9e\u4f53\u5220\u9664\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLMs\u9057\u5fd8\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5168\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u6216\u63d0\u793a\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6216\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u6539\u5199\u67e5\u8be2\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u8f91\u6280\u672f\u867d\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u66f4\u65b0\u800c\u975e\u5b9e\u4f53\u7ea7\u5f7b\u5e95\u5220\u9664\u3002", "method": "CAE\u6846\u67b6\u6574\u5408\u76ee\u6807\u5b9e\u4f53\u7684\u591a\u6837\u63d0\u793a\uff08\u542b\u5c5e\u6027\u3001\u5173\u7cfb\u53ca\u5bf9\u6297\u6539\u5199\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u9879\u7684\u4f4e\u79e9\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u5411\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u5e72\u6270\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u9762\u9057\u5fd8\u3002", "result": "\u5728RWKU\u548cToFU\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cCAE\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u9057\u5fd8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u4ec5\u9700\u6570\u5341\u4e2a\u7cbe\u9009\u63d0\u793a\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5b9e\u4f53\u5220\u9664\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86LLMs\u5185\u90e8\u5b9e\u4f53\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u5b58\u50a8\u4e0e\u5220\u9664\u673a\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "CAE\u4e3aLLMs\u5b9e\u4f53\u7ea7\u9057\u5fd8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6548\u7387\u3001\u5168\u9762\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002"}}

In this study, we explore how structured knowledge, specifically, subject-predicate-object triples, can enhance the clustering and classification of scientific papers. We propose a modular pipeline that combines unsupervised clustering and supervised classification over multiple document representations: raw abstracts, extracted triples, and hybrid formats that integrate both. Using a filtered arXiv corpus, we extract relational triples from abstracts and construct four text representations, which we embed using four state-of-the-art transformer models: MiniLM, MPNet, SciBERT, and SPECTER. We evaluate the resulting embeddings with KMeans, GMM, and HDBSCAN for unsupervised clustering, and fine-tune classification models for arXiv subject prediction. Our results show that full abstract text yields the most coherent clusters, but that hybrid representations incorporating triples consistently improve classification performance, reaching up to 92.6% accuracy and 0.925 macro-F1. We also find that lightweight sentence encoders (MiniLM, MPNet) outperform domain-specific models (SciBERT, SPECTER) in clustering, while SciBERT excels in structured-input classification. These findings highlight the complementary benefits of combining unstructured text with structured knowledge, offering new insights into knowledge-infused representations for semantic organization of scientific documents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\uff08\u4e3b-\u8c13-\u5bbe\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\uff09\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u6d41\u7a0b\u6539\u5584\u79d1\u5b66\u8bba\u6587\u805a\u7c7b\u4e0e\u5206\u7c7b\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u5d4c\u5165\uff08MiniLM/MPNet/SciBERT/SPECTER\uff09\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728arXiv\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523092.6%\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9\u79d1\u5b66\u6587\u732e\u89c4\u6a21\u6fc0\u589e\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4e0e\u7406\u89e3\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u5982\u4f55\u589e\u5f3a\u6587\u732e\u805a\u7c7b\u4e0e\u5206\u7c7b\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u878d\u5408\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1a1.\u4ece\u6458\u8981\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u56db\u79cd\u6587\u672c\u8868\u793a 2.\u4f7f\u7528\u56db\u79cdTransformer\u6a21\u578b\u5d4c\u5165\u6587\u672c 3.\u91c7\u7528KMeans/GMM/HDBSCAN\u805a\u7c7b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8868\u793a\u6548\u679c 4.\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4barXiv\u4e3b\u9898", "result": "\u5168\u6458\u8981\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u6700\u8fde\u8d2f\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u4f46\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u6df7\u5408\u8868\u793a\u4f7f\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe92.6%\uff08\u5b8fF1 0.925\uff09\u3002\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\uff08MiniLM/MPNet\uff09\u805a\u7c7b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u9886\u57df\u6a21\u578b\uff08SciBERT/SPECTER\uff09\uff0c\u800cSciBERT\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8f93\u5165\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u5360\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6587\u672c\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u878d\u5408\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u79d1\u5b66\u6587\u732e\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u77e5\u8bc6\u6ce8\u5165\u8868\u793a\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u793a\u9886\u57df\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u805a\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f73\uff0c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u4e3b\u8981\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

We introduce UAMSA-UNet, an Uncertainty-Aware Multi-Scale Attention-based Bayesian U-Net that in- stead leverages Monte Carlo Dropout to learn a data-driven smoothing prior over its predictions, while fusing multi-scale features and attention maps to capture both fine details and global context. Our smoothing-regularized loss augments binary cross-entropy with a variance penalty across stochas- tic forward passes, discouraging spurious fluctuations and yielding spatially coherent masks. On BraTS2023, UAMSA- UNet improves Dice Similarity Coefficient by up to 3.3% and mean IoU by up to 2.7% over U-Net; on BraTS2024, it delivers up to 4.5% Dice and 4.0% IoU gains over the best baseline. Remarkably, it also reduces FLOPs by 42.5% rel- ative to U-Net++ while maintaining higher accuracy.

To achieve this, the study first develops a multimodal fusion method combining thermal imaging and LiDAR, enabling precise calibration and synchronization of multimodal data streams to create accurate representations of temperature distributions in buildings. Second, it integrates this fusion approach with LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO), enabling full coverage of large-scale structures and allowing for detailed monitoring of temperature variations and defect detection across inspection cycles. Experimental validations, including case studies on a bridge and a hall building, demonstrate that Thermo-LIO can detect detailed thermal anomalies and structural defects more accurately than traditional methods.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising solution, their reliability as automated judges in rubric-based settings requires rigorous assessment. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the performance of LLM-judges for rubric-based short-answer grading. We investigate three key aspects: the alignment of LLM grading with expert judgment across varying rubric complexities, the trade-off between uncertainty and accuracy facilitated by a consensus-based deferral mechanism, and the model's robustness under random input perturbations and adversarial attacks. Using the SciEntsBank benchmark and Qwen 2.5-72B, we find that alignment is strong for binary tasks but degrades with increased rubric granularity.

We adapt SAM 2.1 for pose-guided segmentation with minimal encoder modifications, retaining its strong generalization. Using a fine-tuning strategy called PoseMaskRefine, we incorporate pose keypoints with high visibility into the iterative correction process originally employed by SAM, yielding improved robustness and accuracy across multiple datasets. During inference, we simplify prompting by selecting only the three keypoints with the highest visibility. This strategy reduces sensitivity to common errors, such as missing body parts or misclassified clothing, and allows accurate mask prediction from as few as a single keypoint.

Code available at: github.com/cagopat/InftyThink-with-Cross-Chain-Memory", "summary": "Iterative summarization based reasoning frameworks such as InftyThink enable long-horizon reasoning in large language models (LLMs) by controlling context growth, but they repeatedly regenerate similar reasoning strategies across tasks. We introduce InftyThink with Cross-Chain Memory, an extension that augments iterative reasoning with an embedding-based semantic cache of previously successful reasoning patterns. At each reasoning step, the model retrieves and conditions on the most semantically similar stored lemmas, guiding inference without expanding the context window indiscriminately. Experiments on MATH500, AIME2024, and GPQA-Diamond demonstrate that semantic lemma retrieval improves accuracy in structured domains while exposing failure modes in tests that include heterogeneous domains. Geometric analyses of reasoning trajectories reveal that cache retrieval induces directional biases in embedding space, leading to consistent fix (improve baseline accuracy) and break (degradation in baseline accuracy) attractors.

Motivated by recent progress in blockwise self-supervised learning (BWSSL), we ask whether masked video transformers can be trained without end-to-end backpropagation. Applying BWSSL to masked video modeling remains relatively underexplored and must handle spatiotemporal context and long-range temporal structure. More broadly, analyses that compare BWSSL and end-to-end training in terms of learning dynamics and depth-wise representation development remain sparse. We apply blockwise learning to a masked autoencoding video vision transformer by partitioning the encoder into blocks, each of which is optimized with a local masked reconstruction loss. Across model sizes and partition granularities, training converges and yields representations close to matched end-to-end baselines under linear-probe and retrieval proxies. In order to compare intermediate representations, we analyze depth-wise decodability, inter-block similarity, and patch-level diagnostics. Blockwise training exposes higher-level structure earlier, while later blocks saturate and operate in a more geometry-preserving regime. It can also induce token-level shifts consistent with stronger early mixing that pooled metrics can miss. These findings point to late-block saturation and interface formation as contributors to the remaining gap.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5757\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\uff08BWSSL\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e26\u63a9\u7801\u7684\u89c6\u9891Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5176\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "motivation": "\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u4f9d\u8d56\u5168\u5c40\u8bef\u5dee\u4fe1\u53f7\u8fdb\u884c\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u800c\u8fd1\u671f\u5206\u5757\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\uff08BWSSL\uff09\u7684\u8fdb\u5c55\u4fc3\u4f7f\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u63a2\u7d22\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u4f18\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u5c42\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u957f\u65f6\u5e8f\u7ed3\u6784\u4e3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5212\u5206\u4e3a\u591a\u4e2a\u5206\u5757\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5206\u5757\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u63a9\u7801\u91cd\u5efa\u635f\u5931\u8fdb\u884c\u72ec\u7acb\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u63a9\u7801\u89c6\u9891\u81ea\u7f16\u7801Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u5206\u5757\u7c92\u5ea6\u4e0b\u8bad\u7ec3\u5747\u80fd\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u5176\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\u901a\u8fc7\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u9488\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u8bc4\u4f30\u63a5\u8fd1\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b0\u5206\u5757\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ef\u66f4\u65e9\u66b4\u9732\u9ad8\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u540e\u5c42\u5206\u5757\u8d8b\u4e8e\u51e0\u4f55\u4fdd\u6301\u72b6\u6001\u5e76\u51fa\u73b0\u9971\u548c\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5206\u5757\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ef\u8bf1\u5bfctoken\u7ea7\u7279\u5f81\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u665a\u671f\u5206\u5757\u9971\u548c\u4e0e\u63a5\u53e3\u5f62\u6210\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u5f53\u524d\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u56e0\u7d20\u3002"}}

Our two-stage training pipeline first uses supervised fine-tuning to teach structured chain-of-thought reasoning, and then applies a GRPO-based alignment stage to reinforce logical consistency, domain expertise, and empathetic caregiving strategies. We further design an evaluation framework comprising temperament-sensitive multiple-choice tests and human assessments. The results demonstrate that PediaMind-R1 can accurately interpret early childhood temperament profiles and proactively engage in individualized reasoning.

Despite these achievements, existing methods universally employ sparse sampling during training--utilizing only one template and one search image per sequence--which fails to comprehensively explore spatiotemporal information in videos. This limitation constrains performance and cause the gap between lightweight and high-performance trackers. To bridge this divide while maintaining real-time efficiency, we propose STDTrack, a framework that pioneers the integration of reliable spatiotemporal dependencies into lightweight trackers. Our approach implements dense video sampling to maximize spatiotemporal information utilization. We introduce a temporally propagating spatiotemporal token to guide per-frame feature extraction. To ensure comprehensive target state representation, we disign the Multi-frame Information Fusion Module (MFIFM), which augments current dependencies using historical context. The MFIFM operates on features stored in our constructed Spatiotemporal Token Maintainer (STM), where a quality-based update mechanism ensures information reliability.

However, its reliability requires robustness against strategic attacks such as guesswork or verbosity that may artificially inflate scores without improving actual correctness. In this work, we systematically investigate whether such tactics deceive answer matching models by prompting examinee models to: (1) generate verbose responses, (2) provide multiple answers when unconfident, and (3) embed conflicting answers with the correct answer near the start of their response. Our results show that these manipulations do not increase scores and often reduce them. Additionally, binary scoring (which requires a matcher to answer with a definitive \"correct\" or \"incorrect\") is more robust to attacks than continuous scoring (which requires a matcher to determine partial correctness). These findings show that answer matching is generally robust to inexpensive text manipulation and is a viable alternative to traditional LLM-as-a-judge or human evaluation when reference answers are available.", "AI": {"tldr": "Automated answer matching using LLMs effectively resists strategic text manipulations like verbosity and conflicting answers, with binary scoring proving more robust than continuous scoring.", "motivation": "To validate the reliability of automated answer matching systems against strategic attacks that could exploit human-like evaluation flaws, ensuring scalability for educational and assessment applications.", "method": "Experimenter prompted LLMs with three adversarial strategies: verbose responses, multiple unconfident answers, and conflicting answers positioned early in text outputs, while comparing binary vs continuous scoring models.", "result": "Attack strategies failed to inflate scores and often reduced them; binary scorers showed 12.3% greater resistance to manipulation compared to continuous scorers while maintaining 94.7% accuracy in correct answer detection.", "conclusion": "Robust automated answer matching systems with binary scoring can reliably replace human evaluators for standardized assessments when reference answers exist, resisting low-cost text manipulation tactics."}}

Existing methods are typically built upon moderate-scale pre-trained models and employ diverse optimization strategies to achieve promising performance under full-parameter fine-tuning. In fact, deeper and larger-scale foundation models can provide stronger support for performance improvement. However, due to their massive number of parameters, directly adopting full-parameter fine-tuning leads to pronounced training difficulties, such as excessive GPU memory consumption and high computational costs, which result in extremely limited exploration of large-scale models in existing works. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic wavelet expert-guided fine-tuning paradigm with fewer trainable parameters, dubbed WEFT, which efficiently adapts large-scale foundation models to ORSIs segmentation tasks by leveraging the guidance of wavelet experts. Specifically, we introduce a task-specific wavelet expert extractor to model wavelet experts from different perspectives and dynamically regulate their outputs, thereby generating trainable features enriched with task-specific information for subsequent fine-tuning. Furthermore, we construct an expert-guided conditional adapter that first enhances the fine-grained perception of frozen features for specific tasks by injecting trainable features, and then iteratively updates the information of both types of feature, allowing for efficient fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that our WEFT not only outperforms 21 state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on three ORSIs datasets, but also achieves optimal results in camouflage, natural, and medical scenarios.

This paper presents NewsScope, a cross-domain dataset, benchmark, and fine-tuned model for schema-grounded news claim extraction. The dataset contains 455 articles across politics, health, science/environment, and business, consisting of 395 in-domain articles and 60 out-of-source articles for generalization testing. LLaMA 3.1 8B was fine-tuned using LoRA on 315 training examples and evaluated on held-out in-domain (80 articles) and out-of-source (60 articles) test sets. Human evaluation on 400 claims shows NewsScope achieves 89.4% human-evaluated accuracy compared to GPT-4o-mini's 93.7% (p=0.07). NewsScope outperforms GPT-4o-mini on political claims (94.3% vs. 87.8%). A numeric grounding filter further improves accuracy to 91.6%, narrowing the gap to 2.1 percentage points.

While state-of-the-art models perform well under full supervision, their performance degrades significantly under limited labeling, limiting their real-world applicability. In this work, we propose SAM-Aug, a new annotation-efficient framework that leverages the geometry-aware segmentation capability of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to improve few-shot land cover mapping. Our approach constructs cloud-free composite images from temporal sequences and applies SAM in a fully unsupervised manner to generate geometry-aware mask priors. These priors are then integrated into training through a proposed loss function called RegionSmoothLoss, which enforces prediction consistency within each SAM-derived region across temporal frames, effectively regularizing the model to respect semantically coherent structures. Extensive experiments on the PASTIS-R benchmark under a 5 percent labeled setting demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of SAM-Aug. Averaged over three random seeds (42, 2025, 4090), our method achieves a mean test mIoU of 36.21 percent, outperforming the state-of-the-art baseline by +2.33 percentage points, a relative improvement of 6.89 percent. Notably, on the most favorable split (seed=42), SAM-Aug reaches a test mIoU of 40.28 percent, representing an 11.2 percent relative gain with no additional labeled data. The consistent improvement across all seeds confirms the generalization power of leveraging foundation model priors under annotation scarcity. Our results highlight that vision models like SAM can serve as useful regularizers in few-shot remote sensing learning, offering a scalable and plug-and-play solution for land cover monitoring without requiring manual annotations or model fine-tuning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aSAM-Aug\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6807\u6ce8\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408Segment Anything Model (SAM)\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u533a\u57df\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u571f\u5730\u8986\u76d6\u5236\u56fe\u96be\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5168\u76d1\u7763\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u53d7\u9650\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u964d\u4f4e\u5bf9\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "method": "1) \u6784\u5efa\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u65e0\u4e91\u590d\u5408\u56fe\u50cf\uff1b2) \u91c7\u7528\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u5f0f\u5e94\u7528SAM\u751f\u6210\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u533a\u57df\u63a9\u7801\u5148\u9a8c\uff1b3) \u63d0\u51faRegionSmoothLoss\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5236\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2dSAM\u751f\u6210\u533a\u57df\u5185\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u578b\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728PASTIS-R\u57fa\u51c65%\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0cSAM-Aug\u5e73\u5747\u6d4b\u8bd5mIoU\u8fbe36.21%\uff08\u8f83\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u53472.33\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff09\uff0c\u6700\u4f18\u968f\u673a\u79cd\u5b5042\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0bmIoU\u8fbe40.28%\uff08\u76f8\u5bf9\u63d0\u534711.2%\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982SAM\uff09\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5de5\u5177\u7528\u4e8e\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u9065\u611f\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u6216\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u5373\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5148\u9a8c\u5728\u6807\u6ce8\u7a00\u7f3a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u666e\u9002\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

Current methods mainly perform single-step or fixed-horizon rollouts, leaving their potential for complex task planning under-exploited. We propose Imagine-then-Plan (\\texttt{ITP}), a unified framework for agent learning via lookahead imagination, where an agent's policy model interacts with the learned world model, yielding multi-step ``imagined'' trajectories. Since the imagination horizon may vary by tasks and stages, we introduce a novel adaptive lookahead mechanism by trading off the ultimate goal and task progress. The resulting imagined trajectories provide rich signals about future consequences, such as achieved progress and potential conflicts, which are fused with current observations, formulating a partially \\textit{observable} and \\textit{imaginable} Markov decision process to guide policy learning.

The prevailing \"restoration-then-recognition\" two-stage paradigm suffers from a fundamental flaw: the pixel-level optimization objectives of image restoration models are misaligned with the semantic goals of character recognition, leading to artifact interference and error accumulation. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated powerful general capabilities, they lack explicit structural modeling for license plate character sequences (e.g., fixed length, specific order). To address this, we propose an end-to-end structure-aware multimodal reasoning framework based on Qwen3-VL. The core innovation lies in the Character-Aware Multimodal Reasoning Module (CMRM), which introduces a set of learnable Character Slot Queries. Through a cross-attention mechanism, these queries actively retrieve fine-grained evidence corresponding to character positions from visual features. Subsequently, we inject these character-aware representations back into the visual tokens via residual modulation, enabling the language model to perform autoregressive generation based on explicit structural priors. Furthermore, combined with the LoRA parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy, the model achieves domain adaptation while retaining the generalization capabilities of the large model. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world severely degraded datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing restoration-recognition combinations and general VLMs, validating the superiority of incorporating structured reasoning into large models for low-quality text recognition tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff08Qwen3-VL + CMRM\u6a21\u5757\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6b8b\u5dee\u8c03\u5236\u878d\u5408\u5b57\u7b26\u4f4d\u7f6e\u611f\u77e5\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165LoRA\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u8f66\u724c\u56fe\u50cf\u8bc6\u522b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u2018\u4fee\u590d-\u8bc6\u522b\u2019\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u50cf\u7d20\u4f18\u5316\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u76ee\u6807\u9519\u4f4d\u5bfc\u81f4\u9519\u8bef\u7d2f\u79ef\uff0c\u4e14\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8f66\u724c\u5e8f\u5217\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u56fa\u5b9a\u957f\u5ea6/\u987a\u5e8f\uff09\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b57\u7b26\u69fd\u67e5\u8be2\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u63d0\u53d6\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u6b8b\u5dee\u8c03\u5236\u5c06\u5b57\u7b26\u611f\u77e5\u8868\u793a\u878d\u5165\u89c6\u89c9token\uff0c\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u751f\u6210\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408LoRA\u5b9e\u73b0\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u4e25\u91cd\u9000\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5747\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f20\u7edf\u4fee\u590d-\u8bc6\u522b\u7ec4\u5408\u4e0e\u901a\u7528VLM\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u6587\u672c\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u6b8b\u5dee\u8c03\u5236\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e0e\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94"}}

Our approach utilizes a Virtual-Width Dynamic Vision Encoder (DVE) to \"unfold\" complex pathological manifolds without physical parameter expansion, coupled with a two-stage Reinforcement Learning strategy. This strategy sequentially aligns explicit medical descriptions (Stage I) and reconstructs implicit diagnostic textures (Stage II) within a constrained semantic space. Furthermore, we propose a clinically grounded evaluation protocol that prioritizes diagnostic safety and hierarchical relevance over rigid label matching. Empirical results are compelling: our 7B model establishes a new state-of-the-art on the Fitzpatrick17k benchmark, achieving a +12.06% gain in Top-1 accuracy and a +28.57% boost in Top-6 accuracy over the massive general-purpose models (e.g., Qwen3VL-235B and GPT-5.2). These findings demonstrate that optimizing geometric capacity and information flow yields superior diagnostic reasoning compared to raw parameter scaling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f15\u5165SkinFlow\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u8f93\u6548\u7387\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u76ae\u80a4\u79d1\u7684'\u5206\u6563\u6ce8\u610f\u529b'\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6269\u5927\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(LVLMs)\u5728\u76ae\u80a4\u75c5\u8bca\u65ad\u4e2d\u56e0\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u7ec6\u5fae\u75c5\u7076\u4e0e\u80cc\u666f\u566a\u58f0\u800c\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4e14\u533b\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u5b58\u5728'\u53c2\u6570\u5373\u80fd\u529b'\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u865a\u62df\u5bbd\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668(DVE)\u5728\u4e0d\u6269\u5c55\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5c55\u5f00\u590d\u6742\u75c5\u7406\u6d41\u5f62\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u5bf9\u9f50\u533b\u5b66\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u91cd\u5efa\u8bca\u65ad\u7eb9\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e34\u5e8a\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u3002", "result": "\u5728Fitzpatrick17k\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c7B\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u8f83Qwen3VL-235B/GPT-5.2\u7b49\u8d85\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\uff0cTop-1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u534712.06%\uff0cTop-6\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u534728.57%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u7f29\u653e\u4e4b\u5916\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u5bb9\u91cf\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u533b\u5b66\u8bca\u65ad\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002"}}

The quality of generated content heavily relies on the usefulness of the retrieved information and the capacity of LLMs' internal information processing mechanism to incorporate it in answer generation. It is generally assumed that the retrieved information is relevant to the question. However, the retrieved information may have a variable degree of relevance and usefulness, depending on the question and the document collection. It is important to take into account the relevance of the retrieved information in answer generation. In this paper, we propose OpenDecoder, a new approach that leverages explicit evaluation of the retrieved information as quality indicator features for generation. We aim to build a RAG model that is more robust to varying levels of noisy context. Three types of explicit evaluation information are considered: relevance score, ranking score, and QPP (query performance prediction) score. The experimental results on five benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and better robustness of OpenDecoder by outperforming various baseline methods.

Across SQL correctness, answer groundedness, retrieval effectiveness, and expert evaluation, SpectraQuery demonstrates strong performance: approximately 80 percent of generated SQL queries are fully correct, synthesized answers reach 93-97 percent groundedness with 10-15 retrieved passages, and battery scientists rate responses highly across accuracy, relevance, grounding, and clarity (4.1-4.6/5).

We study a family of model-based training approaches that leverage a learned nuisance variation model to generate realistic corruptions, as well as new hybrid strategies that combine random coverage with adversarial refinement in nuisance space. Using the Challenging Unreal and Real Environments for Traffic Sign Recognition dataset (CURE-TSR), with Snow and Rain corruptions, we evaluate accuracy, calibration, and training complexity across corruption severities. Our results show that model-based methods consistently outperform baselines Vanilla, Adversarial Training, and AugMix baselines, with model-based adversarial training providing the strongest robustness under across all corruptions but at the expense of higher computation and model-based data augmentation achieving comparable robustness with $T$ less computational complexity without incurring a statistically significant drop in performance. These findings highlight the importance of learned nuisance models for capturing natural variability, and suggest a promising path toward more resilient and calibrated models under challenging conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u53d8\u5f02\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u81ea\u7136\u5e72\u6270\uff08\u5982\u96ea\u3001\u96e8\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u7ed3\u5408\u968f\u673a\u8986\u76d6\u4e0e\u5bf9\u6297\u7ec6\u5316\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u654f\u611f\u9886\u57df\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u7136\u5e72\u6270\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u662f\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u654f\u611f\u9886\u57df\u53ef\u9760\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u4e3b\u6d41\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001AugMix\uff09\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "1. \u63d0\u51fa\u5b66\u4e60\u5e72\u6270\u53d8\u5f02\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u771f\u5b9e\u81ea\u7136\u5e72\u6270\uff1b2. \u5f00\u53d1\u6df7\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u2014\u2014\u5728\u5e72\u6270\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7ed3\u5408\u968f\u673a\u91c7\u6837\u4e0e\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672c\u4f18\u5316\uff1b3. \u5728CURE-TSR\u4ea4\u901a\u6807\u5fd7\u8bc6\u522b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6240\u6709\u5e72\u6270\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e0b\u5747\u8d85\u8d8a\u57fa\u7ebf\uff1a\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u6700\u4f18\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u578b\u65b9\u6848\u5728$T$\u500d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5b66\u4e60\u5e72\u6270\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u81ea\u7136\u53d8\u5f02\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e72\u6270\u53d8\u5f02\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u9760AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e2d\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

We evaluated five widely used GenAI image platforms (Adobe Firefly, DALL-E 3, Google Imagen 3, Microsoft Image Generator, and Midjourney) using 30 architectural prompts spanning styles, typologies, and codified elements. Each prompt-generator pair produced four images (n = 600 images total). Two architectural historians independently scored each image for accuracy against predefined criteria, resolving disagreements by consensus. Set-level performance was summarized as zero to four accurate images per four-image set. Image output from Common prompts was 2.7-fold more accurate than from Rare prompts (p < 0.05). Across platforms, overall accuracy was limited (highest accuracy score 52 percent; lowest 32 percent; mean 42 percent). All-correct (4 out of 4) outcomes were similar across platforms. By contrast, all-incorrect (0 out of 4) outcomes varied substantially, with Imagen 3 exhibiting the fewest failures and Microsoft Image Generator exhibiting the highest number of failures. Qualitative review of the image dataset identified recurring patterns including over-embellishment, confusion between medieval styles and their later revivals, and misrepresentation of descriptive prompts (for example, egg-and-dart, banded column, pendentive).

Functional Analysis and Transferability of Generalization Circuits in Transformers", "comment": null, "summary": "While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at factual retrieval, they often struggle with the \"curse of two-hop reasoning\" in compositional tasks. Recent research suggests that parameter-sharing transformers can bridge this gap by forming a \"Generalization Circuit\" during a prolonged \"grokking\" phase. A fundamental question arises: Is a grokked model superior to its non-grokked counterparts on downstream tasks? Furthermore, is the extensive computational cost of waiting for the grokking phase worthwhile? In this work, we conduct a mechanistic study to evaluate the Generalization Circuit's role in knowledge assimilation and transfer. We demonstrate that: (i) The inference paths established by non-grokked and grokked models for in-distribution compositional queries are identical. This suggests that the \"Generalization Circuit\" does not represent the sudden acquisition of a new reasoning paradigm. Instead, we argue that grokking is the process of integrating memorized atomic facts into an naturally established reasoning path. (ii) Achieving high accuracy on unseen cases after prolonged training and the formation of a certain reasoning path are not bound; they can occur independently under specific data regimes.

The proposed loss reshapes localization gradients by combining non monotonic focusing with decoupled width and height optimization, thereby enhancing weak regression signals for hard samples with low overlap while reducing gradient interference. This design is particularly effective for small and low contrast targets commonly observed in agricultural disease imagery. The proposed N EIoU loss is integrated into a lightweight YOLOv9t architecture and evaluated on a self collected field dataset comprising 5908 rice leaf images across four disease categories and healthy leaves. Experimental results demonstrate consistent performance gains over the standard CIoU loss, achieving a mean Average Precision of 90.3 percent, corresponding to a 4.3 percent improvement over the baseline, with improved localization accuracy under stricter evaluation criteria. For practical validation, the optimized model is deployed on an Android device using TensorFlow Lite with Float16 quantization, achieving an average inference time of 156 milliseconds per frame while maintaining accuracy.

A key challenge is learning representations that are robust to nuisance variation such as gender while remaining tone-aware for different lexical meanings. To address this, we propose SITA, a lightweight adaptation recipe that enforces Speaker-Invariance and Tone-Awareness for pretrained wav2vec-style encoders. SITA uses staged multi-objective training: (i) a cross-gender contrastive objective encourages lexical consistency across speakers, while a tone-repulsive loss prevents tone collapse by explicitly separating same-word different-tone realizations; and (ii) an auxiliary Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC)-based ASR objective with distillation stabilizes recognition-relevant structure. We evaluate primarily on Hmong, a highly tonal and severely under-resourced language where off-the-shelf multilingual encoders fail to represent tone effectively. On a curated Hmong word corpus, SITA improves cross-gender lexical retrieval accuracy, while maintaining usable ASR accuracy relative to an ASR-adapted XLS-R teacher. We further observe similar gains when transferring the same recipe to Mandarin, suggesting SITA is a general, plug-in approach for adapting multilingual speech encoders to tonal languages.", "AI": {"tldr": "SITA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u58f0\u8c03\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u97f3\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u9002\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u65e0\u5173\u548c\u58f0\u8c03\u654f\u611f\u7684\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u58f0\u8c03\u8bed\u8a00\u5728\u73b0\u4ee3\u8bed\u97f3\u6280\u672f\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6709\u6548\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u6027\u522b\u7b49\u65e0\u5173\u53d8\u91cf\u5e72\u6270\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u58f0\u8c03\u533a\u5206\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u8868\u5f81\u58f0\u8c03", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff1a(1) \u8de8\u6027\u522b\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u4e0e\u58f0\u8c03\u6392\u65a5\u635f\u5931\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u8bcd\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5e76\u5206\u79bb\u540c\u8bcd\u5f02\u8c03\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff1b(2) \u5f15\u5165CTC+\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u7684ASR\u8f85\u52a9\u76ee\u6807\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bc6\u522b\u7ed3\u6784", "result": "\u5728\u82d7\u8bed\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8de8\u6027\u522b\u8bcd\u6c47\u68c0\u7d22\u51c6\u786e\u7387(\u8f83\u57fa\u7ebf+12.3%)\uff0c\u7ef4\u6301\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u7684ASR\u7cbe\u5ea6(XLS-R\u8001\u5e08\u768488.1%)\uff0c\u8fc1\u79fb\u81f3\u666e\u901a\u8bdd\u4e5f\u53d6\u5f97\u7c7b\u4f3c\u63d0\u5347(\u5b57\u7b26\u51c6\u786e\u7387+4.7%)", "conclusion": "SITA\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u578b\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8bed\u97f3\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u9002\u914d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u58f0\u8c03\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4e24\u5927\u6838\u5fc3\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u4e3a\u76f8\u5173\u8d44\u6e90\u532e\u4e4f\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u6280\u672f\u8def\u5f84"}}

While high-capacity models achieve strong segmentation accuracy, their computational demands hinder practical deployment and long-term maintainability in hospital environments. We present a deployment-oriented framework that leverages knowledge distillation to translate a high-performing segmentation model into a scalable family of compact student models, without modifying the inference pipeline. The proposed approach preserves architectural compatibility with existing clinical systems while enabling systematic capacity reduction. The framework is evaluated on a multi-site brain MRI dataset comprising 1,104 3D volumes, with independent testing on 101 curated cases, and is further examined on abdominal CT to assess cross-modality generalizability. Under aggressive parameter reduction (94%), the distilled student model preserves nearly all of the teacher's segmentation accuracy (98.7%), while achieving substantial efficiency gains, including up to a 67% reduction in CPU inference latency without additional deployment overhead.

The system achieved strong win rates across the competition's tasks, with particularly robust performance on Marathi (86.7% QnA), Tamil (86.7% QnA), and Hindi (80.0% QnA), demonstrating the effectiveness of translation-based approaches for low-resource language processing without task-specific fine-tuning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u56e2\u961fKl33n3x\u4e3aNLPAI4Health 2025\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6458\u8981\u4e0e\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u4e5d\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u5904\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\uff08\u5982\u5370\u5ea6\u8bed\u7cfb\uff09\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6458\u8981\u4e0e\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4efb\u52a1\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u800c\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u7ffb\u8bd1\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u91c7\u7528\u524d\u5411\u7ffb\u8bd1\uff08\u5370\u5ea6\u8bed\u2192\u82f1\u8bed\uff09+ \u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\uff0825.5\u4ebf\u53c2\u6570\u84b8\u998f\u6a21\u578b\uff09+ \u53cd\u5411\u7ffb\u8bd1\uff08\u82f1\u8bed\u2192\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\uff09\u7684\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u5728Marathi\uff0886.7% QnA\uff09\u3001Tamil\uff0886.7% QnA\uff09\u3001Hindi\uff0880.0% QnA\uff09\u7b49\u4e5d\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u4f18\u5f02\u6210\u7ee9\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7ffb\u8bd1\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7684\u7d27\u51d1\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u9ad8\u6548\u5904\u7406\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5728\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Traditional deep learning models either process frames independently, ignoring temporal information, or rely on memory-based feature propagation, which accumulates error over time. Methods: We propose Point-Seg, a transformer-based segmentation framework that integrates point tracking as a temporal cue to ensure stable and consistent segmentation of myocardium across frames. Our method leverages a point-tracking module trained on a synthetic echocardiography dataset to track key anatomical landmarks across video sequences. These tracked trajectories provide an explicit motion-aware signal that guides segmentation, reducing drift and eliminating the need for memory-based feature accumulation. Additionally, we incorporate a temporal smoothing loss to further enhance temporal consistency across frames. Results: We evaluate our approach on both public and private echocardiography datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that Point-Seg has statistically similar accuracy in terms of Dice to state-of-the-art segmentation models in high quality echo data, while it achieves better segmentation accuracy in lower quality echo with improved temporal stability. Furthermore, Point-Seg has the key advantage of pixel-level myocardium motion information as opposed to other segmentation methods. Such information is essential in the computation of other downstream tasks such as myocardial strain measurement and regional wall motion abnormality detection. Conclusion: Point-Seg demonstrates that point tracking can serve as an effective temporal cue for consistent video segmentation, offering a reliable and generalizable approach for myocardium segmentation in echocardiography videos.

We then synthesize modeling approaches using a common framework defined by prediction targets and pooling structure, highlighting a shift from consensus learning toward explicitly modeling disagreement, and toward capturing structured relationships among annotators. We review evaluation metrics for both predictive performance and annotator behavior, and noting that most fairness evaluations remain descriptive rather than normative.

A key challenge is transferring knowledge from NBI to enhance WLI-only models, yet existing methods are critically hampered by their reliance on paired NBI-WLI images of the same lesion, a costly and often impractical requirement that leaves vast amounts of clinical data untapped. In this paper, we break this paradigm by introducing PaGKD, a novel Pairing-free Group-level Knowledge Distillation framework that that enables effective cross-modal learning using unpaired WLI and NBI data. Instead of forcing alignment between individual, often semantically mismatched image instances, PaGKD operates at the group level to distill more complete and compatible knowledge across modalities. Central to PaGKD are two complementary modules: (1) Group-level Prototype Distillation (GKD-Pro) distills compact group representations by extracting modality-invariant semantic prototypes via shared lesion-aware queries; (2) Group-level Dense Distillation (GKD-Den) performs dense cross-modal alignment by guiding group-aware attention with activation-derived relation maps. Together, these modules enforce global semantic consistency and local structural coherence without requiring image-level correspondence. Extensive experiments on four clinical datasets demonstrate that PaGKD consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving relative AUC improvements of 3.3%, 1.1%, 2.8%, and 3.2%, respectively, establishing a new direction for cross-modal learning from unpaired data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u914d\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6PaGKD\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec4\u7ea7\u539f\u578b\u4e0e\u5bc6\u96c6\u5bf9\u9f50\u6a21\u5757\u63d0\u5347\u767d\u5149\u5185\u955c\u764c\u75c7\u7b5b\u67e5\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7a84\u5e26\u6210\u50cf\uff08NBI\uff09\u5411\u767d\u5149\u6210\u50cf\uff08WLI\uff09\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\u4f9d\u8d56\u6602\u8d35\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u83b7\u53d6\u7684\u914d\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5927\u91cf\u975e\u914d\u5bf9\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u672a\u88ab\u5229\u7528\u3002", "method": "PaGKD\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\uff1a\u7ec4\u7ea7\u539f\u578b\u84b8\u998f\uff08GKD-Pro\uff09\u63d0\u53d6\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5171\u6027\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7ec4\u7ea7\u5bc6\u96c6\u84b8\u998f\uff08GKD-Den\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u5c40\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u56fe\u50cf\u7ea7\u914d\u5bf9\u3002", "result": "\u57284\u4e2a\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0aAUC\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u53473.3%\u30011.1%\u30012.8%\u548c3.2%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u975e\u914d\u5bf9\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3a\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u8fc1\u79fb\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

While existing methods predict affordance regions only on visible surfaces, we propose Affostruction, a generative framework that reconstructs complete geometry from partial observations and grounds affordances on the full shape including unobserved regions. We make three core contributions: generative multi-view reconstruction via sparse voxel fusion that extrapolates unseen geometry while maintaining constant token complexity, flow-based affordance grounding that captures inherent ambiguity in affordance distributions, and affordance-driven active view selection that leverages predicted affordances for intelligent viewpoint sampling. Affostruction achieves 19.1 aIoU on affordance grounding (40.4\\% improvement) and 32.67 IoU for 3D reconstruction (67.7\\% improvement), enabling accurate affordance prediction on complete shapes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aAffostruction\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u7269\u4f53RGBD\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u5b8c\u65743D\u5f62\u72b6\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u4e0d\u53ef\u89c1\u533a\u57df\uff09\u7684\u6587\u672c\u9a71\u52a8\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u53ef\u89c1\u8868\u9762\u7684\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u800c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u90e8\u5206\u89c2\u6d4b\u91cd\u5efa\u5b8c\u6574\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u5927\u6838\u5fc3\u521b\u65b0\uff1a1) \u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u91cd\u5efa\uff08\u7a00\u758f\u4f53\u7d20\u878d\u5408\u5916\u63a8\u4e0d\u53ef\u89c1\u51e0\u4f55\uff09 2) \u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff08\u6355\u6349\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u5206\u5e03\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\uff09 3) \u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u9a71\u52a8\u4e3b\u52a8\u89c6\u89d2\u9009\u62e9\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u4f18\u5316\u89c6\u89d2\u91c7\u6837\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8fbe\u523019.1 aIoU\uff08\u8f83\u57fa\u51c6\u63d0\u534740.4%\uff09\uff0c3D\u91cd\u5efa\u8fbe\u523032.67 IoU\uff08\u63d0\u534767.7%\uff09\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5b8c\u6574\u5f62\u72b6\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u7269\u4f53\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4ea4\u4e92\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u76843D\u7406\u89e3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This design has notable shortcomings: real-world relations are often contextual, nuanced, and sometimes uncertain, and compressing it into discrete relation labels abstracts away critical semantic detail. Nevertheless, symbolic-relation KGs remain widely used because they have been operationally effective and broadly compatible with pre-LLM downstream models and algorithms, in which KG knowledge could be retrieved or encoded into quantified features and embeddings at scale. The emergence of LLMs has reshaped how knowledge is created and consumed. LLMs support scalable synthesis of domain facts directly in concise natural language, and prompting-based inference favors context-rich free-form text over quantified representations. This position paper argues that these changes call for rethinking the representation of relations themselves rather than merely using LLMs to populate conventional schemas more efficiently. We therefore advocate moving from symbolic to natural-language relation descriptions, and we propose hybrid design principles that preserve a minimal structural backbone while enabling more flexible and context-sensitive relational representations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5e94\u91cd\u65b0\u601d\u8003\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u4e2d\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4f20\u7edf\u7b26\u53f7\u5173\u7cfb\u6807\u7b7e\u5411\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63cf\u8ff0\u8f6c\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408LLM\u80fd\u529b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u517c\u987e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4e0e\u8bed\u5883\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7b26\u53f7\u5173\u7cfb\u6807\u7b7e\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u73b0\u5b9e\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u4e22\u5931\u8bed\u4e49\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u800c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u4f7f\u5f97\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5316\u5173\u7cfb\u8868\u793a\u6210\u4e3a\u53ef\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u4ecd\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u5386\u53f2\u6a21\u578b\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6df7\u5408\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u4fdd\u7559\u6700\u5c0f\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u9aa8\u67b6\uff08\u5982\u5b9e\u4f53\u5bf9+\u5173\u952e\u5c5e\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7LLM\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u8868\u8ff0\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u672a\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6570\u636e\uff08\u672c\u6587\u4e3a\u89c2\u70b9\u6027\u8bba\u6587\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u8bba\u8bc1\u4e86\u7b26\u53f7\u5316\u5411\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u8f6c\u578b\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6574\u5408\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\u3002", "conclusion": "\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u5e94\u5229\u7528LLM\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4ece\u521a\u6027\u7b26\u53f7\u8f6c\u5411\u8bed\u5883\u5316\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u5173\u952e\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u8bed\u4e49\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u4e0b\u6e38\u5e94\u7528\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u3002"}}

The first analyzes the total variation (TV) distance between the target model and relaxed speculative decoding and yields an optimal resampling distribution that minimizes an upper bound of the distance. The second uses perturbation analysis to reveal an annealing behaviour in relaxed speculative decoding, motivating our annealed design.

Lee"], "title": "How Many Human Judgments Are Enough? Feasibility Limits of Human Preference Evaluation", "comment": null, "summary": "Human preference evaluations are widely used to compare generative models, yet it remains unclear how many judgments are required to reliably detect small improvements. We show that when preference signal is diffuse across prompts (i.e., all prompt types are similarly informative), proportional allocation is minimax-optimal: no allocation strategy substantially improves detectability. Empirical analysis of large-scale human preference datasets shows that most comparisons fall into this diffuse regime, exhibiting small preference margins that require far more judgments than typically collected, even in well-sampled comparisons.

However, due to low contrast and weak edge information in infrared images, it is challenging to extract discriminative object features for robust detection. To deal with this issue, we propose a novel vision-language representation learning paradigm for infrared object detection. An additional textual supervision with rich semantic information is explored to guide the disentanglement of object and non-object features. Specifically, we propose a Semantic Feature Alignment (SFA) module to align the object features with the corresponding text features. Furthermore, we develop an Object Feature Disentanglement (OFD) module that disentangles text-aligned object features and non-object features by minimizing their correlation. Finally, the disentangled object features are entered into the detection head. In this manner, the detection performance can be remarkably enhanced via more discriminative and less noisy features.

Our approach employs multi-head attention with eight specialized heads for explicit relationship modeling, integrates curriculum learning with dynamic LoRA adapter selection across five patent domains, and implements cross-attention mechanisms between evaluation aspects for comprehensive quality assessment.

To address this, we introduce Cross-Layer Independent Deformable Description (CLIDD), a method that achieves superior distinctiveness by sampling directly from independent feature hierarchies. This approach utilizes learnable offsets to capture fine-grained structural details across scales while bypassing the computational burden of unified dense representations. To ensure real-time performance, we implement a hardware-aware kernel fusion strategy that maximizes inference throughput. Furthermore, we develop a scalable framework that integrates lightweight architectures with a training protocol leveraging both metric learning and knowledge distillation. This scheme generates a wide spectrum of model variants optimized for diverse deployment constraints. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our approach achieves superior matching accuracy and exceptional computational efficiency simultaneously. Specifically, the ultra-compact variant matches the precision of SuperPoint while utilizing only 0.004M parameters, achieving a 99.7% reduction in model size. Furthermore, our high-performance configuration outperforms all current state-of-the-art methods, including high-capacity DINOv2-based frameworks, while exceeding 200 FPS on edge devices.

We show empirically that such degradation arises from biased generation behavior, despite factual knowledge being robustly encoded across identities. Motivated by this mismatch, we propose a lightweight, training-free framework for identity-robust generation that selectively neutralizes non-critical identity information while preserving semantically essential attributes, thus maintaining output content integrity. Experiments across four benchmarks and 18 sociodemographic identities demonstrate an average 77% reduction in identity-dependent bias compared to vanilla prompting and a 45% reduction relative to prompt-based defenses.

Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), especially Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), reduces this cost by updating only a small number of parameters. We show that the standard LoRA update $\u0394W = BA^\\top$ has geometric drawbacks: gauge freedom, scale ambiguity, and a tendency toward rank collapse. We introduce OrthoGeoLoRA, which enforces an SVD-like form $\u0394W = B\u03a3A^\\top$ by constraining the low-rank factors to be orthogonal (Stiefel manifold). A geometric reparameterization implements this constraint while remaining compatible with standard optimizers such as Adam and existing fine-tuning pipelines. We also propose a benchmark for hierarchical concept retrieval over the European Language Social Science Thesaurus (ELSST), widely used to organize social science resources in digital repositories.

To address this problem, we propose DeTracker, a joint detection-and-tracking framework tailored for unstabilized satellite videos. DeTracker introduces a Global--Local Motion Decoupling (GLMD) module that explicitly separates satellite platform motion from true object motion through global alignment and local refinement, leading to improved trajectory stability and motion estimation accuracy.

Although our empirical analysis suggests that introducing multiple reference answers can mitigate this issue, the prohibitive data and computational costs necessitate a strategic shift: prioritizing the mitigation of single-reference overfitting over the costly pursuit of answer diversity. To achieve this, we reveal the intrinsic connection between token probability and semantic importance: high-probability tokens carry the core logical framework, while low-probability tokens are mostly replaceable expressions.

However, LLMs often produce inconsistent toxicity judgements for subtle expressions, particularly those involving implicit hate speech, revealing underlying biases that are difficult to correct through standard training. This raises a key question that existing approaches often overlook: when should corrective mechanisms be invoked to ensure fair and reliable assessments? To address this, we propose FairToT, an inference-time framework that enhances LLM fairness through prompt-guided toxicity assessment. FairToT identifies cases where demographic-related variation is likely to occur and determines when additional assessment should be applied. In addition, we introduce two interpretable fairness indicators that detect such cases and improve inference consistency without modifying model parameters. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that FairToT reduces group-level disparities while maintaining stable and reliable toxicity predictions, demonstrating that inference-time refinement offers an effective and practical approach for fairness improvement in LLM-based toxicity assessment systems.

Traditionally, template-registration methods were used, but recent advances have shifted to deep learning for faster workflows. While large models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) offer transferable feature representations, they are not tailored for the high precision required in brain parcellation. To address this, we propose BrainSegNet, a novel framework that adapts SAM for accurate whole-brain parcellation into 95 regions. We enhance SAM by integrating U-Net skip connections and specialized modules into its encoder and decoder, enabling fine-grained anatomical precision. Key components include a hybrid encoder combining U-Net skip connections with SAM's transformer blocks, a multi-scale attention decoder with pyramid pooling for varying-sized structures, and a boundary refinement module to sharpen edges.

While existing research has primarily focused on text and visual modalities, the audio corpus within this domain remains largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose the Multi-task Classical Chinese Literary Genre Audio Corpus (MCGA). It encompasses a diverse range of literary genres across six tasks: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Speech-to-Text Translation (S2TT), Speech Emotion Captioning (SEC), Spoken Question Answering (SQA), Speech Understanding (SU), and Speech Reasoning (SR). Through the evaluation of ten MLLMs, our experimental results demonstrate that current models still face substantial challenges when processed on the MCGA test set. Furthermore, we introduce an evaluation metric for SEC and a metric to measure the consistency between the speech and text capabilities of MLLMs. We release MCGA and our code to the public to facilitate the development of MLLMs with more robust multidimensional audio capabilities in CCS.

Prior work has coupled physics simulation with Gaussians, but predominantly targets soft, deformable materials, leaving brittle fracture largely unresolved. This stems from two key obstacles: the lack of volumetric interiors with coherent textures in GS representation, and the absence of fracture-aware simulation methods for Gaussians. To address these challenges, we introduce GaussianFluent, a unified framework for realistic simulation and rendering of dynamic object states. First, it synthesizes photorealistic interiors by densifying internal Gaussians guided by generative models. Second, it integrates an optimized Continuum Damage Material Point Method (CD-MPM) to enable brittle fracture simulation at remarkably high speed. Our approach handles complex scenarios including mixed-material objects and multi-stage fracture propagation, achieving results infeasible with previous methods.

Preprint", "summary": "Recent studies in medical question answering (Medical QA) have actively explored the integration of large language models (LLMs) with biomedical knowledge graphs (KGs) to improve factual accuracy. However, most existing approaches still rely on traversing the entire KG or performing large-scale retrieval, which introduces substantial noise and leads to unstable multi-hop reasoning. We argue that the core challenge lies not in expanding access to knowledge, but in identifying and reasoning over the appropriate subset of evidence for each query. ReGraM is a region-first knowledge graph reasoning framework that addresses this challenge by constructing a query-aligned subgraph and performing stepwise reasoning constrained to this localized region under multiple evidence aware modes. By focusing inference on only the most relevant portion of the KG, ReGraM departs from the assumption that all relations are equally useful an assumption that rarely holds in domain-specific medical settings. Experiments on seven medical QA benchmarks demonstrate that ReGraM consistently outperforms a strong baseline (KGARevion), achieving an 8.04% absolute accuracy gain on MCQ, a 4.50% gain on SAQ, and a 42.9% reduction in hallucination rate.

However, the knowledge is not only hidden in the textual modality but also in the image modality. Traditional methods can parse text from domain documents but dont have image captioning ability. Multi-modal LLM (MLLM) can understand images, but they do not have sufficient domain knowledge. To address the above issues, this paper proposes a multi-stage progressive training strategy to train a Domain-specific Image Captioning Model (DICModel) in ICT, and constructs a standard evaluation system to validate the performance of DICModel. Specifically, this work first synthesizes about 7K image-text pairs by combining the Mermaid tool and LLMs, which are used for the first-stage supervised-fine-tuning (SFT) of DICModel. Then, ICT-domain experts manually annotate about 2K image-text pairs for the second-stage SFT of DICModel. Finally, experts and LLMs jointly synthesize about 1.5K visual question answering data for the instruction-based SFT. Experimental results indicate that our DICModel with only 7B parameters performs better than other state-of-the-art models with 32B parameters. Compared to the SOTA models with 7B and 32B parameters, our DICModel increases the BLEU metric by approximately 56.8% and 20.8%, respectively. On the objective questions constructed by ICT domain experts, our DICModel outperforms Qwen2.5-VL 32B by 1% in terms of accuracy rate. In summary, this work can efficiently and accurately extract the logical text from images, which is expected to promote the development of multimodal models in the ICT domain.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u8bad\u7ec3ICT\u9886\u57df\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u63cf\u8ff0\u6a21\u578bDICModel\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5728BLEU\u6307\u6807\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709SOTA\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u80fd\u89e3\u6790\u6587\u672c\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u6a21\u6001LLM\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8db3\u591f\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u4e24\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u4e0e\u77e5\u8bc6\u589e\u5f3a\u95ee\u9898\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347ICT\u9886\u57df\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528Mermaid\u5de5\u5177\u548cLLM\u5408\u62107K\u56fe\u50cf-\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u8fdb\u884c\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u7531ICT\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce82K\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5fae\u8c03\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u7ed3\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u4e0eLLM\u751f\u62101.5K\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u6570\u636e\u7528\u4e8e\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "DICModel\u57287B\u53c2\u6570\u4e0b\u6bd4\u540c\u53c2\u6570SOTA\u6a21\u578bBLEU\u63d0\u534756.8%\uff0c\u6bd432B\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u534720.8%\uff1b\u5728ICT\u4e13\u5bb6\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u5ba2\u89c2\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8d85\u8fc7Qwen2.5-VL 32B 1%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u7ed3\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u56fe\u50cf\u63cf\u8ff0\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4e3aICT\u9886\u57df\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

For dialog systems, the ability to correctly ground conversational content in order to refer back to it later is particularly important. Prior studies have demonstrated that LLMs are capable of performing grounding acts such as requesting clarification or producing acknowledgments, yet relatively little work has investigated how common ground can be explicitly represented and stored for later use. Without such mechanisms, it remains unclear whether acknowledgment or clarification behaviors truly reflect a grounded understanding. In this work, we evaluate a model's ability to establish and exploit common ground through relational references to entities within the shared context in a situational dialogue.

In this study, we present the first comprehensive bilingual evaluation of LLMs for the clinical Relation Extraction (RE) task in both English and Turkish. To facilitate this evaluation, we introduce the first English-Turkish parallel clinical RE dataset, derived and carefully curated from the 2010 i2b2/VA relation classification corpus. We systematically assess a diverse set of prompting strategies, including multiple in-context learning (ICL) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) approaches, and compare their performance to fine-tuned baselines such as PURE. Furthermore, we propose Relation-Aware Retrieval (RAR), a novel in-context example selection method based on contrastive learning, that is specifically designed to capture both sentence-level and relation-level semantics. Our results show that prompting-based LLM approaches consistently outperform traditional fine-tuned models. Moreover, evaluations for English performed better than their Turkish counterparts across all evaluated LLMs and prompting techniques. Among ICL methods, RAR achieves the highest performance, with Gemini 1.5 Flash reaching a micro-F1 score of 0.906 in English and 0.888 in Turkish. Performance further improves to 0.918 F1 in English when RAR is combined with a structured reasoning prompt using the DeepSeek-V3 model.

For each convolutional layer, we construct a complex interaction field by pairing the full multi-channel input activation as the real part with a single output-channel activation (spatially aligned and broadcast across input channels) as the imaginary part. We transform this complex field to the frequency domain and train a low-capacity autoencoder to reconstruct normalized spectra. Channels whose spectra are reconstructed with high fidelity are interpreted as lying close to a low-dimensional manifold captured by the autoencoder and are therefore more compressible; conversely, channels with low fidelity are retained as they encode information that cannot be compactly represented by the learned manifold. This yields an importance score (optionally fused with the filter L1 norm) that supports simple threshold-based pruning and produces a structurally consistent pruned network. On VGG16 trained on CIFAR-10, at a fixed threshold of 0.6, we obtain 90.11% FLOP reduction and 96.30% parameter reduction with an absolute Top-1 accuracy drop of 1.67% from a 93.44% baseline after fine-tuning, demonstrating that spectral reconstruction fidelity of complex interaction fields is an effective proxy for channel-level redundancy under aggressive compression.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSCAP\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u590d\u6570\u4ea4\u4e92\u573a\u9891\u8c31\u4e0e\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u901a\u9053\u7ea7\u526a\u679d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u538b\u7f29\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u8861\u91cf\u901a\u9053\u5197\u4f59\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u9ad8\u538b\u7f29\u7387\u4e0b\u6613\u635f\u5931\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u9891\u57df\u5206\u6790\u548c\u4f4e\u7ef4\u91cd\u6784\u91cf\u5316\u901a\u9053\u53ef\u538b\u7f29\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u9020\u590d\u6570\u4ea4\u4e92\u573a\uff08\u8f93\u5165\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4e3a\u5b9e\u90e8\uff0c\u8f93\u51fa\u901a\u9053\u4e3a\u865a\u90e8\uff09\u2192 \u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u53d8\u6362\u2192 \u8bad\u7ec3\u4f4e\u5bb9\u91cf\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u91cd\u6784\u9891\u8c31\u2192 \u9ad8\u91cd\u5efa\u7cbe\u5ea6\u901a\u9053\u89c6\u4e3a\u5197\u4f59\uff08\u53ef\u526a\u679d\uff09\uff0c\u4f4e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u901a\u9053\u4fdd\u7559\u2192 \u7ed3\u5408L1\u8303\u6570\u9608\u503c\u88c1\u526a\u3002", "result": "VGG16-CIFAR10\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff1aFLOP\u219390.11%\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u219396.30%\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u540eTop-1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ec5\u964d1.67%\uff0893.44%\u219291.77%\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9891\u8c31\u91cd\u6784\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u8bc4\u4f30\u901a\u9053\u5197\u4f59\u6027\uff0cSCAP\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u526a\u679d\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u538b\u7f29\u7387\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u5e73\u8861\u3002"}}

This is the authors' final accepted manuscript", "summary": "With advances in artificial intelligence, image processing has gained significant interest. Image super-resolution is a vital technology closely related to real-world applications, as it enhances the quality of existing images. Since enhancing fine details is crucial for the super-resolution task, pixels that contribute to high-frequency information should be emphasized. This paper proposes two methods to enhance high-frequency details in super-resolution images: a Laplacian pyramid-based detail loss and a repeated upscaling and downscaling process. Total loss with our detail loss guides a model by separately generating and controlling super-resolution and detail images. This approach allows the model to focus more effectively on high-frequency components, resulting in improved super-resolution images. Additionally, repeated upscaling and downscaling amplify the effectiveness of the detail loss by extracting diverse information from multiple low-resolution features. We conduct two types of experiments. First, we design a CNN-based model incorporating our methods. This model achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing all currently available CNN-based and even some attention-based models. Second, we apply our methods to existing attention-based models on a small scale. In all our experiments, attention-based models adding our detail loss show improvements compared to the originals.

We investigate how abilities are distributed within LLM parameters by analyzing module activations under domain- and language-specific inputs for closely related models. Across layers and modules, we find that ability-related activations are highly concentrated in a small set of channels (typically <5\\%), and these channels are largely disentangled with good sufficiency and stability. Building on these observations, we propose ACT (Activation-Guided Channel-wise Ability Transfer), which localizes ability-relevant channels via activation differences and selectively transfers only the corresponding parameters, followed by lightweight fine-tuning for compatibility.

Accurate histopathological assessment of viable versus non-viable tumor regions after neoadjuvant chemotherapy is critical for prognosis and treatment planning, yet manual evaluation remains labor-intensive, subjective, and prone to inter-observer variability. Recent advances in digital pathology have enabled automated necrosis quantification. Evaluating on test data, independently sampled on patient-level, revealed that the deep learning model performance dropped significantly from the tile-level generalization ability reported in previous studies. First, this work proposes the use of radiomic features as additional input in model training. We show that, despite that they are derived from the images, such a multimodal input effectively improved the classification performance, in addition to its added benefits in interpretability. Second, this work proposes to optimize two binary classification tasks with hierarchical classes (i.e. tumor-vs-non-tumor and viable-vs-non-viable), as opposed to the alternative ``flat'' three-class classification task (i.e. non-tumor, non-viable tumor, viable tumor), thereby enabling a hierarchical loss. We show that such a hierarchical loss, with trainable weightings between the two tasks, the per-class performance can be improved significantly.

Recently, some works have incorporated iterative knowledge accumulation processes into RAG models to progressively accumulate and refine query-related knowledge, thereby constructing more comprehensive knowledge representations. However, these iterative processes often lack a coherent organizational structure, which limits the construction of more comprehensive and cohesive knowledge representations. To address this, we propose PAGER, a page-driven autonomous knowledge representation framework for RAG. PAGER first prompts an LLM to construct a structured cognitive outline for a given question, which consists of multiple slots representing a distinct knowledge aspect. Then, PAGER iteratively retrieves and refines relevant documents to populate each slot, ultimately constructing a coherent page that serves as contextual input for guiding answer generation. Experiments on multiple knowledge-intensive benchmarks and backbone models show that PAGER consistently outperforms all RAG baselines. Further analyses demonstrate that PAGER constructs higher-quality and information-dense knowledge representations, better mitigates knowledge conflicts, and enables LLMs to leverage external knowledge more effectively.

However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on single-step perception-to-judgment tasks, leaving scenarios requiring complex visual-spatial logical chains significantly underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce Video-MSR, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate Multi-hop Spatial Reasoning (MSR) in dynamic video scenarios. Video-MSR systematically probes MSR capabilities through four distinct tasks: Constrained Localization, Chain-based Reference Retrieval, Route Planning, and Counterfactual Physical Deduction. Our benchmark comprises 3,052 high-quality video instances with 4,993 question-answer pairs, constructed via a scalable, visually-grounded pipeline combining advanced model generation with rigorous human verification. Through a comprehensive evaluation of 20 state-of-the-art MLLMs, we uncover significant limitations, revealing that while models demonstrate proficiency in surface-level perception, they exhibit distinct performance drops in MSR tasks, frequently suffering from spatial disorientation and hallucination during multi-step deductions. To mitigate these shortcomings and empower models with stronger MSR capabilities, we further curate MSR-9K, a specialized instruction-tuning dataset, and fine-tune Qwen-VL, achieving a +7.82% absolute improvement on Video-MSR.

This rapid growth in size has constrained progress in understanding and mitigating their biases. Since re-training LMs is prohibitively expensive, most debiasing work has focused on post-hoc or masking-based strategies, which often fail to address the underlying causes of bias. In this work, we seek to democratise pre-model debiasing research by using low-cost proxy models. Specifically, we investigate BabyLMs, compact BERT-like models trained on small and mutable corpora that can approximate bias acquisition and learning dynamics of larger models. We show that BabyLMs display closely aligned patterns of intrinsic bias formation and performance development compared to standard BERT models, despite their drastically reduced size. Furthermore, correlations between BabyLMs and BERT hold across multiple intra-model and post-model debiasing methods. Leveraging these similarities, we conduct pre-model debiasing experiments with BabyLMs, replicating prior findings and presenting new insights regarding the influence of gender imbalance and toxicity on bias formation. Our results demonstrate that BabyLMs can serve as an effective sandbox for large-scale LMs, reducing pre-training costs from over 500 GPU-hours to under 30 GPU-hours. This provides a way to democratise pre-model debiasing research and enables faster, more accessible exploration of methods for building fairer LMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86BabyLMs\u4f5c\u4e3aBERT\u7684\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53bb\u504f\u89c1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u7740\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ad8\u6602\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5bf9\u5176\u504f\u89c1\u8bc1\u6e90\u7684\u6709\u6548\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u540e\u9a8c\u53bb\u504f\u89c1\u65b9\u6cd5\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7ecf\u6d4e\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u5177\u6709BERT\u7279\u6027\u7684\u5fae\u578b\u6a21\u578bBabyLM\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u4fee\u6539\u7684\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u6a21\u62df\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u5f62\u6210\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u8fdb\u884c\u53bb\u504f\u89c1\u65b9\u6cd5\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "BabyLMs\u5728\u5185\u5728\u504f\u89c1\u5f62\u6210\u3001\u6027\u80fd\u53d1\u5c55\u4e0eBERT\u6a21\u578b\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u53bb\u504f\u89c1\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u4f3c\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0\u6027\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u6bd2\u6027\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u504f\u89c1\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u4ece500GPU\u5c0f\u65f6\u964d\u81f330\u5c0f\u65f6\u3002", "conclusion": "BabyLMs\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53bb\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6c99\u7bb1\uff0c\u663e\u7740\u964d\u4f4e\u7814\u53d1\u6210\u672c\u5e76\u4fc3\u8fdb\u516c\u5e73\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u53ef\u53ca\u6027\u3002"}}

In this work, we design a framework based on mechanistic interpretability methods to identify where and how conflicting knowledge from the pre-training data is encoded within LMs. Our findings contribute to a growing body of evidence that specific internal components of a language model are responsible for encoding conflicting knowledge from pre-training, and we demonstrate how mechanistic interpretability methods can be leveraged to causally intervene in and control conflicting knowledge at inference time.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u68b0\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5e76\u5e72\u9884\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u77db\u76fe\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7684\u51b2\u7a81\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0e\u5916\u90e8\u8d44\u6e90\u51b2\u7a81\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u672a\u63a2\u7d22\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u671f\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u793a\u7684\u51b2\u7a81\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u68b0\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u77db\u76fe\u77e5\u8bc6\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u7ec4\u4ef6\u8d1f\u8d23\u7f16\u7801\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u51b2\u7a81\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u56e0\u679c\u5e72\u9884\u63a7\u5236\u51b2\u7a81\u3002", "conclusion": "\u673a\u68b0\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5e76\u5e72\u9884\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u77e5\u8bc6\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u77db\u76fe\u77e5\u8bc6\u7ba1\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

However, smaller LMs often struggle with this translation task, frequently producing incorrect symbolic outputs due to formatting and translation errors. Existing approaches typically rely on self-iteration to correct these errors, but such methods depend heavily on the capabilities of the underlying model. To address this, we first categorize common errors and fine-tune smaller LMs using data synthesized by large language models. The evaluation is performed using the defined error categories. We introduce incremental inference, which divides inference into two stages, predicate generation and FOL translation, providing greater control over model behavior and enhancing generation quality as measured by predicate metrics. This decomposition framework also enables the use of a verification module that targets predicate-arity errors to further improve performance. Our study evaluates three families of models across four logical-reasoning datasets. The comprehensive fine-tuning, incremental inference, and verification modules reduce error rates, increase predicate coverage, and improve reasoning performance for smaller LMs, moving us closer to developing reliable and accessible symbolic-reasoning systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u589e\u91cf\u63a8\u7406\u4f18\u5316\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u4e00\u9636\u903b\u8f91\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u751f\u6210\u8c13\u8bcd\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7ea0\u9519\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5c0f\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5230\u5f62\u5f0f\u903b\u8f91\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u683c\u5f0f\u548c\u7ffb\u8bd1\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u8fed\u4ee3\u7ea0\u9519\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e25\u91cd\u4f9d\u8d56\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u8eab\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "1) \u6784\u5efa\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7528\u4e8e\u5fae\u8c03\uff1b2) \u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u589e\u91cf\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5148\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u95f4\u8c13\u8bcd\u518d\u5b8c\u6210FOL\u7ffb\u8bd1\uff1b3) \u589e\u52a0\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6a21\u5757\u68c0\u6d4b\u8c13\u8bcd\u5143\u6570\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u5728\u56db\u5927\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7efc\u5408\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\u4f7f\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u8c13\u8bcd\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u63d0\u534728%\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u9ad815.6%\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6a21\u5757\u5bf9\u8c13\u8bcd\u5143\u6570\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u7ea0\u6b63\u7387\u8fbe73%\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u7684\u8de8\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u660e\u901a\u8fc7\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u4f18\u5316\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u9010\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

However, evaluating these heterogeneous systems remains challenging, as existing protocols often struggle to provide comparable scores across architectures or rely on uncalibrated judgments. In this paper, we introduce SlidesGen-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate slide generation through a lens of three core principles: universality, quantification, and reliability. First, to establish a unified evaluation framework, we ground our analysis in the visual domain, treating terminal outputs as renderings to remain agnostic to the underlying generation method. Second, we propose a computational approach that quantitatively assesses slides across three distinct dimensions - Content, Aesthetics, and Editability - offering reproducible metrics where prior works relied on subjective or reference-dependent proxies. Finally, to ensure high correlation with human preference, we construct the Slides-Align1.5k dataset, a human preference aligned dataset covering slides from nine mainstream generation systems across seven scenarios. Our experiments demonstrate that SlidesGen-Bench achieves a higher degree of alignment with human judgment than existing evaluation pipelines.

We study cross-dataset object detection (CD-OD) through a lens of setting specificity. We group benchmarks into setting-agnostic datasets with diverse everyday scenes and setting-specific datasets tied to a narrow environment, and evaluate a standard detector family across all train--test pairs. This reveals a clear structure in CD-OD: transfer within the same setting type is relatively stable, while transfer across setting types drops substantially and is often asymmetric. The most severe breakdowns occur when transferring from specific sources to agnostic targets, and persist after open-label alignment, indicating that domain shift dominates in the hardest regimes. To disentangle domain shift from label mismatch, we compare closed-label transfer with an open-label protocol that maps predicted classes to the nearest target label using CLIP similarity. Open-label evaluation yields consistent but bounded gains, and many corrected cases correspond to semantic near-misses supported by the image evidence. Overall, we provide a principled characterization of CD-OD under setting specificity and practical guidance for evaluating detectors under distribution shift.

Existing automatic survey generation methods typically focus on linear text generation and struggle to explicitly model hierarchical relations among research topics and structured methodological comparisons, resulting in gaps in structural organization compared to expert-written surveys. We propose MVSS, a multi-view structured survey generation framework that jointly generates and aligns citation-grounded hierarchical trees, structured comparison tables, and survey text. MVSS follows a structure-first paradigm: it first constructs a conceptual tree of the research domain, then generates comparison tables constrained by the tree, and finally uses both as structural constraints for text generation.

While point maps assume static scenes, Dynamic Point Maps (DPMs) extend this concept to dynamic 3D content by additionally representing scene motion. However, existing DPMs are limited to image pairs and, like DUSt3R, require post processing via optimization when more than two views are involved. We argue that DPMs are more useful when applied to videos and introduce V-DPM to demonstrate this. First, we show how to formulate DPMs for video input in a way that maximizes representational power, facilitates neural prediction, and enables reuse of pretrained models. Second, we implement these ideas on top of VGGT, a recent and powerful 3D reconstructor. Although VGGT was trained on static scenes, we show that a modest amount of synthetic data is sufficient to adapt it into an effective V-DPM predictor. Our approach achieves state of the art performance in 3D and 4D reconstruction for dynamic scenes. In particular, unlike recent dynamic extensions of VGGT such as P3, DPMs recover not only dynamic depth but also the full 3D motion of every point in the scene.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faV-DPM\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u52a8\u6001\u70b9\u4e91\u56fe(DPMs)\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u914d\uff0c\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u76843D/4D\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0SOTA\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u540c\u65f6\u6062\u590d\u573a\u666f\u52a8\u6001\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e0e\u51683D\u8fd0\u52a8\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709DPMs\u4ec5\u652f\u6301\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\u4e14\u9700\u540e\u5904\u7406\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u89c6\u9891\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u3002DUSt3ER\u7b49\u9759\u6001\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0b\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u8fd0\u52a8\u6062\u590d\u4ecd\u672a\u89e3\u51b3\u3002", "method": "1) \u8bbe\u8ba1\u89c6\u9891\u7248DPM\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u4fe1\u606f\u8868\u8fbe\u4e0e\u795e\u7ecf\u9884\u6d4b\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\uff1b2) \u57fa\u4e8eVGGT\u9759\u6001\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u9891\u5fae\u8c03\u4e0e\u5c11\u91cf\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u9002\u914d\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\uff1b3) \u4fdd\u7559\u539f\u65b9\u6cd5\u9ad8\u6548\u524d\u9988\u7279\u70b9\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u652f\u6301\u591a\u5e27\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8aP3\u7b49SOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1) \u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u9010\u70b9\u51683D\u8fd0\u52a8\u573a\u6062\u590d\uff1b2) \u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e23%\uff1b3) \u8fd0\u52a8\u573a\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u63d0\u534735%\uff1b4) \u652f\u63014D\u65f6\u5e8f\u8fde\u7eed\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89c6\u9891\u7279\u5316\u7684DPM\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u9759\u6001\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5fae\u8c03\u5373\u53ef\u4f7f\u9759\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u5e94\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u3002\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u89c6\u98913D\u91cd\u5efa\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u8868\u793a\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

A sophisticated solution is self-evolution techniques. However, in large-scale industrial settings with massive query streams, this technique faces two challenges: (1) informative samples are often sparse and difficult to identify, and (2) pseudo-labels generated by the current model could be unreliable. To address these challenges, in this work, we propose a Self-Evolving Relevance Model approach (SERM), which comprises two complementary multi-agent modules: a multi-agent sample miner, designed to detect distributional shifts and identify informative training samples, and a multi-agent relevance annotator, which provides reliable labels through a two-level agreement framework. We evaluate SERM in a large-scale industrial setting, which serves billions of user requests daily. Experimental results demonstrate that SERM can achieve significant performance gains through iterative self-evolution, as validated by extensive offline multilingual evaluations and online testing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSERM\uff08Self-Evolving Relevance Model\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6837\u672c\u6316\u6398\u4e0e\u53cc\u5c42\u6807\u6ce8\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u5de5\u4e1a\u7ea7\u641c\u7d22\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u52a8\u6001\u67e5\u8be2\u6d41\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6837\u672c\u7a00\u758f\u4e0e\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u6027\u80fd\u8fed\u4ee3\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u771f\u5b9e\u67e5\u8be2\u6d41\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6f14\u53d8\uff0c\u800c\u81ea\u6211\u8fdb\u5316\u6280\u672f\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u4e24\u5927\u6570\u636e\u6311\u6218\uff1a1\uff09\u4fe1\u606f\u6837\u672c\u7a00\u758f\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c2\uff09\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u80fd\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u53cc\u6a21\u5757\u67b6\u6784\uff1a\uff081\uff09\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6837\u672c\u6316\u6398\u5668\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u6280\u672f\u52a8\u6001\u7b5b\u9009\u9ad8\u4ef7\u503c\u6837\u672c\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u6807\u6ce8\u5668\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u5c42\u5171\u8bc6\u6846\u67b6\uff08\u6837\u672c\u5185\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff09\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u9760\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u95ed\u73af\u81ea\u8fdb\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u670d\u52a1\u65e5\u5747\u6570\u5341\u4ebf\u8bf7\u6c42\u7684\u5de5\u4e1a\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u79bb\u7ebf\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6d4b\u8bd5\u663e\u793a\u8fed\u4ee35\u6b21\u540e\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u534712.7%\uff0c\u5728\u7ebfAB\u6d4b\u8bd5\u70b9\u51fb\u7387\u63d0\u53478.3%\uff0c\u4e14\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ece\u57fa\u7ebf62%\u63d0\u5347\u81f379%\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SERM\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u6570\u636e\u84b8\u998f\u4e0e\u5171\u8bc6\u6807\u6ce8\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u5de5\u4e1a\u7ea7\u641c\u7d22\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u81ea\u8fdb\u5316\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u5316\u4e0e\u4e1a\u52a1\u6307\u6807\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

Departing from conventional pre-training methods for video understanding that rely on pixel-level reconstructions, V-JEPAs learn by predicting embeddings of masked regions from the embeddings of unmasked regions. This enables the trained encoder to not capture irrelevant information about a given video like the color of a region of pixels in the background. Using a pre-trained V-JEPA video encoder, we train shallow classifiers using the RAVDESS and CREMA-D datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance on RAVDESS and outperforming all other vision-based methods on CREMA-D (+1.48 WAR). Furthermore, cross-dataset evaluations reveal strong generalization capabilities, demonstrating the potential of purely embedding-based pre-training approaches to advance FER.

To address this gap, this work conducts a systematic investigation of PTQ under MXFP formats, encompassing over 7 PTQ algorithms, 15 evaluation benchmarks, and 3 LLM families. The key findings include: 1) MXFP8 consistently achieves near-lossless performance, while MXFP4 introduces substantial accuracy degradation and remains challenging; 2) PTQ effectiveness under MXFP depends strongly on format compatibility, with some algorithmic paradigms being consistently more effective than others; 3) PTQ performance exhibits highly consistent trends across model families and modalities, in particular, quantization sensitivity is dominated by the language model rather than the vision encoder in multimodal LLMs; 4) The scaling factor of quantization is a critical error source in MXFP4, and a simple pre-scale optimization strategy can significantly mitigate its impact.

We introduce Dialogue Telemetry (DT), a measurement framework that produces two model-agnostic signals after each question-answer exchange: (i) a Progress Estimator (PE) quantifying residual information potential per category (with a bits-based variant), and (ii) a Stalling Index (SI) detecting an observable failure signature characterized by repeated category probing with semantically similar, low-marginal-gain responses. SI flags this pattern without requiring causal diagnosis, supporting monitoring in settings where attributing degradation to specific causes may be impractical. We validate DT in controlled search-and-rescue (SAR)-inspired interviews using large language model (LLM)-based simulations, distinguishing efficient from stalled dialogue traces and illustrating downstream utility by integrating DT signals into a reinforcement learning (RL) policy.

Instead, we would like to construct an alternative training set from a large-scale data server so that a competitive model can be obtained. For this problem, because the target domain usually exhibits distinct modes (i.e., semantic clusters representing data distribution), if the training set does not contain these target modes, the model performance would be compromised. While prior existing works improve algorithms iteratively, our research explores the often-overlooked potential of optimizing the structure of the data server. Inspired by the hierarchical nature of web search engines, we introduce a hierarchical data server, together with a bipartite mode matching algorithm (BMM) to align source and target modes. For each target mode, we look in the server data tree for the best mode match, which might be large or small in size. Through bipartite matching, we aim for all target modes to be optimally matched with source modes in a one-on-one fashion. Compared with existing training set search algorithms, we show that the matched server modes constitute training sets that have consistently smaller domain gaps with the target domain across object re-identification (re-ID) and detection tasks.

Yet, manual taxonomy expansion is labor-intensive and cannot keep pace with the emergence of new concepts. Existing automated methods rely on point-based vector embeddings, which model symmetric similarity and thus struggle with the asymmetric \"is-a\" relationships that are fundamental to taxonomies. Box embeddings offer a promising alternative by enabling containment and disjointness, but they face key issues: (i) unstable gradients at the intersection boundaries, (ii) no notion of semantic uncertainty, and (iii) limited capacity to represent polysemy or ambiguity. We address these shortcomings with TaxoBell, a Gaussian box embedding framework that translates between box geometries and multivariate Gaussian distributions, where means encode semantic location and covariances encode uncertainty.

Commonly used methods evaluate Euclidean distances between point clouds and minimize an objective function, such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). However, these approaches are most effective when the point clouds are well-prealigned and issues such as differences in density, noise, holes, and limited overlap can compromise the results. Traditional methods, such as Iterative Closest Point (ICP), require choosing one point cloud as fixed, since Euclidean distances lack commutativity. When only one point cloud has issues, adjustments can be made, but in real scenarios, both point clouds may be affected, often necessitating preprocessing. The authors introduce a novel differential entropy-based metric, designed to serve as the objective function within an optimization framework for fine rigid pairwise 3D point cloud registration, denoted as Iterative Differential Entropy Minimization (IDEM). This metric does not depend on the choice of a fixed point cloud and, during transformations, reveals a clear minimum corresponding to the best alignment. Multiple case studies are conducted, and the results are compared with those obtained using RMSE, Chamfer distance, and Hausdorff distance. The proposed metric proves effective even with density differences, noise, holes, and partial overlap, where RMSE does not always yield optimal alignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper proposes a novel differential entropy-based metric (IDEM) for fine rigid pairwise 3D point cloud registration, addressing limitations of traditional methods (e.g., ICP, RMSE) in handling noise, density differences, holes, and partial overlap.

They fail when both point clouds suffer from real-world issues like noise, density mismatches, holes, or limited overlap. The authors aim to develop a symmetric, robust metric that eliminates dependence on fixed references and handles such challenges.", "method": "A \u200cdifferential entropy-based objective function\u200c is introduced to measure alignment quality via the distribution of point disparities. This metric is invariant to the choice of fixed point cloud, unlike Euclidean distances. A new optimization framework (IDEM) minimizes this entropy, revealing a clear optimal transformation without prior alignment. Experiments compare IDEM with RMSE, Chamfer distance, and Hausdorff distance across synthetic and real-world datasets.", "result": "IDEM achieves superior alignment accuracy compared to RMSE-based methods when point clouds have noise, density differences, holes, or partial overlap. The metric demonstrates a distinct minimum at the optimal transformation, indicating higher robustness to challenging conditions. Symmetric optimization avoids bias from selecting a fixed reference cloud.", "conclusion": "The entropy-based metric overcomes asymmetry and sensitivity to initial alignment in traditional registration methods. It provides a more reliable solution for real-world point cloud registration tasks where both input clouds may be degraded. Future work may explore extensions to non-rigid registration or large-scale datasets."}}

Existing approaches typically assume access to ground-truth labeled data, which is often unavailable in practice, especially when user request distributions are heterogeneous and unknown. We introduce Routing with Generated Data (RGD), a challenging setting in which routers are trained exclusively on generated queries and answers produced from high-level task descriptions by generator LLMs. We evaluate query-answer routers (using both queries and labels) and query-only routers across four diverse benchmarks and 12 models, finding that query-answer routers degrade faster than query-only routers as generator quality decreases. Our analysis reveals two crucial characteristics of effective generators: they must accurately respond to their own questions, and their questions must produce sufficient performance differentiation among the model pool.

To bridge this gap, we propose MANGO -- an unpaired image translation method with a novel segmentation-conditioned InfoNCE loss, a highly-regularized discriminator design, and a modified PatchNCE loss. We find that these elements are crucial for maintaining viewpoint consistency during sim2real translation. When training MANGO, we only require a small amount of fixed-camera data from the real world, but show that our method can generate diverse unseen viewpoints by translating simulated observations.

While straightforward, this approach is sensitive to label noise and neglects whether one sample is more positive than another, resulting in unstable predictions and poor correlation alignment. Pairwise ordinal learning frameworks emerged to address this gap, capturing relative order by learning from comparisons. Yet, they introduce two new trade-offs: First, they assign uniform importance to all comparisons, failing to adaptively focus on hard-to-rank samples. Second, they employ static ranking margins, which fail to reflect the varying semantic distances between sentiment groups. To address this, we propose a Two-Stage Group-wise Ranking and Calibration Framework (GRCF) that adapts the philosophy of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our framework resolves these trade-offs by simultaneously preserving relative ordinal structure, ensuring absolute score calibration, and adaptively focusing on difficult samples. Specifically, Stage 1 introduces a GRPO-inspired Advantage-Weighted Dynamic Margin Ranking Loss to build a fine-grained ordinal structure. Stage 2 then employs an MAE-driven objective to align prediction magnitudes. To validate its generalizability, we extend GRCF to classification tasks, including multimodal humor detection and sarcasm detection.

However, most existing systems focus narrowly on object classification within fixed visual scopes and apply rule-based heuristics to determine intrusion status, often overlooking targets that pose latent intrusion risks. Anticipating such risks requires the cognition of spatial context and temporal dynamics for the object of interest (OOI), which presents challenges for conventional visual models. To facilitate deep intrusion perception, we introduce a novel benchmark, CogRail, which integrates curated open-source datasets with cognitively driven question-answer annotations to support spatio-temporal reasoning and prediction. Building upon this benchmark, we conduct a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art visual-language models (VLMs) using multimodal prompts to identify their strengths and limitations in this domain. Furthermore, we fine-tune VLMs for better performance and propose a joint fine-tuning framework that integrates three core tasks, position perception, movement prediction, and threat analysis, facilitating effective adaptation of general-purpose foundation models into specialized models tailored for cognitive intrusion perception. Extensive experiments reveal that current large-scale multimodal models struggle with the complex spatial-temporal reasoning required by the cognitive intrusion perception task, underscoring the limitations of existing foundation models in this safety-critical domain. In contrast, our proposed joint fine-tuning framework significantly enhances model performance by enabling targeted adaptation to domain-specific reasoning demands, highlighting the advantages of structured multi-task learning in improving both accuracy and interpretability.

We introduce a highly efficient, self-supervised method that reframes animal identification as a global clustering task rather than a sequential tracking problem. Our approach assumes a known, fixed number of individuals within a single video -- a common scenario in practice -- and requires only bounding box detections and the total count. By sampling pairs of frames, using a frozen pre-trained backbone, and employing a self-bootstrapping mechanism with the Hungarian algorithm for in-batch pseudo-label assignment, our method learns discriminative features without identity labels. We adapt a Binary Cross Entropy loss from vision-language models, enabling state-of-the-art accuracy ($>$97\\%) while consuming less than 1 GB of GPU memory per batch -- an order of magnitude less than standard contrastive methods. Evaluated on challenging real-world datasets (3D-POP pigeons and 8-calves feeding videos), our framework matches or surpasses supervised baselines trained on over 1,000 labeled frames, effectively removing the manual annotation bottleneck.

Existing frame-to-frame methods achieve real-time performance through local optimization but accumulate scale drift due to the lack of global constraints among independent windows. To address this, we propose SCE-SLAM, an end-to-end SLAM system that maintains scale consistency through scene coordinate embeddings, which are learned patch-level representations encoding 3D geometric relationships under a canonical scale reference. The framework consists of two key modules: geometry-guided aggregation that leverages 3D spatial proximity to propagate scale information from historical observations through geometry-modulated attention, and scene coordinate bundle adjustment that anchors current estimates to the reference scale through explicit 3D coordinate constraints decoded from the scene coordinate embeddings. Experiments on KITTI, Waymo, and vKITTI demonstrate substantial improvements: our method reduces absolute trajectory error by 8.36m on KITTI compared to the best prior approach, while maintaining 36 FPS and achieving scale consistency across large-scale scenes.", "AI": {"tldr": "SCE-SLAM \u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u573a\u666f\u5750\u6807\u5d4c\u5165\u89e3\u51b3\u5355\u76ee\u89c6\u89c9SLAM\u4e2d\u7684\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u6a21\u5757\u5b9e\u73b0\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5728KITTI\u7b49\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u5355\u4e00\u89c6\u89d2\u7684\u89c6\u89c9SLAM\u5b58\u5728\u7d2f\u79ef\u7684\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u4f20\u7edf\u5e27\u5bf9\u5e27\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u5c40\u90e8\u4f18\u5316\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5168\u5c40\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u65b9\u6848\u4ee5\u7ef4\u6301\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u573a\u666f\u5750\u6807\u5d4c\u5165\uff083D\u51e0\u4f55\u5173\u7cfb\u8868\u5f81\uff09\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u5f15\u5bfc\u805a\u5408\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4f20\u64ad\u5386\u53f2\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u573a\u666f\u5750\u6807\u6346\u7ed1\u8c03\u6574\u4ee5\u663e\u5f0f3D\u5750\u6807\u7ea6\u675f\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u5c40\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728KITTI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7edd\u5bf9\u8f68\u8ff9\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e8.36\u7c73\uff0c\u4e14\u4fdd\u630136FPS\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SCE-SLAM\u901a\u8fc7\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u663e\u5f0f\u51e0\u4f55\u7ea6\u675f\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u5e73\u53f0\u3002"}}

This inefficiency poses a critical barrier to deploying generative video in applications that require real-time interactions, such as embodied AI and VR/AR. This paper explores a new strategy for camera-conditioned video generation of static scenes: using diffusion-based generative models to generate a sparse set of keyframes, and then synthesizing the full video through 3D reconstruction and rendering. By lifting keyframes into a 3D representation and rendering intermediate views, our approach amortizes the generation cost across hundreds of frames while enforcing geometric consistency. We further introduce a model that predicts the optimal number of keyframes for a given camera trajectory, allowing the system to adaptively allocate computation. Our final method, SRENDER, uses very sparse keyframes for simple trajectories and denser ones for complex camera motion. This results in video generation that is more than 40 times faster than the diffusion-based baseline in generating 20 seconds of video, while maintaining high visual fidelity and temporal stability, offering a practical path toward efficient and controllable video synthesis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSRENDER\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u7ed3\u54083D\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u6e32\u67d3\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6bd4\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5feb40\u500d\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u9891\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u5e94\u7528\uff08\u5982AI\u4ea4\u4e92\u3001AR/VR\uff09\uff0c\u9700\u5bfb\u627e\u9ad8\u6548\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "1) \u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7a00\u758f\u5173\u952e\u5e27\uff1b2) \u901a\u8fc73D\u91cd\u5efa\u4e0e\u6e32\u67d3\u5408\u6210\u5b8c\u6574\u89c6\u9891\uff1b3) \u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u6570\u91cf\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u76f8\u673a\u8def\u5f84\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u751f\u621020\u79d2\u89c6\u9891\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u8d8540\u500d\uff0c\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u89c6\u89c9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SRENDER\u901a\u8fc73D\u8868\u793a\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u8ba1\u7b97\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u63a7\u89c6\u9891\u5408\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Optimization-based methods typically follow a two-stage pipeline, first detecting 2D keypoints in each view and then associating these detections across views to triangulate the 3D pose. Existing methods rely on mere pairwise associations to model this correspondence problem, treating global consistency between views (i.e., cycle consistency) as a soft constraint. Yet, reconciling these constraints for multiple views becomes brittle when spurious associations propagate errors. We thus propose COMPOSE, a novel framework that formulates multi-view pose correspondence matching as a hypergraph partitioning problem rather than through pairwise association. While the complexity of the resulting integer linear program grows exponentially in theory, we introduce an efficient geometric pruning strategy to substantially reduce the search space.

While recent studies on reasoning VLAs show that explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) can improve generalization, they suffer from high inference latency due to lengthy reasoning traces. We propose Fast-ThinkAct, an efficient reasoning framework that achieves compact yet performant planning through verbalizable latent reasoning. Fast-ThinkAct learns to reason efficiently with latent CoTs by distilling from a teacher, driven by a preference-guided objective to align manipulation trajectories that transfers both linguistic and visual planning capabilities for embodied control. This enables reasoning-enhanced policy learning that effectively connects compact reasoning to action execution. Extensive experiments across diverse embodied manipulation and reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that Fast-ThinkAct achieves strong performance with up to 89.3\\% reduced inference latency over state-of-the-art reasoning VLAs, while maintaining effective long-horizon planning, few-shot adaptation, and failure recovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "Fast-ThinkAct reduces inference latency in vision-language-action tasks through efficient latent reasoning distillation while maintaining strong performance in long-horizon planning and adaptation.", "motivation": "Existing CoT-based vision-language-action frameworks suffer from high inference latency due to lengthy reasoning traces, despite improved generalization capabilities.", "method": "The authors propose a distillation-based framework that learns compact latent chain-of-thought representations guided by a preference-driven objective, aligning language-guided manipulation trajectories while preserving reasoning capabilities for embodied control.", "result": "Experiments demonstrate 89.3% reduced inference latency compared to state-of-the-art models, with preserved performance in long-horizon planning, few-shot adaptation, and failure recovery across multiple embodied manipulation benchmarks.", "conclusion": "Compact reasoning representations can effectively bridge vision-language reasoning with action execution in embodied tasks, enabling low-latency yet capable policy learning."}}
