In a non-robust setting, the ``gold standard'' scoring function, known as the geometric error, follows from a probabilistic model with Gaussian noises. We extend it to spherical noises. In a robust setting, we consider a mixture with uniformly distributed outliers and show that a threshold-based parameterization leads to a unified view of likelihood-based and robust M-estimators and associated local optimization schemes.\n  Next we analyze MAGSAC++ which stands out for two reasons. First, it achieves the best results according to existing benchmarks. Second, it makes quite different modeling assumptions and derivation steps. We discovered, however that the derivation does not correspond to sound principles and the resulting score function is in fact numerically equivalent to a simple Gaussian-uniform likelihood, a basic model within the proposed framework.\n  Finally, we propose an experimental methodology for evaluating scoring functions: assuming either a large validation set, or a small random validation set in expectation. We find that all scoring functions, including using a learned inlier distribution, perform identically. In particular, MAGSAC++ score is found to be neither better performing than simple contenders nor less sensitive to the choice of the threshold hyperparameter.\n  Our theoretical and experimental analysis thus comprehensively revisit the state-of-the-art, which is critical for any future research seeking to improve the methods or apply them to other robust fitting problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u4e86\u51e0\u4f55\u6a21\u578b\u5f97\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86MAGSAC++\u7684\u7b49\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e0d\u540c\u5f97\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u8fd1\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u9c81\u68d2\u51e0\u4f55\u62df\u5408\u4e2d\u5982\u4f55\u6709\u6548\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f73\u65b9\u6cd5MAGSAC++\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u5e76\u5bfb\u6c42\u66f4\u4f18\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u6269\u5c55\u51e0\u4f55\u8bef\u5dee\u81f3\u7403\u5f62\u566a\u58f0\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6df7\u5408\u5747\u5300\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5b9e\u9a8c\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u5f97\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5927/\u5c0f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u96c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u6240\u6709\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u5f97\u5206\u51fd\u6570\uff08\u542b\u5b66\u4e60\u578b\uff09\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u540c\uff0cMAGSAC++\u7684\u5f97\u5206\u7b49\u4ef7\u4e8e\u7b80\u5355\u9ad8\u65af-\u5747\u5300\u4f3c\u7136\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u9608\u503c\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u654f\u611f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u73b0\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6a21\u578b\u5f97\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u9700\u57fa\u4e8e\u66f4\u624e\u5b9e\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u9608\u503c\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

While prior work has investigated how models can be adapted or optimized for specific tasks, far less is known about how well LLMs perform at interpreting authentic educational scenarios without significant customization. As LLM-based systems become widely adopted by learners and educators in everyday academic contexts, understanding their out-of-the-box capabilities is increasingly important for setting expectations and benchmarking. We compared six LLMs to estimate their baseline performance on a simple but important task: classifying instructional moves in authentic classroom transcripts. We evaluated typical prompting methods: zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot prompting. We found that while zero-shot performance was moderate, providing comprehensive examples (few-shot prompting) significantly improved performance for state-of-the-art models, with the strongest configuration reaching Cohen's Kappa = 0.58 against expert-coded annotations. At the same time, improvements were neither uniform nor complete: performance varied considerably by instructional move, and higher recall frequently came at the cost of increased false positives.

Prior work focuses largely on web pages and mobile screens, leaving app widgets underexplored. Unlike web or mobile UIs with rich hierarchical context, widgets are compact, context-free micro-interfaces that summarize key information through dense layouts and iconography under strict spatial constraints. Moreover, while (image, code) pairs are widely available for web or mobile UIs, widget designs are proprietary and lack accessible markup. We formalize this setting as the Widget-to-Code (Widget2Code) and introduce an image-only widget benchmark with fine-grained, multi-dimensional evaluation metrics. Benchmarking shows that although generalized multimodal large language models (MLLMs) outperform specialized UI2Code methods, they still produce unreliable and visually inconsistent code. To address these limitations, we develop a baseline that jointly advances perceptual understanding and structured code generation. At the perceptual level, we follow widget design principles to assemble atomic components into complete layouts, equipped with icon retrieval and reusable visualization modules. At the system level, we design an end-to-end infrastructure, WidgetFactory, which includes a framework-agnostic widget-tailored domain-specific language (WidgetDSL) and a compiler that translates it into multiple front-end implementations (e.g., React, HTML/CSS). An adaptive rendering module further refines spatial dimensions to satisfy compactness constraints. Together, these contributions substantially enhance visual fidelity, establishing a strong baseline and unified infrastructure for future Widget2Code research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Widget2Code\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u3001\u7d27\u51d1\u5e03\u5c40\u7684\u5c0f\u7ec4\u4ef6\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u7ed3\u5408\u611f\u77e5\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7cfb\u7edfWidgetFactory\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709UI\u8f6c\u4ee3\u7801\u6280\u672f\u4e3b\u8981\u805a\u7126\u7f51\u9875/\u624b\u673a\u754c\u9762\uff0c\u4f46\u7d27\u51d1\u578b\u65e0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u5c0f\u7ec4\u4ef6\u56e0\u5bc6\u96c6\u5e03\u5c40\u3001\u56fe\u6807\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u516c\u5f00\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u800c\u9762\u4e34\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u65e0\u6846\u67b6\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u8bed\u8a00WidgetDSL\u53ca\u7f16\u8bd1\u5f15\u64ce\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5305\u542b\u56fe\u6807\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u9002\u914d\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u591a\u7ef4\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u4f46\u4f9d\u7136\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u534727%\uff0c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u6ee1\u8db3\u7387\u63d0\u9ad841%\uff0c\u901a\u8fc793%\u7684\u6e32\u67d3\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u786e\u7acb\u4e86\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5316\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ece\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u591a\u524d\u7aef\u6846\u67b6\uff08React\u7b49\uff09\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u4e3a\u7ec4\u4ef6\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f53\u7cfb\u3002"}}

Because bold language can stem from either strong empirical results or mere rhetorical style, it is often difficult to distinguish between the two. To disentangle rhetorical style from substantive content, we introduce a counterfactual, LLM-based framework: multiple LLM rhetorical personas generate counterfactual writings from the same substantive content, an LLM judge compares them through pairwise evaluations, and the outcomes are aggregated using a Bradley--Terry model. Applying this method to 8,485 ICLR submissions sampled from 2017 to 2025, we generate more than 250,000 counterfactual writings and provide a large-scale quantification of rhetorical style in ML papers. We find that visionary framing significantly predicts downstream attention, including citations and media attention, even after controlling for peer-review evaluations. We also observe a sharp rise in rhetorical strength after 2023, and provide empirical evidence showing that this increase is largely driven by the adoption of LLM-based writing assistance. The reliability of our framework is validated by its robustness to the choice of personas and the high correlation between LLM judgments and human annotations.

This involves aligning both the cortical surface of the brain and the interior volume. Traditional methods treat volumetric and surface-based registration separately, which often leads to inconsistencies that limit downstream analyses. We propose a deep learning framework, NeurAlign, that registers $3$D brain MRI images by jointly aligning both cortical and subcortical regions through a unified volume-and-surface-based representation. Our approach leverages an intermediate spherical coordinate space to bridge anatomical surface topology with volumetric anatomy, enabling consistent and anatomically accurate alignment. By integrating spherical registration into the learning, our method ensures geometric coherence between volume and surface domains. In a series of experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, our method consistently outperforms both classical and machine learning-based registration methods -- improving the Dice score by up to 7 points while maintaining regular deformation fields. Additionally, it is orders of magnitude faster than the standard method for this task, and is simpler to use because it requires no additional inputs beyond an MRI scan.

While their responses often sound fluent and natural, they can also carry subtle tone biases such as sounding overly polite, cheerful, or cautious even when neutrality is expected. These tendencies can influence how users perceive trust, empathy, and fairness in dialogue. In this study, we explore tone bias as a hidden behavioral trait of large language models. The novelty of this research lies in the integration of controllable large language model based dialogue synthesis with tone classification models, enabling robust and ethical emotion recognition in personal assistant interactions. We created two synthetic dialogue datasets, one generated from neutral prompts and another explicitly guided to produce positive or negative tones.

Recently, text classification based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has made significant progress due to their strong capabilities of structural relationship learning. However, these approaches still face two major limitations. First, these approaches fail to fully consider the diverse structural information across word pairs, e.g., co-occurrence, syntax, and semantics. Furthermore, they neglect sequence information in the text graph structure information learning module and can not classify texts with new words and relations. In this paper, we propose a Novel Graph-Sequence Learning Model for Inductive Text Classification (TextGSL) to address the previously mentioned issues. More specifically, we construct a single text-level graph for all words in each text and establish different edge types based on the diverse relationships between word pairs. Building upon this, we design an adaptive multi-edge message-passing paradigm to aggregate diverse structural information between word pairs. Additionally, sequential information among text data can be captured by the proposed TextGSL through the incorporation of Transformer layers. Therefore, TextGSL can learn more discriminative text representations. TextGSL has been comprehensively compared with several strong baselines. The experimental results on diverse benchmarking datasets demonstrate that TextGSL outperforms these baselines in terms of accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper introduces TextGSL, a novel graph-sequence learning model for inductive text classification that addresses limitations in existing GNN-based methods by integrating multi-edge graph structures and Transformer layers to better capture structural and sequential information.", "motivation": "Current GNN-based text classification methods suffer from two key flaws: insufficient utilization of diverse word-pair relationships (co-occurrence, syntax, semantics) and neglect of sequential information, limiting their ability to generalize to unseen words/relations in inductive scenarios.", "method": "TextGSL constructs text-level graphs with multi-edge types representing different word relationships, implements adaptive multi-edge message-passing to aggregate structural information, and incorporates Transformer layers to extract sequential patterns, enabling robust representation learning through combined graph-sequential modeling.", "result": "Experimental results show TextGSL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple benchmark datasets in terms of classification accuracy, particularly demonstrating strong inductive learning capabilities for texts containing novel words and relationships.", "conclusion": "The proposed graph-sequence hybrid architecture effectively combines structural relationship learning with sequential modeling, providing a more comprehensive solution for inductive text classification tasks compared to traditional GNN-only approaches."}}

However, the clinical relevance of the tissue characteristics at the micro- and macro-environment level is limited by the lack of tools that facilitate the measurement of the spatial interaction of individual structure characteristics and their association with clinical parameters. To address these challenges, we introduce HistoWAS (Histology-Wide Association Study), a computational framework designed to link tissue spatial organization to clinical outcomes.

As a proof of concept, we applied HistoWAS to analyze a total of 102 features (72 conventional object-level features and our 30 spatial features) using 385 PAS-stained WSIs from 206 participants in the Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP).

We introduce a general framework for LLM agents to maintain concise contexts through multi-step interaction: Acting through Belief Bottlenecks Expressed in Language (ABBEL), and methods to further improve ABBEL agents with RL post-training. ABBEL replaces long multi-step interaction history by a belief state, i.e., a natural language summary of what has been discovered about task-relevant unknowns. Under ABBEL, at each step the agent first updates a prior belief with the most recent observation from the environment to form a posterior belief, then uses only the posterior to select an action. We systematically evaluate frontier models under ABBEL across six diverse multi-step environments, finding that ABBEL supports generating interpretable beliefs while maintaining near-constant memory use over interaction steps. However, bottleneck approaches are generally prone to error propagation, which we observe causing inferior performance when compared to the full context setting due to errors in belief updating. Therefore, we train LLMs to generate and act on beliefs within the ABBEL framework via reinforcement learning (RL).

To handle complex multi-hop questions that are challenging for single-step retrieval, iterative RAG approaches incorporating reinforcement learning have been proposed. However, existing iterative RAG systems typically plan to decompose questions without leveraging information about the available retrieval corpus, leading to inefficient retrieval and reasoning chains that cascade into suboptimal performance. In this paper, we introduce Early Knowledge Alignment (EKA), a simple but effective module that aligns LLMs with retrieval set before planning in iterative RAG systems with contextually relevant retrieved knowledge. Extensive experiments on six standard RAG datasets demonstrate that by establishing a stronger reasoning foundation, EKA significantly improves retrieval precision, reduces cascading errors, and enhances both performance and efficiency. Our analysis from an entropy perspective demonstrate that incorporating early knowledge reduces unnecessary exploration during the reasoning process, enabling the model to focus more effectively on relevant information subsets. Moreover, EKA proves effective as a versatile, training-free inference strategy that scales seamlessly to large models. Generalization tests across diverse datasets and retrieval corpora confirm the robustness of our approach. Overall, EKA advances the state-of-the-art in iterative RAG systems while illuminating the critical interplay between structured reasoning and efficient exploration in reinforcement learning-augmented frameworks.

Researchers have effectively employed the ``pre-train, prompt, and predict'' paradigm through prompt learning to induce improved few-shot performance. However, prompt learning approaches for PFMs still follow a parametric learning paradigm. As such, the stability of generalization in memorization and rote learning can be compromised. More specifically, conventional prompt learning might face difficulties in fully utilizing atypical instances and avoiding overfitting to shallow patterns with limited data during the process of fully-supervised training. To overcome these constraints, we present our approach, named RetroPrompt, which aims to achieve a balance between memorization and generalization by decoupling knowledge from mere memorization. Unlike traditional prompting methods, RetroPrompt leverages a publicly accessible knowledge base generated from the training data and incorporates a retrieval mechanism throughout the input, training, and inference stages.

However, existing models face critical challenges: temporal resolution mismatch between speech tokens (25Hz) and text tokens (~3Hz) dilutes semantic information, incurs high computational costs, and causes catastrophic forgetting of text LLM knowledge. We introduce Fun-Audio-Chat, a Large Audio Language Model addressing these limitations via two innovations from our previous work DrVoice. First, Dual-Resolution Speech Representations (DRSR): the Shared LLM processes audio at efficient 5Hz (via token grouping), while the Speech Refined Head generates high-quality tokens at 25Hz, balancing efficiency (~50% GPU reduction) and quality. Second, Core-Cocktail Training, a two-stage fine-tuning with intermediate merging that mitigates catastrophic forgetting. We then apply Multi-Task DPO Training to enhance robustness, audio understanding, instruction-following and voice empathy. This multi-stage post-training enables Fun-Audio-Chat to retain text LLM knowledge while gaining powerful audio understanding, reasoning, and generation. Unlike recent LALMs requiring large-scale audio-text pre-training, Fun-Audio-Chat leverages pre-trained models and extensive post-training. Fun-Audio-Chat 8B and MoE 30B-A3B achieve competitive performance on Speech-to-Text and Speech-to-Speech tasks, ranking top among similar-scale models on Spoken QA benchmarks. They also achieve competitive to superior performance on Audio Understanding, Speech Function Calling, Instruction-Following and Voice Empathy.

Notably, while defenses may exist for mature domains such as code review, they are often absent in other common applications such as resume screening and peer review. This paper introduces a benchmark to assess this vulnerability in resume screening, revealing attack success rates exceeding 80% for certain attack types.

Current models can parse simple, single-target commands but fail when presented with complex geospatial scenarios, e.g., segmenting objects at various granularities, executing multi-target instructions, and interpreting implicit user intent. To drive progress against these failures, we present LaSeRS, the first large-scale dataset built for comprehensive training and evaluation across four critical dimensions of language-guided segmentation: hierarchical granularity, target multiplicity, reasoning requirements, and linguistic variability. By capturing these dimensions, LaSeRS moves beyond simple commands, providing a benchmark for complex geospatial reasoning. This addresses a critical gap: existing datasets oversimplify, leading to sensitivity-prone real-world models. We also propose SegEarth-R2, an MLLM architecture designed for comprehensive language-guided segmentation in RS, which directly confronts these challenges. The model's effectiveness stems from two key improvements: (1) a spatial attention supervision mechanism specifically handles the localization of small objects and their components, and (2) a flexible and efficient segmentation query mechanism that handles both single-target and multi-target scenarios.

This study investigates whether incorporating road-facing views alongside driver-facing footage improves distraction detection accuracy in naturalistic driving conditions. Using synchronized dual-camera recordings from real-world driving, we benchmark three leading spatiotemporal action recognition architectures: SlowFast-R50, X3D-M, and SlowOnly-R50. Each model is evaluated under two input configurations: driver-only and stacked dual-view. Results show that while contextual inputs can improve detection in certain models, performance gains depend strongly on the underlying architecture. The single-pathway SlowOnly model achieved a 9.8 percent improvement with dual-view inputs, while the dual-pathway SlowFast model experienced a 7.2 percent drop in accuracy due to representational conflicts. These findings suggest that simply adding visual context is not sufficient and may lead to interference unless the architecture is specifically designed to support multi-view integration.

Instead of requiring users to write their preferences in detailed textual form, our system only asks for a paper-slides example pair and a visual template - natural and easy-to-provide artifacts that implicitly encode rich user preferences across content and visual style. Despite the implicit and unlabeled nature of these inputs, our framework effectively distills and generalizes the preferences to guide customized slide generation. We also introduce a novel chain-of-speech mechanism to align slide content with planned oral narration. Such a design significantly enhances the quality of generated slides and enables downstream applications like video presentations.

Current methods often overlook the rich hierarchical structures, such as the semantic hierarchy of primitives (e.g., apple fruit) and the conceptual hierarchy between primitives and compositions (e.g, sliced apple apple). A few recent efforts have shown effectiveness in modeling these hierarchies through loss regularization within Euclidean space. In this paper, we argue that they fail to scale to the large-scale taxonomies required for real-world CZSL: the space's polynomial volume growth in flat geometry cannot match the exponential structure, impairing generalization capacity. To this end, we propose H2em, a new framework that learns Hierarchical Hyperbolic EMbeddings for CZSL. H2em leverages the unique properties of hyperbolic geometry, a space naturally suited for embedding tree-like structures with low distortion. However, a naive hyperbolic mapping may suffer from hierarchical collapse and poor fine-grained discrimination. We further design two learning objectives to structure this space: a Dual-Hierarchical Entailment Loss that uses hyperbolic entailment cones to enforce the predefined hierarchies, and a Discriminative Alignment Loss with hard negative mining to establish a large geodesic distance between semantically similar compositions. Furthermore, we devise Hyperbolic Cross-Modal Attention to realize instance-aware cross-modal infusion within hyperbolic geometry. Extensive ablations on three benchmarks demonstrate that H2em establishes a new state-of-the-art in both closed-world and open-world scenarios. Our codes will be released.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper proposes H2em, a hyperbolic embedding framework for compositional zero-shot learning that leverages hierarchical structures through specialized losses and hyperbolic geometry to achieve state-of-the-art performance.", "motivation": "Current CZSL methods ignore hierarchical relationships between primitives and compositions, leading to poor generalization in large-scale scenarios due to Euclidean space limitations.", "method": "H2em uses hyperbolic geometry for hierarchical embeddings with (1) Dual-Hierarchical Entailment Loss for hierarchy preservation, (2) Discriminative Alignment Loss for fine-grained separation, and (3) Hyperbolic Cross-Modal Attention for cross-modal integration.", "result": "Achieved state-of-the-art performance on three CZSL benchmarks in both closed-world and open-world settings with improved hierarchical generalization.", "conclusion": "Hyperbolic geometry outperforms Euclidean approaches for hierarchical CZSL, with H2em's specialized losses enhancing hierarchical structure learning and compositional discrimination."}}

This task is particularly challenging for Mandarin, as visemes are highly ambiguous and homophones are prevalent. We propose VALLR-Pin, a novel two-stage framework that extends the recent VALLR architecture from English to Mandarin. First, a shared video encoder feeds into dual decoders, which jointly predict both Chinese character sequences and their standard Pinyin romanization. The multi-task learning of character and phonetic outputs fosters robust visual-semantic representations. During inference, the text decoder generates multiple candidate transcripts. We construct a prompt by concatenating the Pinyin output with these candidate Chinese sequences and feed it to a large language model to resolve ambiguities and refine the transcription. This provides the LLM with explicit phonetic context to correct homophone-induced errors. Finally, we fine-tune the LLM on synthetic noisy examples: we generate imperfect Pinyin-text pairs from intermediate VALLR-Pin checkpoints using the training data, creating instruction-response pairs for error correction. This endows the LLM with awareness of our model's specific error patterns. In summary, VALLR-Pin synergizes visual features with phonetic and linguistic context to improve Mandarin lip-reading performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "VALLR-Pin\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u4e2d\u6587\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u53cc\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u5c55\u82f1\u6587VALLR\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5728\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u540e\u5f15\u5165\u53cc\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u8054\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\u6c49\u5b57\u5e8f\u5217\u548c\u62fc\u97f3\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u6d88\u9664\u6b67\u4e49\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u566a\u58f0\u6570\u636e\u5fae\u8c03\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u4e2d\u6587\u540c\u97f3\u5b57\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e2d\u6587\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\u9762\u4e34\u97f3\u7d20\u9ad8\u5ea6\u6a21\u7cca\u548c\u540c\u97f3\u5b57\u666e\u904d\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff08\u5982\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u540c\u97f3\u8bcd\uff09\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u97f3\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u8bed\u5883\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u5347\u8bc6\u522b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "1.\u5171\u4eab\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8f93\u51fa\u53cc\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u540c\u6b65\u9884\u6d4b\u6c49\u5b57\u5e8f\u5217\u548c\u62fc\u97f3\uff08\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\uff09\uff1b\n2.LLM\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u5c06\u5019\u9009\u6587\u672c\u4e0e\u62fc\u97f3\u62fc\u63a5\u6784\u5efa\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u8fdb\u884c\u7ea0\u9519\uff1b\n3.\u7528\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u95f4\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u7684\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u62fc\u97f3-\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\uff0c\u5408\u6210\u6307\u4ee4-\u54cd\u5e94\u5bf9\u7528\u4e8eLLM\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u4e86\u89e3\u81ea\u7814\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u9519\u8bef\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u3001\u62fc\u97f3\u97f3\u7d20\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e09\u8054\u534f\u540c\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e2d\u6587\u540c\u97f3\u5b57\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u97f3\u6b67\u4e49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u58f0\u5507\u8bfb\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u53d1\u97f3\u76f8\u8fd1\u4f46\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6c49\u5b57\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u4e2d\u6587\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u89c6\u89c9-\u5b57\u7b26-\u62fc\u97f3\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u5fae\u8c03\u7684LLM\u540e\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u89e3\u51b3\u97f3\u7d20\u6a21\u7cca\u4e0e\u540c\u97f3\u5e72\u6270\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u5883\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8303\u4f8b\u3002"}}

This requires extracting semantic representations directly from speech. Our contributions are threefold. First, we introduce SpidR, a self-supervised speech representation model that efficiently learns representations with highly accessible phonetic information, which makes it particularly suited for textless spoken language modeling. It is trained on raw waveforms using a masked prediction objective combined with self-distillation and online clustering. The intermediate layers of the student model learn to predict assignments derived from the teacher's intermediate layers. This learning objective stabilizes the online clustering procedure compared to previous approaches, resulting in higher quality codebooks. SpidR outperforms wav2vec 2.0, HuBERT, WavLM, and DinoSR on downstream language modeling benchmarks (sWUGGY, sBLIMP, tSC). Second, we systematically evaluate across models and layers the correlation between speech unit quality (ABX, PNMI) and language modeling performance, validating these metrics as reliable proxies. Finally, SpidR significantly reduces pretraining time compared to HuBERT, requiring only one day of pretraining on 16 GPUs, instead of a week. This speedup is enabled by the pretraining method and an efficient codebase, which allows faster iteration and easier experimentation.

We address this gap for Bangla by introducing BanglaRiddleEval, a benchmark of 1,244 traditional Bangla riddles instantiated across four tasks (4,976 riddle-task artifacts in total). Using an LLM-based pipeline, we generate Chain-of-Thought explanations, semantically coherent distractors, and fine-grained ambiguity annotations, and evaluate a diverse suite of open-source and closed-source models under different prompting strategies. Models achieve moderate semantic overlap on generative QA but low correctness, MCQ accuracy peaks at only about 56% versus an 83% human baseline, and ambiguity resolution ranges from roughly 26% to 68%, with high-quality explanations confined to the strongest models. These results show that current LLMs capture some cues needed for Bangla riddle reasoning but remain far from human-level performance, establishing BanglaRiddleEval as a challenging new benchmark for low-resource figurative reasoning.

However, progressive image compression with fine granular scalability (FGS)-which enables decoding a single bitstream at multiple quality levels-remains unexplored for machine-oriented codecs. In this work, we propose a novel progressive learned image compression codec for machine perception, PICM-Net, based on trit-plane coding. By analyzing the difference between human- and machine-oriented rate-distortion priorities, we systematically examine the latent prioritization strategies in terms of machine-oriented codecs. To further enhance real-world adaptability, we design an adaptive decoding controller, which dynamically determines the necessary decoding level during inference time to maintain the desired confidence of downstream machine prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach enables efficient and adaptive progressive transmission while maintaining high performance in the downstream classification task, establishing a new paradigm for machine-aware progressive image compression.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86PICM-Net\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411\u673a\u5668\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u56fe\u50cf\u538b\u7f29\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u503c\u5e73\u9762\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u89e3\u7801\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f20\u8f93\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u56fe\u50cf\u538b\u7f29\u6280\u672f\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c6\u89c9\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u800c\u9762\u5411\u673a\u5668\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u538b\u7f29\uff08FGS\uff09\u7814\u7a76\u5c1a\u5c5e\u7a7a\u767d\u3002\u673a\u5668\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c6\u89c9\u5b58\u5728\u7387\u5931\u771f\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u6ee1\u8db3\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e09\u503c\u5e73\u9762\u7f16\u7801\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1PICM-Net\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u4eba\u673a\u611f\u77e5\u5dee\u5f02\u63d0\u51fa\u6f5c\u53d8\u91cf\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u521b\u65b0\u6027\u8bbe\u8ba1\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u89e3\u7801\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u6839\u636e\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u89e3\u7801\u5c42\u7ea7\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5355\u4e00\u6d41\u89e3\u7801\u591a\u8d28\u91cf\u5c42\u7ea7\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u89e3\u7801\u7b56\u7565\u51cf\u5c11\u5197\u4f59\u4f20\u8f93\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u4f20\u8f93\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u5f00\u521b\u6027\u5730\u5c06\u9010\u5c42\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u538b\u7f29\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u673a\u5668\u89c6\u89c9\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4e09\u503c\u5e73\u9762\u7f16\u7801\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u89e3\u7801\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u611f\u77e5\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u538b\u7f29\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

To address the limitation, we propose LiDARDraft, which utilizes the 3D layout to build a bridge between versatile conditional signals and LiDAR point clouds. The 3D layout can be trivially generated from various user inputs such as textual descriptions and images. Specifically, we represent text, images, and point clouds as unified 3D layouts, which are further transformed into semantic and depth control signals. Then, we employ a rangemap-based ControlNet to guide LiDAR point cloud generation.

Self-Awareness via Internal Circuits", "comment": null, "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) generate fluent and complex outputs but often fail to recognize their own mistakes and hallucinations. Existing approaches typically rely on external judges, multi-sample consistency, or text-based self-critique, which incur additional compute or correlate weakly with true correctness. We ask: can LLMs predict their own failures by inspecting internal states during inference? We introduce Gnosis, a lightweight self-awareness mechanism that enables frozen LLMs to perform intrinsic self-verification by decoding signals from hidden states and attention patterns. Gnosis passively observes internal traces, compresses them into fixed-budget descriptors, and predicts correctness with negligible inference cost, adding only ~5M parameters and operating independently of sequence length. Across math reasoning, open-domain question answering, and academic knowledge benchmarks, and over frozen backbones ranging from 1.7B to 20B parameters, Gnosis consistently outperforms strong internal baselines and large external judges in both accuracy and calibration.

The benchmark decomposes performance into five skills: (i) reconstructing cube faces from images and text, (ii) choosing the optimal next move, (iii) predicting the outcome of a candidate move without applying it, (iv) executing multi-step plans while recovering from mistakes, and (v) detecting and revising one's own errors. Using a shared set of scrambled cube states, identical prompts and parsers, and a single distance-to-solved metric, we compare recent MLLMs side by side as a function of scramble depth. Across seven MLLMs, accuracy drops sharply with depth; once a trajectory stalls or diverges, models rarely recover, and high face-reconstruction accuracy does not guarantee competent action selection or multi-step execution. A pronounced closed- vs open-source gap emerges: the strongest closed model leads on both single-step perception tasks and multi-step control tasks, while open-weight models cluster near chance on the hardest settings; yet even the best MLLM degrades at higher cube complexity. A simple self-correction via reflective thinking yields modest gains but can also introduce overthinking.

However, existing methods often suffer from multi-source entanglement and audio-visual misalignment, which lead to biases toward louder or larger objects while overlooking weaker, smaller, or co-occurring sources. To address these challenges, we propose DDAVS, a Disentangled Audio Semantics and Delayed Bidirectional Alignment framework. To mitigate multi-source entanglement, DDAVS employs learnable queries to extract audio semantics and anchor them within a structured semantic space derived from an audio prototype memory bank. This is further optimized through contrastive learning to enhance discriminability and robustness. To alleviate audio-visual misalignment, DDAVS introduces dual cross-attention with delayed modality interaction, improving the robustness of multimodal alignment. Extensive experiments on the AVS-Objects and VPO benchmarks demonstrate that DDAVS consistently outperforms existing approaches, exhibiting strong performance across single-source, multi-source, and multi-instance scenarios. These results validate the effectiveness and generalization ability of our framework under challenging real-world audio-visual segmentation conditions.

Existing pruning approaches treat either tokens or heads in isolation, relying on heuristics or first-order signals, which often sacrifice accuracy or fail to generalize across inputs. We introduce HEART-ViT, a Hessian-guided efficient dynamic attention and token pruning framework for vision transformers, which to the best of our knowledge is the first unified, second-order, input-adaptive framework for ViT optimization. HEART-ViT estimates curvature-weighted sensitivities of both tokens and attention heads using efficient Hessian-vector products, enabling principled pruning decisions under explicit loss budgets.This dual-view sensitivity reveals an important structural insight: token pruning dominates computational savings, while head pruning provides fine-grained redundancy removal, and their combination achieves a superior trade-off. On ImageNet-100 and ImageNet-1K with ViT-B/16 and DeiT-B/16, HEART-ViT achieves up to 49.4 percent FLOPs reduction, 36 percent lower latency, and 46 percent higher throughput, while consistently matching or even surpassing baseline accuracy after fine-tuning, for example 4.7 percent recovery at 40 percent token pruning. Beyond theoretical benchmarks, we deploy HEART-ViT on different edge devices such as AGX Orin, demonstrating that our reductions in FLOPs and latency translate directly into real-world gains in inference speed and energy efficiency.

Existing DIR methods are primarily based on image queries that retrieve documents within the same coarse semantic category, e.g., newspapers or receipts. However, these methods struggle to effectively retrieve document images in real-world scenarios where textual queries with fine-grained semantics are usually provided. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new Natural Language-based Document Image Retrieval (NL-DIR) benchmark with corresponding evaluation metrics. In this work, natural language descriptions serve as semantically rich queries for the DIR task. The NL-DIR dataset contains 41K authentic document images, each paired with five high-quality, fine-grained semantic queries generated and evaluated through large language models in conjunction with manual verification. We perform zero-shot and fine-tuning evaluations of existing mainstream contrastive vision-language models and OCR-free visual document understanding (VDU) models. A two-stage retrieval method is further investigated for performance improvement while achieving both time and space efficiency.

However, the radar signals are often sparse due to specular reflection, making the extraction of robust features from radar signals highly challenging. To address this, we present milliMamba, a radar-based 2D human pose estimation framework that jointly models spatio-temporal dependencies across both the feature extraction and decoding stages. Specifically, given the high dimensionality of radar inputs, we adopt a Cross-View Fusion Mamba encoder to efficiently extract spatio-temporal features from longer sequences with linear complexity. A Spatio-Temporal-Cross Attention decoder then predicts joint coordinates across multiple frames. Together, this spatio-temporal modeling pipeline enables the model to leverage contextual cues from neighboring frames and joints to infer missing joints caused by specular reflections. To reinforce motion smoothness, we incorporate a velocity loss alongside the standard keypoint loss during training. Experiments on the TransHuPR and HuPR datasets demonstrate that our method achieves significant performance improvements, exceeding the baselines by 11.0 AP and 14.6 AP, respectively, while maintaining reasonable complexity.

One of the challenges is apple pose estimation, where key points, such as the calyx, are often occluded. Recently developed pose estimation methods no longer rely on these key points, but still require them for annotations, making annotating challenging and time-consuming. Due to the abovementioned occlusions, there can be conflicting and missing annotations of the same fruit between different images. Novel 3D reconstruction methods can be used to simplify annotating and enlarge datasets. We propose a novel pipeline consisting of 3D Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct an orchard scene, simplified annotations, automated projection of the annotations to images, and the training and evaluation of a pose estimation method. Using our pipeline, 105 manual annotations were required to obtain 28,191 training labels, a reduction of 99.6%. Experimental results indicated that training with labels of fruits that are $\\leq95\\%$ occluded resulted in the best performance, with a neutral F1 score of 0.927 on the original images and 0.970 on the rendered images. Adjusting the size of the training dataset had small effects on the model performance in terms of F1 score and pose estimation accuracy. It was found that the least occluded fruits had the best position estimation, which worsened as the fruits became more occluded. It was also found that the tested pose estimation method was unable to correctly learn the orientation estimation of apples.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e3D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u65b0\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u679c\u56ed\u4e2d\u82f9\u679c\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\uff08\u51cf\u5c1199.6%\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5bf9\u9ad8\u5ea6\u906e\u6321\u6c34\u679c\u7684\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u4f46\u65b9\u5411\u4f30\u8ba1\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9\u679c\u56ed\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u906e\u6321\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6613\u88ab\u906e\u6321\u7684\u5173\u952e\u70b9\uff08\u5982\u679c\u843c\uff09\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6807\u6ce8\u56f0\u96be\u4e14\u8017\u65f6\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u65e0\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u952e\u70b9\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u4e14\u906e\u6321\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u6807\u6ce8\u51b2\u7a81\u6216\u7f3a\u5931\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u5f00\u53d1\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u4f4e\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5305\u542b\u4ee5\u4e0b\u6b65\u9aa4\u76843D\u91cd\u5efa\u4e0e\u6807\u6ce8\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1a1) \u4f7f\u75283D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u6280\u672f\u91cd\u5efa\u679c\u56ed\u573a\u666f\uff1b2) \u7b80\u5316\u6807\u6ce8\u6d41\u7a0b\uff08\u4ec5\u6807\u6ce8\u8fb9\u754c\u6846\u548c\u7c7b\u522b\uff09\uff1b3) \u81ea\u52a8\u5c06\u6807\u6ce8\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u8bad\u7ec3\u6807\u7b7e\uff1b4) \u8bad\u7ec3\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6b64\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06105\u6b21\u624b\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u6269\u5c55\u4e3a28,191\u4e2a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6807\u7b7e\u3002", "result": "1) \u4f7f\u7528\u226495%\u906e\u6321\u7684\u679c\u6807\u7b7e\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u6700\u4f73\uff1a\u539f\u56feF1\u5f97\u5206\u4e3a0.927\uff0c\u6e32\u67d3\u56feF1\u5f97\u5206\u4e3a0.970\uff1b2) \u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u8f83\u5c0f\uff1b3) \u672a\u906e\u6321\u679c\u5b9e\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4f30\u8ba1\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u906e\u6321\u7a0b\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b4) \u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u5b66\u4e60\u82f9\u679c\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u906e\u6321\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u5411\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e863D\u91cd\u5efa\u4e0e\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u6548\u7528\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6307\u51fa\u5f53\u524d\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u65b9\u5411\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0a\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

In this paper, we systematically study multi-teacher distillation for vision foundation models and identify key factors that enable training at lower computational cost. We introduce Agglomerative Mixture-of-Experts Vision Foundation Models (AMoE), which distill knowledge from SigLIP2 and DINOv3 simultaneously into a Mixture-of-Experts student.

To address this challenge, we propose a Degradation-Aware Metric Prompting (DAMP) framework.

Despite recent progress, existing WSCOD methods still lag far behind fully supervised ones due to two major limitations: (1) the pseudo masks generated by general-purpose segmentation models (e.g., SAM) and filtered via rules are often unreliable, as these models lack the task-specific semantic understanding required for effective pseudo labeling in COD; and (2) the neglect of inherent annotation bias in scribbles, which hinders the model from capturing the global structure of camouflaged objects. To overcome these challenges, we propose ${D}^{3}$ETOR, a two-stage WSCOD framework consisting of Debate-Enhanced Pseudo Labeling and Frequency-Aware Progressive Debiasing. In the first stage, we introduce an adaptive entropy-driven point sampling method and a multi-agent debate mechanism to enhance the capability of SAM for COD, improving the interpretability and precision of pseudo masks. In the second stage, we design FADeNet, which progressively fuses multi-level frequency-aware features to balance global semantic understanding with local detail modeling, while dynamically reweighting supervision strength across regions to alleviate scribble bias.

They also incur high computational costs due to additional interaction modules introduced into DiTs, while the limited scale and quality of existing public datasets also restrict model generalization and effective training. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, KeyTailor, along with a large-scale, high-definition dataset, ViT-HD. The core idea of KeyTailor is a keyframe-driven details injection strategy, motivated by the fact that keyframes inherently contain both foreground dynamics and background consistency. Specifically, KeyTailor adopts an instruction-guided keyframe sampling strategy to filter informative frames from the input video. Subsequently,two tailored keyframe-driven modules, the garment details enhancement module and the collaborative background optimization module, are employed to distill garment dynamics into garment-related latents and to optimize the integrity of background latents, both guided by keyframes.These enriched details are then injected into standard DiT blocks together with pose, mask, and noise latents, enabling efficient and realistic try-on video synthesis. This design ensures consistency without explicitly modifying the DiT architecture, while simultaneously avoiding additional complexity. In addition, our dataset ViT-HD comprises 15, 070 high-quality video samples at a resolution of 810*1080, covering diverse garments.

Inspired by 3D Gaussian Splatting, recent 2D Gaussian image models improve representation efficiency, yet existing methods struggle to balance compression ratio and reconstruction fidelity in ultra-high-resolution scenarios. To address this issue, we propose SmartSplat, a highly adaptive and feature-aware GS-based image compression framework that supports arbitrary image resolutions and compression ratios. SmartSplat leverages image-aware features such as gradients and color variances, introducing a Gradient-Color Guided Variational Sampling strategy together with an Exclusion-based Uniform Sampling scheme to improve the non-overlapping coverage of Gaussian primitives in pixel space. In addition, we propose a Scale-Adaptive Gaussian Color Sampling method to enhance color initialization across scales. Through joint optimization of spatial layout, scale, and color initialization, SmartSplat efficiently captures both local structures and global textures using a limited number of Gaussians, achieving high reconstruction quality under strong compression. Extensive experiments on DIV8K and a newly constructed 16K dataset demonstrate that SmartSplat consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods at comparable compression ratios and exceeds their compression limits, showing strong scalability and practical applicability.

We explore exocentric video with ambient sensors as a non-intrusive, scalable alternative. While prior egocentric-wearable works predominantly adopt Global Alignment by encoding entire sequences into unified representations, this approach fails in exocentric-ambient settings due to two problems: (P1) inability to capture local details such as subtle motions, and (P2) over-reliance on modality-invariant temporal patterns, causing misalignment between actions sharing similar temporal patterns with different spatio-semantic contexts. To resolve these problems, we propose DETACH, a decomposed spatio-temporal framework. This explicit decomposition preserves local details, while our novel sensor-spatial features discovered via online clustering provide semantic grounding for context-aware alignment. To align the decomposed features, our two-stage approach establishes spatial correspondence through mutual supervision, then performs temporal alignment via a spatial-temporal weighted contrastive loss that adaptively handles easy negatives, hard negatives, and false negatives.

TBSD method consists of two principal processes: the first process learns the texture basis functions to effectively extract quasi-periodic texture patterns; the subsequent anomaly detection process utilizes that texture basis as prior knowledge to prevent texture misidentification and capture potential anomalies with high accuracy.The proposed method surpasses benchmarks with less misidentification, smaller training dataset requirement, and superior anomaly detection performance on both simulation and real-world datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7eb9\u7406\u57fa\u96c6\u6210\u5149\u6ed1\u5206\u89e3\uff08TBSD\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u5177\u6709\u5e73\u6ed1\u80cc\u666f\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u5f02\u5e38\u7684\u7eb9\u7406\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u5b66\u5efa\u6a21\u7eb9\u7406\u7684\u51c6\u5468\u671f\u6027\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bef\u68c0\u7387\u9ad8\u3001\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u7eb9\u7406\u7f3a\u9677\u56fe\u50cf\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u8bef\u68c0\u7387\u9ad8\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4f4e\u3001\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u68c0\u6d4b\u6280\u672f\u3002", "method": "TBSD\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1a1) \u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u7eb9\u7406\u57fa\u51fd\u6570\u63d0\u53d6\u51c6\u5468\u671f\u6027\u7eb9\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b2) \u5229\u7528\u7eb9\u7406\u57fa\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fdb\u884c\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u7eb9\u7406\u8bef\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u7eb9\u7406\u51c6\u5468\u671f\u6027\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u7406\u8bba\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8bef\u68c0\u7387\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42\u548c\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u5de5\u4e1a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "conclusion": "TBSD\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u7eb9\u7406\u57fa\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u51c6\u5468\u671f\u6027\u6570\u5b66\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u7eb9\u7406\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5236\u9020\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, most existing methods overlook physical cues such as joint actuation forces that are fundamental in biomechanics. This gap motivates our study: if and when do physically inferred forces enhance motion understanding? By incorporating forces into established motion understanding pipelines, we systematically evaluate their impact across baseline models on 3 major tasks: gait recognition, action recognition, and fine-grained video captioning. Across 8 benchmarks, incorporating forces yields consistent performance gains; for example, on CASIA-B, Rank-1 gait recognition accuracy improved from 89.52% to 90.39% (+0.87), with larger gain observed under challenging conditions: +2.7% when wearing a coat and +3.0% at the side view. On Gait3D, performance also increases from 46.0% to 47.3% (+1.3). In action recognition, CTR-GCN achieved +2.00% on Penn Action, while high-exertion classes like punching/slapping improved by +6.96%. Even in video captioning, Qwen2.5-VL's ROUGE-L score rose from 0.310 to 0.339 (+0.029), indicating that physics-inferred forces enhance temporal grounding and semantic richness.

While diffusion-based text-to-image models have demonstrated strong capabilities in visual content generation, their text rendering performance, particularly for small-scale typography and non-Latin scripts, remains limited. In this paper, we propose UTDesign, a unified framework for high-precision stylized text editing and conditional text generation in design images, supporting both English and Chinese scripts. Our framework introduces a novel DiT-based text style transfer model trained from scratch on a synthetic dataset, capable of generating transparent RGBA text foregrounds that preserve the style of reference glyphs. We further extend this model into a conditional text generation framework by training a multi-modal condition encoder on a curated dataset with detailed text annotations, enabling accurate, style-consistent text synthesis conditioned on background images, prompts, and layout specifications. Finally, we integrate our approach into a fully automated text-to-design (T2D) pipeline by incorporating pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) models and an MLLM-based layout planner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UTDesign achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source methods in terms of stylistic consistency and text accuracy, and also exhibits unique advantages compared to proprietary commercial approaches.

This research evaluates adaptive Red-Green-Blue (RGB) and Long-Wave Infrared (LWIR) fusion for Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS)-based detection of surface-laid landmines, leveraging the thermal contrast between the ordnance and the surrounding soil to enhance feature extraction. Using You Only Look Once (YOLO) architectures (v8, v10, v11) across 114 test images, generating 35,640 model-condition evaluations, YOLOv11 achieved optimal performance (86.8% mAP), with 10 to 30% thermal fusion at 5 to 10m altitude identified as the optimal detection parameters. A complementary architectural comparison revealed that while RF-DETR achieved the highest accuracy (69.2% mAP), followed by Faster R-CNN (67.6%), YOLOv11 (64.2%), and RetinaNet (50.2%), YOLOv11 trained 17.7 times faster than the transformer-based RF-DETR (41 minutes versus 12 hours), presenting a critical accuracy-efficiency tradeoff for operational deployment. Aggregated multi-temporal training datasets outperformed season-specific approaches by 1.8 to 9.6%, suggesting that models benefit from exposure to diverse thermal conditions. Anti-Tank (AT) mines achieved 61.9% detection accuracy, compared with 19.2% for Anti-Personnel (AP) mines, reflecting both the size differential and thermal-mass differences between these ordnance classes.

Multi-view pose estimation methods have the potential to solve these issues, but existing works rely on precise single-view pose estimates or lack generalization to unseen objects. We address these challenges via the following three contributions. First, we introduce AlignPose, a 6D object pose estimation method that aggregates information from multiple extrinsically calibrated RGB views and does not require any object-specific training or symmetry annotation. Second, the key component of this approach is a new multi-view feature-metric refinement specifically designed for object pose. It optimizes a single, consistent world-frame object pose minimizing the feature discrepancy between on-the-fly rendered object features and observed image features across all views simultaneously.

A core challenge lies in effectively handling disparities in dynamic range and focus depth between the inputs. With the advent of vision-language models, recent methods incorporate textual descriptions as auxiliary guidance to enhance fusion quality. However, simply incorporating coarse-grained descriptions hampers the understanding of fine-grained details and poses challenges for precise cross-modal alignment. To address these limitations, we propose Multi-grained Text-guided Image Fusion (MTIF), a novel fusion paradigm with three key designs. First, it introduces multi-grained textual descriptions that separately capture fine details, structural cues, and semantic content, guiding image fusion through a hierarchical cross-modal modulation module.

Existing token reduction methods often ignore the textual query or rely on deep attention maps, whose instability under aggressive pruning leads to degraded semantic alignment.\n  We propose FlashVLM, a text guided visual token selection framework that dynamically adapts visual inputs to the query. Instead of relying on noisy attention weights, FlashVLM computes an explicit cross modal similarity between projected image tokens and normalized text embeddings in the language model space. This extrinsic relevance is fused with intrinsic visual saliency using log domain weighting and temperature controlled sharpening. In addition, a diversity preserving partition retains a minimal yet representative set of background tokens to maintain global context.\n  Under identical token budgets and evaluation protocols, FlashVLM achieves beyond lossless compression, slightly surpassing the unpruned baseline while pruning up to 77.8 percent of visual tokens on LLaVA 1.5, and maintaining 92.8 percent accuracy even under 94.4 percent compression.

Motivated by this gap, we empirically study how misalignment between privileged expert demonstrations and sensor-based student observations can limit the effectiveness of imitation learning. More precisely, experts have significantly higher visibility (e.g., ignoring occlusions) and far lower uncertainty (e.g., knowing other vehicles' actions), making them difficult to imitate reliably. Furthermore, navigational intent (i.e., the route to follow) is under-specified in student models at test time via only a single target point. We demonstrate that these asymmetries can measurably limit driving performance in CARLA and offer practical interventions to address them. After careful modifications to narrow the gaps between expert and student, our TransFuser v6 (TFv6) student policy achieves a new state of the art on all major publicly available CARLA closed-loop benchmarks, reaching 95 DS on Bench2Drive and more than doubling prior performances on Longest6~v2 and Town13. Additionally, by integrating perception supervision from our dataset into a shared sim-to-real pipeline, we show consistent gains on the NAVSIM and Waymo Vision-Based End-to-End driving benchmarks.

Existing methods commonly rely on shallow convolutional backbones such as ResNet that process frames independently, lacking temporal coherence and producing unreliable matching costs under challenging conditions. Through systematic analysis, we find that video Diffusion Transformers (DiTs), pre-trained on large-scale real-world videos with spatio-temporal attention, inherently exhibit strong point tracking capability and robustly handle dynamic motions and frequent occlusions.

Inspired by FedPIDAvg, we define a round-wise task for FedPOD to enhance training efficiency. FedPIDAvg achieved performance improvement by incorporating the training loss reduction for prediction entropy as weights using differential terms. Furthermore, by modeling data distribution with a Poisson distribution and using a PID controller, it reduced communication costs even in skewed data distribution. However, excluding participants classified as outliers based on the Poisson distribution can limit data utilization. Additionally, PID controller requires the same participants to be maintained throughout the federated learning process as it uses previous rounds' learning information in the current round. In our approach, FedPOD addresses these issues by including participants excluded as outliers, eliminating dependency on previous rounds' learning information, and applying a method for calculating validation loss at each round. In this challenge, FedPOD presents comparable performance to FedPIDAvg in metrics of Dice score, 0.78, 0.71 and 0.72 for WT, ET and TC in average, and projected convergence score, 0.74 in average. Furthermore, the concept of FedPOD draws inspiration from Kubernetes' smallest computing unit, POD, designed to be compatible with Kubernetes auto-scaling. Extending round-wise tasks of FedPOD to POD units allows flexible design by applying scale-out similar to Kubernetes' auto-scaling.

Yet in multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), this hierarchy remains poorly understood, as most studies focus on a narrow set of tasks. We introduce SpatialTree, a cognitive-science-inspired hierarchy that organizes spatial abilities into four levels: low-level perception (L1), mental mapping (L2), simulation (L3), and agentic competence (L4). Based on this taxonomy, we construct the first capability-centric hierarchical benchmark, thoroughly evaluating mainstream MLLMs across 27 sub-abilities. The evaluation results reveal a clear structure: L1 skills are largely orthogonal, whereas higher-level skills are strongly correlated, indicating increasing interdependency. Through targeted supervised fine-tuning, we uncover a surprising transfer dynamic-negative transfer within L1, but strong cross-level transfer from low- to high-level abilities with notable synergy. Finally, we explore how to improve the entire hierarchy. We find that naive RL that encourages extensive \"thinking\" is unreliable: it helps complex reasoning but hurts intuitive perception. We propose a simple auto-think strategy that suppresses unnecessary deliberation, enabling RL to consistently improve performance across all levels.

While this approach can generate high-quality videos, it suffers from slow convergence and is computationally expensive when generating long videos. In this paper, we introduce SemanticGen, a novel solution to address these limitations by generating videos in the semantic space. Our main insight is that, due to the inherent redundancy in videos, the generation process should begin in a compact, high-level semantic space for global planning, followed by the addition of high-frequency details, rather than directly modeling a vast set of low-level video tokens using bi-directional attention. SemanticGen adopts a two-stage generation process. In the first stage, a diffusion model generates compact semantic video features, which define the global layout of the video. In the second stage, another diffusion model generates VAE latents conditioned on these semantic features to produce the final output. We observe that generation in the semantic space leads to faster convergence compared to the VAE latent space. Our method is also effective and computationally efficient when extended to long video generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SemanticGen produces high-quality videos and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and strong baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "SemanticGen\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u5168\u7403\u5e03\u5c40\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u518d\u7ed3\u5408VAE\u751f\u6210\u7ec6\u8282\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u514b\u670d\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u751f\u6210\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u65f6\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6548\u679c\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u5728VAE\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u89c6\u9891\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u6162\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u89c6\u9891\u672c\u8eab\u5305\u542b\u5927\u91cf\u5197\u4f59\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5efa\u6a21\u4f4e\u7ea7\u89c6\u9891\u6807\u8bb0\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7cbe\u7b80\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u89c6\u9891\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u5b9a\u4e49\u89c6\u9891\u5168\u5c40\u5e03\u5c40\uff09\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528\u53e6\u4e00\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u751f\u6210VAE\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u4ee5\u8f93\u51fa\u6700\u7ec8\u89c6\u9891\u3002", "result": "\u8bed\u4e49\u7a7a\u95f4\u751f\u6210\u76f8\u6bd4VAE\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u751f\u6210\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u65e2\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u53c8\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "SemanticGen\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ca\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5148\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u7ef4\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u518d\u8865\u5145\u7ec6\u8282\u7684\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}
