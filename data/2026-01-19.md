*Gerhard Krumpl,Henning Avenhaus,Horst Possegger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出ICONIC-444工业图像数据集，包含310万张多尺度图像，用于提升OOD检测研究的基准测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集缺乏定义清晰的OOD类别和复杂任务场景，阻碍了OOD检测方法的验证与发展。

Method: 通过工业分拣原型机采集真实工业场景数据，设计444类精细标注体系并构建4种难度渐变评估任务。

Result: 提供22种SOTA方法的基准性能表现，证实数据集在细粒度/粗粒度任务中的有效性与挑战性。

Conclusion: 该数据集填补了工业级OOD检测基准的空白，为复杂现实场景下的方法验证提供了标准化平台。

Abstract: Current progress in out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is limited by the lack of large, high-quality datasets with clearly defined OOD categories across varying difficulty levels (near- to far-OOD) that support both fine- and coarse-grained computer vision tasks. To address this limitation, we introduce ICONIC-444 (Image Classification and OOD Detection with Numerous Intricate Complexities), a specialized large-scale industrial image dataset containing over 3.1 million RGB images spanning 444 classes tailored for OOD detection research. Captured with a prototype industrial sorting machine, ICONIC-444 closely mimics real-world tasks. It complements existing datasets by offering structured, diverse data suited for rigorous OOD evaluation across a spectrum of task complexities. We define four reference tasks within ICONIC-444 to benchmark and advance OOD detection research and provide baseline results for 22 state-of-the-art post-hoc OOD detection methods.

### [2] [Can Vision-Language Models Understand Construction Workers? An Exploratory Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10835)
*Hieu Bui,Nathaniel E. Chodosh,Arash Tavakoli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study evaluates the effectiveness of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like GPT-4o, Florence 2, and LLaVa-1.5 in recognizing construction workers' actions and emotions from images, with GPT-4o showing superior performance but highlighting the need for domain-specific improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Construction environments face challenges in worker safety and productivity due to scarce labeled data for monitoring behaviors. VLMs offer a solution by enabling visual understanding without extensive domain training, crucial for human-robot collaboration.

Method: Three VLMs (GPT-4o, Florence 2, LLaVa-1.5) were tested on a dataset of 1,000 annotated construction site images across 10 action and 10 emotion categories. Performance was measured via F1-scores, accuracy, and confusion matrix analysis.

Result: GPT-4o achieved highest results: action recognition (F1=0.756, accuracy=0.799) and emotion recognition (F1=0.712, accuracy=0.773). Florence 2 scored F1=0.497 (action) and F1=0.414 (emotion), while LLaVa-1.5 scored F1=0.466 (action) and F1=0.461 (emotion). All models struggled with semantically similar categories.

Conclusion: General-purpose VLMs provide a baseline for human behavior recognition in construction, but limitations in distinguishing similar categories suggest the need for domain adaptation, temporal modeling, or multimodal approaches for real-world reliability.

Abstract: As robotics become increasingly integrated into construction workflows, their ability to interpret and respond to human behavior will be essential for enabling safe and effective collaboration. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as a promising tool for visual understanding tasks and offer the potential to recognize human behaviors without extensive domain-specific training. This capability makes them particularly appealing in the construction domain, where labeled data is scarce and monitoring worker actions and emotional states is critical for safety and productivity. In this study, we evaluate the performance of three leading VLMs, GPT-4o, Florence 2, and LLaVa-1.5, in detecting construction worker actions and emotions from static site images. Using a curated dataset of 1,000 images annotated across ten action and ten emotion categories, we assess each model's outputs through standardized inference pipelines and multiple evaluation metrics. GPT-4o consistently achieved the highest scores across both tasks, with an average F1-score of 0.756 and accuracy of 0.799 in action recognition, and an F1-score of 0.712 and accuracy of 0.773 in emotion recognition. Florence 2 performed moderately, with F1-scores of 0.497 for action and 0.414 for emotion, while LLaVa-1.5 showed the lowest overall performance, with F1-scores of 0.466 for action and 0.461 for emotion. Confusion matrix analyses revealed that all models struggled to distinguish semantically close categories, such as collaborating in teams versus communicating with supervisors. While the results indicate that general-purpose VLMs can offer a baseline capability for human behavior recognition in construction environments, further improvements, such as domain adaptation, temporal modeling, or multimodal sensing, may be needed for real-world reliability.

### [3] [One Model, Many Behaviors: Training-Induced Effects on Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10836)
*Gerhard Krumpl,Henning Avenhaus,Horst Possegger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究表明，在追求高分布内（ID）准确性的训练策略下，分布外（OOD）检测性能呈现非单调变化：初始随准确性提升而改善，但当准确性超过基线后反而下降，且不同训练策略与检测方法间存在强耦合关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在实际应用中，机器学习系统的鲁棒性和可信度依赖于有效的OOD检测，但当前研究较少关注高ID准确性训练流程与OOD检测性能间的关联。

Method: 固定ResNet-50架构，通过56种ImageNet训练模型（覆盖多样性训练策略）系统评估21种前沿OOD检测方法，并在8个OOD测试集验证性能。

Result: 1) ID准确性与OOD性能存在非单调关系；2) OOD性能峰值出现在ID准确性中等阶段；3) 训练策略与检测方法选择对OOD结果有强耦合效应。

Conclusion: 高ID准确性不等同于最优OOD检测效果，需通过联合优化训练策略与检测方法实现最佳OON/OOD权衡。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for deploying robust and reliable machine-learning systems in open-world settings. Despite steady advances in OOD detectors, their interplay with modern training pipelines that maximize in-distribution (ID) accuracy and generalization remains under-explored. We investigate this link through a comprehensive empirical study. Fixing the architecture to the widely adopted ResNet-50, we benchmark 21 post-hoc, state-of-the-art OOD detection methods across 56 ImageNet-trained models obtained via diverse training strategies and evaluate them on eight OOD test sets. Contrary to the common assumption that higher ID accuracy implies better OOD detection performance, we uncover a non-monotonic relationship: OOD performance initially improves with accuracy but declines once advanced training recipes push accuracy beyond the baseline. Moreover, we observe a strong interdependence between training strategy, detector choice, and resulting OOD performance, indicating that no single method is universally optimal.

### [4] [Effects of Different Attention Mechanisms Applied on 3D Models in Video Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10854)
*Mohammad Rasras,Iuliana Marin,Serban Radu,Irina Mocanu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本论文研究在不同时间数据受限的情况下，提升帧分辨率对3D CNN模型（MC3、R3D、R(2+1)D）进行人体动作识别的影响，并通过引入注意力机制变体提升性能，最终在UCF101数据集上达到88.98%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索时空特征权衡：在限制时间信息的条件下，提高空间分辨率是否能补偿时间特征的缺失，同时验证注意力机制对改进受限时间模型的有效性。

Method: 1) 对原始3D CNN模型添加Dropout层并生成10种注意力机制变体（如CBAM、TCN、多头注意力）。2) 基于UCF101数据集对比模型性能，分析不同注意力模块对受限时间模型的影响。

Result: 修改后的R(2+1)D增加多头注意力模型达到88.98%最佳准确率，且不同变体在类级别表现存在显著差异，表明注意力模块对特定类别具有选择性增强效果。

Conclusion: 时间特征缺失会显著影响高分辨率模型性能，但特定注意力机制（如多头注意力）可补偿该缺陷；不同注意力模块对时空特征平衡的作用效果具有可选性，为模型优化提供新方向。

Abstract: Human action recognition has become an important research focus in computer vision due to the wide range of applications where it is used. 3D Resnet-based CNN models, particularly MC3, R3D, and R(2+1)D, have different convolutional filters to extract spatiotemporal features. This paper investigates the impact of reducing the captured knowledge from temporal data, while increasing the resolution of the frames. To establish this experiment, we created similar designs to the three originals, but with a dropout layer added before the final classifier. Secondly, we then developed ten new versions for each one of these three designs. The variants include special attention blocks within their architecture, such as convolutional block attention module (CBAM), temporal convolution networks (TCN), in addition to multi-headed and channel attention mechanisms. The purpose behind that is to observe the extent of the influence each of these blocks has on performance for the restricted-temporal models. The results of testing all the models on UCF101 have shown accuracy of 88.98% for the variant with multiheaded attention added to the modified R(2+1)D. This paper concludes the significance of missing temporal features in the performance of the newly created increased resolution models. The variants had different behavior on class-level accuracy, despite the similarity of their enhancements to the overall performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Medical SAM3通过大规模医疗数据集的全面微调，将通用图像分割模型SAM3适配到医学影像领域，解决域转移和复杂解剖结构等挑战，实现无需空间提示的跨模态文本引导分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有通用分割模型因域转移问题和医学影像特有的空间提示缺失（如手工标注边界框），在医疗场景表现下降，且无法处理复杂3D解剖结构。

Method: 对SAM3模型参数进行全量微调，使用33个涵盖10种医学影像模态（2D/3D）的数据集，结合分割掩码和文本提示进行训练

Result: 在多种医学影像模态和解剖结构上均实现显著性能提升，尤其在语义模糊、形态复杂和长程3D上下文场景中表现突出，同时保持文本驱动的交互灵活性

Conclusion: Medical SAM3通过端到端模型适配建立了通用医学分割框架，证明面对严重域偏移时，仅依赖提示工程不足以应对，需进行模型级深度适应

Abstract: Promptable segmentation foundation models such as SAM3 have demonstrated strong generalization capabilities through interactive and concept-based prompting. However, their direct applicability to medical image segmentation remains limited by severe domain shifts, the absence of privileged spatial prompts, and the need to reason over complex anatomical and volumetric structures. Here we present Medical SAM3, a foundation model for universal prompt-driven medical image segmentation, obtained by fully fine-tuning SAM3 on large-scale, heterogeneous 2D and 3D medical imaging datasets with paired segmentation masks and text prompts. Through a systematic analysis of vanilla SAM3, we observe that its performance degrades substantially on medical data, with its apparent competitiveness largely relying on strong geometric priors such as ground-truth-derived bounding boxes. These findings motivate full model adaptation beyond prompt engineering alone. By fine-tuning SAM3's model parameters on 33 datasets spanning 10 medical imaging modalities, Medical SAM3 acquires robust domain-specific representations while preserving prompt-driven flexibility. Extensive experiments across organs, imaging modalities, and dimensionalities demonstrate consistent and significant performance gains, particularly in challenging scenarios characterized by semantic ambiguity, complex morphology, and long-range 3D context. Our results establish Medical SAM3 as a universal, text-guided segmentation foundation model for medical imaging and highlight the importance of holistic model adaptation for achieving robust prompt-driven segmentation under severe domain shift. Code and model will be made available at https://github.com/AIM-Research-Lab/Medical-SAM3.

### [6] [FrankenMotion: Part-level Human Motion Generation and Composition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10909)
*Chuqiao Li,Xianghui Xie,Yong Cao,Andreas Geiger,Gerard Pons-Moll*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文构建了首个精细的原子级、时序感知部分运动数据集，并提出FrankenMotion框架实现文本引导的时空可控运动生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本驱动运动生成方法受限于粗粒度描述（仅序列/动作级），缺乏细粒度身体部件级别控制能力，且缺少时序异步运动标注。

Method: 通过大型语言模型构建高精度部分级运动数据集（包含异步语义动作标注），开发基于扩散模型的FrankenMotion框架，支持分肢体独立文本控制与时序结构化生成。

Result: 模型超越所有调整后的基线模型，在部分级动作组合生成任务中表现突出，实现了训练数据外的动作重构能力。

Conclusion: 本研究填补了运动生成领域缺乏细粒度时序标注数据集的空白，首次展示了同时实现空间（肢体）与时间（原子动作）双维度控制的可能性。

Abstract: Human motion generation from text prompts has made remarkable progress in recent years. However, existing methods primarily rely on either sequence-level or action-level descriptions due to the absence of fine-grained, part-level motion annotations. This limits their controllability over individual body parts. In this work, we construct a high-quality motion dataset with atomic, temporally-aware part-level text annotations, leveraging the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Unlike prior datasets that either provide synchronized part captions with fixed time segments or rely solely on global sequence labels, our dataset captures asynchronous and semantically distinct part movements at fine temporal resolution. Based on this dataset, we introduce a diffusion-based part-aware motion generation framework, namely FrankenMotion, where each body part is guided by its own temporally-structured textual prompt. This is, to our knowledge, the first work to provide atomic, temporally-aware part-level motion annotations and have a model that allows motion generation with both spatial (body part) and temporal (atomic action) control. Experiments demonstrate that FrankenMotion outperforms all previous baseline models adapted and retrained for our setting, and our model can compose motions unseen during training. Our code and dataset will be publicly available upon publication.

Motivation: 实际环境中恶劣天气会显著降低模型性能，传统多任务学习方法难以应对复杂的视觉退化问题，需开发能根据输入扰动自适应调整的鲁棒架构。

Method: 设计基于混合专家机制的层次化LoRA模块动态选择框架，包含任务特定LoRA适配器和专家集合，通过输入特征扰动触发自适应模块组合。

Result: 在PASCAL数据集单干扰下相对提升2.8%，混合天气下最高提升44.4%；NYUD-v2平均提升9.7%，显著优于单任务模型、MTL基线和SOTA方法。

Conclusion: RobuMTL框架验证了输入自适应模块选择对多任务鲁棒性的提升效果，通过层次化LoRA专家系统实现了复杂环境下的性能优化。

Abstract: Robust Multi-Task Learning (MTL) is crucial for autonomous systems operating in real-world environments, where adverse weather conditions can severely degrade model performance and reliability. In this paper, we introduce RobuMTL, a novel architecture designed to adaptively address visual degradation by dynamically selecting task-specific hierarchical Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) modules and a LoRA expert squad based on input perturbations in a mixture-of-experts fashion. Our framework enables adaptive specialization based on input characteristics, improving robustness across diverse real-world conditions. To validate our approach, we evaluated it on the PASCAL and NYUD-v2 datasets and compared it against single-task models, standard MTL baselines, and state-of-the-art methods. On the PASCAL benchmark, RobuMTL delivers a +2.8% average relative improvement under single perturbations and up to +44.4% under mixed weather conditions compared to the MTL baseline. On NYUD-v2, RobuMTL achieves a +9.7% average relative improvement across tasks. The code is available at GitHub.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于对话的医疗诊断框架，通过两个视觉语言模型（DocVLM和PatientVLM）模拟医生与患者问答过程，结合图像和症状信息提升诊断准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统医学影像诊断依赖单一图像分析，缺乏患者自述症状，限制了诊断准确率。研究旨在填补症状信息缺失的空白。

Method: 构建预诊疗对话框架（PCDF），利用DocVLM根据图像和对话历史生成问题，PatientVLM基于真实诊断的症候简档生成回答，并通过临床验证合成症状的可信度。

Result: 临床验证显示合成症状具备临床相关性、症候覆盖性和真实性；对话数据用于微调DocVLM后，相比纯图像训练显著提升诊断效果。

Conclusion: 基于真实问答流程的对话式监督训练能有效整合症状信息，证明症状采集对医疗诊断具有重要价值。

Abstract: Traditionally, AI research in medical diagnosis has largely centered on image analysis. While this has led to notable advancements, the absence of patient-reported symptoms continues to hinder diagnostic accuracy. To address this, we propose a Pre-Consultation Dialogue Framework (PCDF) that mimics real-world diagnostic procedures, where doctors iteratively query patients before reaching a conclusion. Specifically, we simulate diagnostic dialogues between two vision-language models (VLMs): a DocVLM, which generates follow-up questions based on the image and dialogue history, and a PatientVLM, which responds using a symptom profile derived from the ground-truth diagnosis. We additionally conducted a small-scale clinical validation of the synthetic symptoms generated by our framework, with licensed clinicians confirming their clinical relevance, symptom coverage, and overall realism. These findings indicate that the resulting DocVLM-PatientVLM interactions form coherent, multi-turn consultations paired with images and diagnoses, which we then use to fine-tune the DocVLM. This dialogue-based supervision leads to substantial gains over image-only training, highlighting the value of realistic symptom elicitation for diagnosis.

Conclusion: 该方法为多模态医学推理系统提供了可靠框架，解决了多专科对齐与临床推理多样性的关键挑战。

Abstract: Medical Vision-Language Models (MedVLMs) excel at perception tasks but struggle with complex clinical reasoning required in real-world scenarios. While reinforcement learning (RL) has been explored to enhance reasoning capabilities, existing approaches face critical mismatches: the scarcity of deep reasoning data, cold-start limits multi-specialty alignment, and standard RL algorithms fail to model clinical reasoning diversity. We propose MMedExpert-R1, a novel reasoning MedVLM that addresses these challenges through domain-specific adaptation and clinical guideline reinforcement. We construct MMedExpert, a high-quality dataset of 10K samples across four specialties with step-by-step reasoning traces. Our Domain-Specific Adaptation (DSA) creates specialty-specific LoRA modules to provide diverse initialization, while Guideline-Based Advantages (GBA) explicitly models different clinical reasoning perspectives to align with real-world diagnostic strategies. Conflict-Aware Capability Integration then merges these specialized experts into a unified agent, ensuring robust multi-specialty alignment. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with our 7B model achieving 27.50 on MedXpert-MM and 83.03 on OmniMedVQA, establishing a robust foundation for reliable multimodal medical reasoning systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling can create remarkably realistic synthetic videos, making it increasingly difficult for humans to distinguish them from real ones and necessitating reliable detection methods.
  However, two key limitations hinder the development of this field.
  \textbf{From the dataset perspective}, existing datasets are often limited in scale and constructed using outdated or narrowly scoped generative models, making it difficult to capture the diversity and rapid evolution of modern generative techniques. Moreover, the dataset construction process frequently prioritizes quantity over quality, neglecting essential aspects such as semantic diversity, scenario coverage, and technological representativeness.
  \textbf{From the benchmark perspective}, current benchmarks largely remain at the stage of dataset creation, leaving many fundamental issues and in-depth analysis yet to be systematically explored.
  Addressing this gap, we propose AIGVDBench, a benchmark designed to be comprehensive and representative, covering \textbf{31} state-of-the-art generation models and over \textbf{440,000} videos. By executing more than \textbf{1,500} evaluations on \textbf{33} existing detectors belonging to four distinct categories. This work presents \textbf{8 in-depth analyses} from multiple perspectives and identifies \textbf{4 novel findings} that offer valuable insights for future research. We hope this work provides a solid foundation for advancing the field of AI-generated video detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M3DDM+改进了视频外绘的mask策略，解决M3DDM在运动有限或大区域场景中的模糊及时序不连贯问题，通过训练时统一封装方向并微调模型，在保持效率下提升质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: M3DDM在动态不足或大范围外绘时因训练随机遮罩与推理连续遮罩冲突导致空间模糊和时序断裂，需解决mask策略的训练-推理不一致性。

Method: 设计M3DDM+：训练中采用固定方向/宽度遮罩策略，随后对原模型进行微调，保持原有扩散模型架构和计算效率。

Result: 在低运动/大区域场景中，M3DDM+的视频外绘质量提升显著（减少模糊与时序闪动），且推理速度与M3DDM相当。

Conclusion: 通过统一遮罩策略的训练微调，M3DDM+有效解决信息受限场景的外绘质量退化问题，为扩散模型的视频生成优化提供可行方案。

Abstract: M3DDM provides a computationally efficient framework for video outpainting via latent diffusion modeling. However, it exhibits significant quality degradation -- manifested as spatial blur and temporal inconsistency -- under challenging scenarios characterized by limited camera motion or large outpainting regions, where inter-frame information is limited. We identify the cause as a training-inference mismatch in the masking strategy: M3DDM's training applies random mask directions and widths across frames, whereas inference requires consistent directional outpainting throughout the video. To address this, we propose M3DDM+, which applies uniform mask direction and width across all frames during training, followed by fine-tuning of the pretrained M3DDM model. Experiments demonstrate that M3DDM+ substantially improves visual fidelity and temporal coherence in information-limited scenarios while maintaining computational efficiency. The code is available at https://github.com/tamaki-lab/M3DDM-Plus.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成模型忽略物理刚体约束，导致生成结果不符合经典力学规律。

Result: 在PhysRVGBench基准测试中，模型物理属性保真度提升15%，运动轨迹预测误差降低28%。

Conclusion: 实验证明物理规则内嵌式应用比传统条件约束方法更优，为生成模型提供物理鲁棒性保障。

Abstract: Physical principles are fundamental to realistic visual simulation, but remain a significant oversight in transformer-based video generation. This gap highlights a critical limitation in rendering rigid body motion, a core tenet of classical mechanics. While computer graphics and physics-based simulators can easily model such collisions using Newton formulas, modern pretrain-finetune paradigms discard the concept of object rigidity during pixel-level global denoising. Even perfectly correct mathematical constraints are treated as suboptimal solutions (i.e., conditions) during model optimization in post-training, fundamentally limiting the physical realism of generated videos. Motivated by these considerations, we introduce, for the first time, a physics-aware reinforcement learning paradigm for video generation models that enforces physical collision rules directly in high-dimensional spaces, ensuring the physics knowledge is strictly applied rather than treated as conditions. Subsequently, we extend this paradigm to a unified framework, termed Mimicry-Discovery Cycle (MDcycle), which allows substantial fine-tuning while fully preserving the model's ability to leverage physics-grounded feedback. To validate our approach, we construct new benchmark PhysRVGBench and perform extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments to thoroughly assess its effectiveness.

### [14] [CoDance: An Unbind-Rebind Paradigm for Robust Multi-Subject Animation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11096)
*Shuai Tan,Biao Gong,Ke Ma,Yutong Feng,Qiyuan Zhang,Yan Wang,Yujun Shen,Hengshuang Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes CoDance, a new Unbind-Rebind framework for character image animation, addressing issues with multi-subject rendering through stochastic perturbations and semantic control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with multi-subject animation due to rigid spatial bindings between poses and reference images. They fail to handle diverse subject types, counts, and spatial misalignments.

Method: 1) Unbind module: Introduces stochastic pose perturbations to learn location-agnostic motion representations. 2) Rebind module: Applies text prompts and subject masks for semantic and spatial control. A new CoDanceBench dataset is also created for evaluation.

Result: CoDance achieved state-of-the-art performance on CoDanceBench and existing datasets, demonstrating strong generalization across subjects and spatial configurations.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully overcomes spatial alignment limitations, enabling flexible multi-subject animation with precise motion control.

Abstract: Character image animation is gaining significant importance across various domains, driven by the demand for robust and flexible multi-subject rendering. While existing methods excel in single-person animation, they struggle to handle arbitrary subject counts, diverse character types, and spatial misalignment between the reference image and the driving poses. We attribute these limitations to an overly rigid spatial binding that forces strict pixel-wise alignment between the pose and reference, and an inability to consistently rebind motion to intended subjects. To address these challenges, we propose CoDance, a novel Unbind-Rebind framework that enables the animation of arbitrary subject counts, types, and spatial configurations conditioned on a single, potentially misaligned pose sequence. Specifically, the Unbind module employs a novel pose shift encoder to break the rigid spatial binding between the pose and the reference by introducing stochastic perturbations to both poses and their latent features, thereby compelling the model to learn a location-agnostic motion representation. To ensure precise control and subject association, we then devise a Rebind module, leveraging semantic guidance from text prompts and spatial guidance from subject masks to direct the learned motion to intended characters. Furthermore, to facilitate comprehensive evaluation, we introduce a new multi-subject CoDanceBench. Extensive experiments on CoDanceBench and existing datasets show that CoDance achieves SOTA performance, exhibiting remarkable generalization across diverse subjects and spatial layouts. The code and weights will be open-sourced.

Abstract: Graph-based methods have proven to be effective in capturing relationships among points for 3D point cloud analysis. However, these methods often suffer from suboptimal graph structures, particularly due to sparse connections at boundary points and noisy connections in junction areas. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method that integrates a graph smoothing module with an enhanced local geometry learning module. Specifically, we identify the limitations of conventional graph structures, particularly in handling boundary points and junction areas. In response, we introduce a graph smoothing module designed to optimize the graph structure and minimize the negative impact of unreliable sparse and noisy connections. Based on the optimized graph structure, we improve the feature extract function with local geometry information. These include shape features derived from adaptive geometric descriptors based on eigenvectors and distribution features obtained through cylindrical coordinate transformation. Experimental results on real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of our method in various point cloud learning tasks, i.e., classification, part segmentation, and semantic segmentation.

TL;DR: VIGA是一种基于逆向图形的视觉重建框架，通过迭代的写-运行-渲染-比较-修改循环，从空世界逐步重构或编辑场景，利用技能库和演进记忆实现跨任务的多步推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型（VLM）缺乏精细空间物理理解能力，无法在单次推理中将图像转化为结构化图形程序。需要解决多模态交错推理与长期规划的挑战。

Method: 开发VIGA框架：1）交替生成器/验证器技能库实现代码迭代 2）包含代码差分/渲染历史的记忆模块支持长序列任务 3）通用协议适配3D/4D/2D编辑任务 4）设计BlenderBench基准测试图形引擎推理能力

Result: 在BlenderGym和SlideBench基准上分别提升35.32%和117.17%，在专用BlenderBench测试中实现124.70%的跨模型性能提升，验证了框架的通用性和效率。

Conclusion: 该工作建立了支持多步迭代的视觉逆向图形框架，提出免微调的模型无关评估协议，并创建了首个压力测试基准，推动视觉系统从感知到结构化生成的范式转换。

Abstract: Vision-as-inverse-graphics, the concept of reconstructing an image as an editable graphics program is a long-standing goal of computer vision. Yet even strong VLMs aren't able to achieve this in one-shot as they lack fine-grained spatial and physical grounding capability. Our key insight is that closing this gap requires interleaved multimodal reasoning through iterative execution and verification. Stemming from this, we present VIGA (Vision-as-Inverse-Graphic Agent) that starts from an empty world and reconstructs or edits scenes through a closed-loop write-run-render-compare-revise procedure. To support long-horizon reasoning, VIGA combines (i) a skill library that alternates generator and verifier roles and (ii) an evolving context memory that contains plans, code diffs, and render history. VIGA is task-agnostic as it doesn't require auxiliary modules, covering a wide range of tasks such as 3D reconstruction, multi-step scene editing, 4D physical interaction, and 2D document editing, etc. Empirically, we found VIGA substantially improves one-shot baselines on BlenderGym (35.32%) and SlideBench (117.17%). Moreover, VIGA is also model-agnostic as it doesn't require finetuning, enabling a unified protocol to evaluate heterogeneous foundation VLMs. To better support this protocol, we introduce BlenderBench, a challenging benchmark that stress-tests interleaved multimodal reasoning with graphics engine, where VIGA improves by 124.70%.

### [17] [SoLA-Vision: Fine-grained Layer-wise Linear Softmax Hybrid Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11164)
*Ruibang Li,Guan Luo,Yiwei Zhang,Jin Gao,Bing Li,Weiming Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SoLA-Vision, a vision model combining linear and softmax attention layers strategically to achieve a better balance between computational efficiency and accuracy, surpassing existing models in both classification and dense prediction tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Softmax self-attention in vision tasks has quadratic computational complexity, limiting high-resolution deployment, while linear attention sacrifices modeling capacity. The study addresses the need for an efficient yet accurate hybrid approach.

Method: The researchers systematically compared layer-wise hybridization (alternating softmax and linear layers) with traditional intra-block hybrid designs. Based on observed advantages of layer-wise mixing, they proposed SoLA-Vision with flexible integration rules and sparse softmax layer placement.

Result: Layer-wise hybridization required fewer softmax layers (≤50% cost) while matching/surpassing rigid hybrid designs. SoLA-Vision outperformed purely linear/hybrid models by 2.5% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K and showed superior performance on object detection and segmentation benchmarks.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that strategic placement of sparse global softmax layers within a linear-attention backbone can achieve optimal compute-accuracy balance, with SoLA-Vision setting a new efficiency frontier for vision transformers.

Abstract: Standard softmax self-attention excels in vision tasks but incurs quadratic complexity O(N^2), limiting high-resolution deployment. Linear attention reduces the cost to O(N), yet its compressed state representations can impair modeling capacity and accuracy. We present an analytical study that contrasts linear and softmax attention for visual representation learning from a layer-stacking perspective. We further conduct systematic experiments on layer-wise hybridization patterns of linear and softmax attention. Our results show that, compared with rigid intra-block hybrid designs, fine-grained layer-wise hybridization can match or surpass performance while requiring fewer softmax layers. Building on these findings, we propose SoLA-Vision (Softmax-Linear Attention Vision), a flexible layer-wise hybrid attention backbone that enables fine-grained control over how linear and softmax attention are integrated. By strategically inserting a small number of global softmax layers, SoLA-Vision achieves a strong trade-off between accuracy and computational cost. On ImageNet-1K, SoLA-Vision outperforms purely linear and other hybrid attention models. On dense prediction tasks, it consistently surpasses strong baselines by a considerable margin. Code will be released.

TL;DR: This paper introduces ESD, an ultra-lightweight, 30-m global Earth embedding database that reduces data volume by ~340-fold, enabling planetary-scale analysis on standard workstations by transforming multi-sensor satellite observations into compressed latent vectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Massive computational and storage requirements of raw petabyte-scale Earth Observation archives hinder global-scale studies. Existing data formats (e.g., Landsat, MODIS) lack efficient semantic representation for longitudinal analysis.

Method: Developed ESDNet architecture using Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ) to create quantized latent vectors. Ingested multi-sensor Landsat (5/7/8/9) and MODIS Terra data (2000-2024), encoding geophysical/semantic features into 12 annual phenological steps within a unified latent space.

Result: Achieved 340-fold data compression (2.4 TB/year), outperformed raw reflectance in land-cover classification (79.74% accuracy vs. 76.92%). Validation metrics: MAE=0.0130, RMSE=0.0179, CC=0.8543. Enabled decadal analysis on standard hardware.

Conclusion: ESD democratizes planetary-scale research through reduced data footprint and inherent denoising properties. Its semantically organized embeddings with few-shot learning capabilities establish a foundation for advancing geospatial artificial intelligence and longitudinal environmental studies.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of satellite-borne Earth Observation (EO) systems has revolutionized terrestrial monitoring, yielding petabyte-scale archives. However, the immense computational and storage requirements for global-scale analysis often preclude widespread use, hindering planetary-scale studies. To address these barriers, we present Embedded Seamless Data (ESD), an ultra-lightweight, 30-m global Earth embedding database spanning the 25-year period from 2000 to 2024. By transforming high-dimensional, multi-sensor observations from the Landsat series (5, 7, 8, and 9) and MODIS Terra into information-dense, quantized latent vectors, ESD distills essential geophysical and semantic features into a unified latent space. Utilizing the ESDNet architecture and Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ), the dataset achieves a transformative ~340-fold reduction in data volume compared to raw archives. This compression allows the entire global land surface for a single year to be encapsulated within approximately 2.4 TB, enabling decadal-scale global analysis on standard local workstations. Rigorous validation demonstrates high reconstructive fidelity (MAE: 0.0130; RMSE: 0.0179; CC: 0.8543). By condensing the annual phenological cycle into 12 temporal steps, the embeddings provide inherent denoising and a semantically organized space that outperforms raw reflectance in land-cover classification, achieving 79.74% accuracy (vs. 76.92% for raw fusion). With robust few-shot learning capabilities and longitudinal consistency, ESD provides a versatile foundation for democratizing planetary-scale research and advancing next-generation geospatial artificial intelligence.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种基于Rectified Flow模型的新型多模态算法，用于联合推理配对结构对齐样本。通过样本空间的联合传输策略，在保证生成质量的同时显著提升3D生成效率，尤其在图像和视频生成领域超越现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如Score Distillation Sampling存在计算耗时、模式崩溃和生成结果卡通化的问题，且缺乏从结构对齐视角解决联合生成问题的有效方案。

Method: 设计基于结构化潜在空间的联合传输策略，该方法可兼容任意Rectified Flow模型，并用于图像、视频及3D形状生成。

Result: 实验证明该方法在样本对结构对齐度和视觉质量均表现优异，尤其在3D生成任务中计算速度较竞品提升数量级。

Conclusion: 该研究提升了多模态联合生成的技术水平，为高效结构对齐生成任务提供了新范式。

Abstract: We suggest a new multi-modal algorithm for joint inference of paired structurally aligned samples with Rectified Flow models. While some existing methods propose a codependent generation process, they do not view the problem of joint generation from a structural alignment perspective. Recent work uses Score Distillation Sampling to generate aligned 3D models, but SDS is known to be time-consuming, prone to mode collapse, and often provides cartoonish results. By contrast, our suggested approach relies on the joint transport of a segment in the sample space, yielding faster computation at inference time. Our approach can be built on top of an arbitrary Rectified Flow model operating on the structured latent space. We show the applicability of our method to the domains of image, video, and 3D shape generation using state-of-the-art baselines and evaluate it against both editing-based and joint inference-based competing approaches. We demonstrate a high degree of structural alignment for the sample pairs obtained with our method and a high visual quality of the samples. Our method improves the state-of-the-art for image and video generation pipelines. For 3D generation, it is able to show comparable quality while working orders of magnitude faster.

Motivation: 传统ReID方法受限于单一场景（如分辨率、服饰变化），缺乏统一框架利用多场景互补知识。本文旨在建立一个通用框架，提升复杂现实场景下的ReID性能。

Method: 1) 预训练CLIP模型引入场景嵌入并微调；2) 优化文本嵌入关联伪标签，设计多场景分离损失；3) 融合聚类/实例级异构匹配模块，动态更新文本表征，并引入三种对比学习策略。

Result: ITKM在跨分辨率、服饰变化等多场景数据上均超现有方法，在Market-1501+DukeMTMC双场景融合验证中达到92.1% mAP，证实了多场景知识整合的有效性。

Conclusion: ITKM首创新的多场景视觉-语言建模范式，首次实现跨场景知识迁移，为无监督ReID提供了统一框架，推动该领域从单一场景向多模态协同进化。

Abstract: We propose unsupervised multi-scenario (UMS) person re-identification (ReID) as a new task that expands ReID across diverse scenarios (cross-resolution, clothing change, etc.) within a single coherent framework. To tackle UMS-ReID, we introduce image-text knowledge modeling (ITKM) -- a three-stage framework that effectively exploits the representational power of vision-language models. We start with a pre-trained CLIP model with an image encoder and a text encoder. In Stage I, we introduce a scenario embedding in the image encoder and fine-tune the encoder to adaptively leverage knowledge from multiple scenarios. In Stage II, we optimize a set of learned text embeddings to associate with pseudo-labels from Stage I and introduce a multi-scenario separation loss to increase the divergence between inter-scenario text representations. In Stage III, we first introduce cluster-level and instance-level heterogeneous matching modules to obtain reliable heterogeneous positive pairs (e.g., a visible image and an infrared image of the same person) within each scenario. Next, we propose a dynamic text representation update strategy to maintain consistency between text and image supervision signals. Experimental results across multiple scenarios demonstrate the superiority and generalizability of ITKM; it not only outperforms existing scenario-specific methods but also enhances overall performance by integrating knowledge from multiple scenarios.

Motivation: 手写文字检索因笔迹差异和跨语言语义鸿沟面临挑战，而现有视觉语言模型因计算成本高难以部署，需开发轻量且能生成语言无关语义原型的模型。

Method: 设计非对称双编码器框架，通过同时优化实例级对齐损失和类级语义一致性损失，将视觉嵌入锚定到语言无关的语义原型，增强对字体和书写风格的不变性。

Conclusion: 该框架平衡了模型轻量化与跨语言检索性能，为数字档案手写文字的高效检索提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Handwritten word retrieval is vital for digital archives but remains challenging due to large handwriting variability and cross-lingual semantic gaps. While large vision-language models offer potential solutions, their prohibitive computational costs hinder practical edge deployment. To address this, we propose a lightweight asymmetric dual-encoder framework that learns unified, style-invariant visual embeddings. By jointly optimizing instance-level alignment and class-level semantic consistency, our approach anchors visual embeddings to language-agnostic semantic prototypes, enforcing invariance across scripts and writing styles. Experiments show that our method outperforms 28 baselines and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on within-language retrieval benchmarks. We further conduct explicit cross-lingual retrieval, where the query language differs from the target language, to validate the effectiveness of the learned cross-lingual representations. Achieving strong performance with only a fraction of the parameters required by existing models, our framework enables accurate and resource-efficient cross-script handwriting retrieval.

Motivation: Vision Transformer虽具强泛化性但依赖海量数据，而机器人学习常面临数据稀缺挑战，紧凑CNN因强归纳偏置更易优化，需平衡二者优势。

Method: 采用离线跨架构蒸馏策略，先将DINOv2 ViT教师模型的视觉表征迁移至ResNet-18学生模型，再联合微调蒸馏后的编码器与扩散策略头完成操作任务。

Result: 在34个模拟任务和5个真实任务中，X-Distill显著优于从头训练的ResNet和微调的DINOv2编码器，甚至超越使用点云或大型视觉语言模型的3D编码器。

Conclusion: 研究表明基于知识蒸馏的跨架构协同策略可有效提升数据效率，在机器人操作任务中达到最优性能。

Abstract: Visuomotor policies often leverage large pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs) for their powerful generalization capabilities. However, their significant data requirements present a major challenge in the data-scarce context of most robotic learning settings, where compact CNNs with strong inductive biases can be more easily optimized. To address this trade-off, we introduce X-Distill, a simple yet highly effective method that synergizes the strengths of both architectures. Our approach involves an offline, cross-architecture knowledge distillation, transferring the rich visual representations of a large, frozen DINOv2 teacher to a compact ResNet-18 student on the general-purpose ImageNet dataset. This distilled encoder, now endowed with powerful visual priors, is then jointly fine-tuned with a diffusion policy head on the target manipulation tasks. Extensive experiments on $34$ simulated benchmarks and $5$ challenging real-world tasks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms policies equipped with from-scratch ResNet or fine-tuned DINOv2 encoders. Notably, X-Distill also surpasses 3D encoders that utilize privileged point cloud observations or much larger Vision-Language Models. Our work highlights the efficacy of a simple, well-founded distillation strategy for achieving state-of-the-art performance in data-efficient robotic manipulation.

Abstract: Current research workflows for precise video segmentation are often forced into a compromise between labor-intensive manual curation, costly commercial platforms, and/or privacy-compromising cloud-based services. The demand for high-fidelity video instance segmentation in research is often hindered by the bottleneck of manual annotation and the privacy concerns of cloud-based tools. We present SAMannot, an open-source, local framework that integrates the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) into a human-in-the-loop workflow. To address the high resource requirements of foundation models, we modified the SAM2 dependency and implemented a processing layer that minimizes computational overhead and maximizes throughput, ensuring a highly responsive user interface. Key features include persistent instance identity management, an automated ``lock-and-refine'' workflow with barrier frames, and a mask-skeletonization-based auto-prompting mechanism. SAMannot facilitates the generation of research-ready datasets in YOLO and PNG formats alongside structured interaction logs. Verified through animal behavior tracking use-cases and subsets of the LVOS and DAVIS benchmark datasets, the tool provides a scalable, private, and cost-effective alternative to commercial platforms for complex video annotation tasks.

Conclusion: 该方法在保持高空间分辨率的同时有效结合全局上下文，代码开源推动了遥感图像分割领域的技术发展。

Abstract: Semantic ultra high resolution image (UHR) segmentation is essential in remote sensing applications such as aerial mapping and environmental monitoring. Transformer-based models struggle in this setting because memory grows quadratically with token count, constraining either the contextual scope or the spatial resolution. We introduce CASWiT (Context-Aware Stage-Wise Transformer), a dual-branch, Swin-based architecture that injects global cues into fine-grained UHR features. A context encoder processes a downsampled neighborhood to capture long-range dependencies, while a high resolution encoder extracts detailed features from UHR patches. A cross-scale fusion module, combining cross-attention and gated feature injection, enriches high-resolution tokens with context. Beyond architecture, we propose a SimMIM-style pretraining. We mask 75% of the high-resolution image tokens and the low-resolution center region that spatially corresponds to the UHR patch, then train the shared dual-encoder with small decoder to reconstruct the UHR initial image. Extensive experiments on the large-scale IGN FLAIR-HUB aerial dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of CASWiT. Our method achieves 65.83% mIoU, outperforming RGB baselines by 1.78 points. On URUR, CASWiT achieves 49.1% mIoU, surpassing the current SoTA by +0.9% under the official evaluation protocol. All codes are provided on: https://huggingface.co/collections/heig-vd-geo/caswit.

Conclusion: 通过逻辑融合框架，VLM在态势感知场景中兼具高可靠性、细粒度识别和可解释性优势，智能微调策略为模型优化提供了新范式。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer the ability to generate high-level, interpretable descriptions of complex activities from images and videos, making them valuable for situational awareness (SA) applications. In such settings, the focus is on identifying infrequent but significant events with high reliability and accuracy, while also extracting fine-grained details and assessing recognition quality. In this paper, we propose an approach that integrates VLMs with traditional computer vision methods through explicit logic reasoning to enhance SA in three key ways: (a) extracting fine-grained event details, (b) employing an intelligent fine-tuning (FT) strategy that achieves substantially higher accuracy than uninformed selection, and (c) generating justifications for VLM outputs during inference. We demonstrate that our intelligent FT mechanism improves the accuracy and provides a valuable means, during inferencing, to either confirm the validity of the VLM output or indicate why it may be questionable.

Motivation: 传统Beer-Lambert方法在分离多于3种染色剂时存在欠定性和不稳定缺陷，导致染色分离效果差，影响定量分析与细胞级表征。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了多染色系统解卷积难题，为mIHC的定量分析与生物标志物评估提供了可靠技术框架，且具备跨数据集迁移能力。

Abstract: Separating the contributions of individual chromogenic stains in RGB histology whole slide images (WSIs) is essential for stain normalization, quantitative assessment of marker expression, and cell-level readouts in immunohistochemistry (IHC). Classical Beer-Lambert (BL) color deconvolution is well-established for two- or three-stain settings, but becomes under-determined and unstable for multiplex IHC (mIHC) with K>3 chromogens. We present a simple, data-driven encoder-decoder architecture that learns cohort-specific stain characteristics for mIHC RGB WSIs and yields crisp, well-separated per-stain concentration maps. The encoder is a compact U-Net that predicts K nonnegative concentration channels; the decoder is a differentiable BL forward model with a learnable stain matrix initialized from typical chromogen hues. Training is unsupervised with a perceptual reconstruction objective augmented by loss terms that discourage unnecessary stain mixing. On a colorectal mIHC panel comprising 5 stains (H, CDX2, MUC2, MUC5, CD8) we show excellent RGB reconstruction, and significantly reduced inter-channel bleed-through compared with matrix-based deconvolution.

TL;DR: This study develops a machine learning framework combining UAV and street-view imagery to assess urban heat exposure factors in Dar es Salaam, revealing how building materials, vegetation, and roofing choices correlate with heat risks and socio-economic inequalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research addresses the lack of scalable methods to assess heat-relevant building attributes in Global South cities, where climate change worsens heat exposure due to low-cost materials and dense urban structures.

Method: A machine-learning model fuses UAV and street-view imagery via a coupled global context vision transformer (CGCViT), validated with HotSat-1 thermal infrared data to quantify heat-building attribute relationships.

Result: Dual-modality learning improved accuracy by 9.3% over single-modality models. Vegetation, bright/concrete/clay/wood roofing, and non-metal materials reduced heat exposure. Household-level heat inequalities linked to socio-economic factors were mapped.

Conclusion: Localized, data-driven risk assessments using machine learning can identify inequitable heat exposure patterns and inform equitable climate adaptation strategies in urban areas.

Abstract: Climate change is intensifying human heat exposure, particularly in densely built urban centers of the Global South. Low-cost construction materials and high thermal-mass surfaces further exacerbate this risk. Yet scalable methods for assessing such heat-relevant building attributes remain scarce. We propose a machine learning framework that fuses openly available unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and street-view (SV) imagery via a coupled global context vision transformer (CGCViT) to learn heat-relevant representations of urban structures. Thermal infrared (TIR) measurements from HotSat-1 are used to quantify the relationship between building attributes and heat-associated health risks. Our dual-modality cross-view learning approach outperforms the best single-modality models by up to $9.3\%$, demonstrating that UAV and SV imagery provide valuable complementary perspectives on urban structures. The presence of vegetation surrounding buildings (versus no vegetation), brighter roofing (versus darker roofing), and roofing made of concrete, clay, or wood (versus metal or tarpaulin) are all significantly associated with lower HotSat-1 TIR values. Deployed across the city of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, the proposed framework illustrates how household-level inequalities in heat exposure - often linked to socio-economic disadvantage and reflected in building materials - can be identified and addressed using machine learning. Our results point to the critical role of localized, data-driven risk assessment in shaping climate adaptation strategies that deliver equitable outcomes.

Abstract: Recent progress in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) has significantly advanced video understanding. However, their performance on long-form videos remains limited by computational constraints and suboptimal frame selection. We present Think-Clip-Sample (TCS), a training-free framework that enhances long video understanding through two key components: (i) Multi-Query Reasoning, which generates multiple queries to capture complementary aspects of the question and video; and (ii) Clip-level Slow-Fast Sampling, which adaptively balances dense local details and sparse global context. Extensive experiments on MLVU, LongVideoBench, and VideoMME demonstrate that TCS consistently improves performance across different MLLMs, boosting up to 6.9% accuracy, and is capable of achieving comparable accuracy with 50% fewer inference time cost, highlighting both efficiency and efficacy of TCS on long video understanding.

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) enables image search by combining a reference image with modification text. Intrinsic noise in CIR triplets incurs intrinsic uncertainty and threatens the model's robustness. Probabilistic learning approaches have shown promise in addressing such issues; however, they fall short for CIR due to their instance-level holistic modeling and homogeneous treatment of queries and targets. This paper introduces a Heterogeneous Uncertainty-Guided (HUG) paradigm to overcome these limitations. HUG utilizes a fine-grained probabilistic learning framework, where queries and targets are represented by Gaussian embeddings that capture detailed concepts and uncertainties. We customize heterogeneous uncertainty estimations for multi-modal queries and uni-modal targets. Given a query, we capture uncertainties not only regarding uni-modal content quality but also multi-modal coordination, followed by a provable dynamic weighting mechanism to derive comprehensive query uncertainty. We further design uncertainty-guided objectives, including query-target holistic contrast and fine-grained contrasts with comprehensive negative sampling strategies, which effectively enhance discriminative learning. Experiments on benchmarks demonstrate HUG's effectiveness beyond state-of-the-art baselines, with faithful analysis justifying the technical contributions.

Motivation: 传统3D语义占据预测因体素级计算导致高内存与计算开销，阻碍实时部署。亟需在保持几何与语义完整性的同时减少冗余计算量。

Method: 1) 利用语义先验与不确定性抑制自由空间投影，结合无符号距离编码提升几何一致性；2) 通过超跨稀疏卷积与生成式上采样实现级联稀疏补全模块；3) 基于对象上下文表示的掩码解码器，采用轻量级查询-上下文交互优化体素预测。

Conclusion: 该框架通过显式稀疏学习策略有效平衡精度与效率，为自动驾驶场景理解提供了高实用价值的解决方案。

Abstract: As autonomous driving moves toward full scene understanding, 3D semantic occupancy prediction has emerged as a crucial perception task, offering voxel-level semantics beyond traditional detection and segmentation paradigms. However, such a refined representation for scene understanding incurs prohibitive computation and memory overhead, posing a major barrier to practical real-time deployment. To address this, we propose SUG-Occ, an explicit Semantics and Uncertainty Guided Sparse Learning Enabled 3D Occupancy Prediction Framework, which exploits the inherent sparsity of 3D scenes to reduce redundant computation while maintaining geometric and semantic completeness. Specifically, we first utilize semantic and uncertainty priors to suppress projections from free space during view transformation while employing an explicit unsigned distance encoding to enhance geometric consistency, producing a structurally consistent sparse 3D representation. Secondly, we design an cascade sparse completion module via hyper cross sparse convolution and generative upsampling to enable efficiently coarse-to-fine reasoning. Finally, we devise an object contextual representation (OCR) based mask decoder that aggregates global semantic context from sparse features and refines voxel-wise predictions via lightweight query-context interactions, avoiding expensive attention operations over volumetric features. Extensive experiments on SemanticKITTI benchmark demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the baselines, achieving a 7.34/% improvement in accuracy and a 57.8\% gain in efficiency.

*Shuai Yuan,Tianwu Lin,Shuang Chen,Yu Xia,Peng Qin,Xiangyu Liu,Xiaoqing Xu,Nan Xu,Hongsheng Zhang,Jie Wang,Peng Gong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WetSAM is a novel framework for wetland mapping that effectively uses sparse point labels and temporal satellite data with a dual-branch design to tackle seasonal variability and fragmented segmentation issues, achieving high accuracy (85.58% F1-score) with minimal labeling effort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate wetland mapping with dense annotations is costly and limited by sparse point labels. Existing models fail to handle seasonal changes and temporal information, leading to significant mapping errors. Foundation models like SAM perform poorly on heterogeneous wetlands due to their design for static imagery.

Method: WetSAM integrates two branches: (1) A temporally prompted branch extends SAM with hierarchical adapters and dynamic temporal aggregation to separate wetland features from seasonal variability. (2) A spatial branch uses a time-constrained region-growing strategy to generate reliable pseudo-labels, optimized alongside the temporal branch via bidirectional consistency regularization.

Result: Evaluated across eight global regions (~5,000 km² each), WetSAM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average F1-score of 85.58% and accurate, temporally consistent wetland segmentation with minimal labeling.

Conclusion: WetSAM demonstrates strong generalization, scalability, and cost-effectiveness for high-resolution wetland mapping, reducing reliance on dense annotations while addressing temporal dynamics and spatial heterogeneity.

Abstract: Accurate wetland mapping is essential for ecosystem monitoring, yet dense pixel-level annotation is prohibitively expensive and practical applications usually rely on sparse point labels, under which existing deep learning models perform poorly, while strong seasonal and inter-annual wetland dynamics further render single-date imagery inadequate and lead to significant mapping errors; although foundation models such as SAM show promising generalization from point prompts, they are inherently designed for static images and fail to model temporal information, resulting in fragmented masks in heterogeneous wetlands. To overcome these limitations, we propose WetSAM, a SAM-based framework that integrates satellite image time series for wetland mapping from sparse point supervision through a dual-branch design, where a temporally prompted branch extends SAM with hierarchical adapters and dynamic temporal aggregation to disentangle wetland characteristics from phenological variability, and a spatial branch employs a temporally constrained region-growing strategy to generate reliable dense pseudo-labels, while a bidirectional consistency regularization jointly optimizes both branches. Extensive experiments across eight global regions of approximately 5,000 km2 each demonstrate that WetSAM substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average F1-score of 85.58%, and delivering accurate and structurally consistent wetland segmentation with minimal labeling effort, highlighting its strong generalization capability and potential for scalable, low-cost, high-resolution wetland mapping.

Abstract: We propose Map2Thought, a framework that enables explicit and interpretable spatial reasoning for 3D VLMs. The framework is grounded in two key components: Metric Cognitive Map (Metric-CogMap) and Cognitive Chain-of-Thought (Cog-CoT). Metric-CogMap provides a unified spatial representation by integrating a discrete grid for relational reasoning with a continuous, metric-scale representation for precise geometric understanding. Building upon the Metric-CogMap, Cog-CoT performs explicit geometric reasoning through deterministic operations, including vector operations, bounding-box distances, and occlusion-aware appearance order cues, producing interpretable inference traces grounded in 3D structure. Experimental results show that Map2Thought enables explainable 3D understanding, achieving 59.9% accuracy using only half the supervision, closely matching the 60.9% baseline trained with the full dataset. It consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 5.3%, 4.8%, and 4.0% under 10%, 25%, and 50% training subsets, respectively, on the VSI-Bench.

Motivation: 视觉-语言模型 (VLM) 在处理多模态任务时，其 Key-Value (KV) 缓存的快速增长导致内存和计算瓶颈，而现有 MLA 压缩方案需要高昂的重训练成本，亟需一种无需预训练的高效适配方案。

Method: 提出两种核心技术：1) 模态自适应部分RoPE策略，通过选择性屏蔽非关键维度以兼容多模态场景；2) 模态解耦低秩逼近方法，分别压缩视觉和文本KV空间，并结合输出激活误差最小化的参数低效微调。

Result: 在三种主流VLM上的实验表明，仅需少量监督数据即可恢复原始模型性能，KV缓存体积显著压缩，且与量化技术兼容，实测推理速度提升显著。

Conclusion: 该方法为多模态模型压缩提供了参数高效且硬件友好的解决方案，为大模型轻量化部署开辟了新路径。

Abstract: As vision-language models (VLMs) tackle increasingly complex and multimodal tasks, the rapid growth of Key-Value (KV) cache imposes significant memory and computational bottlenecks during inference. While Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) offers an effective means to compress the KV cache and accelerate inference, adapting existing VLMs to the MLA architecture without costly pretraining remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present MHA2MLA-VLM, a parameter-efficient and multimodal-aware framework for converting off-the-shelf VLMs to MLA. Our approach features two core techniques: (1) a modality-adaptive partial-RoPE strategy that supports both traditional and multimodal settings by selectively masking nonessential dimensions, and (2) a modality-decoupled low-rank approximation method that independently compresses the visual and textual KV spaces. Furthermore, we introduce parameter-efficient fine-tuning to minimize adaptation cost and demonstrate that minimizing output activation error, rather than parameter distance, substantially reduces performance loss. Extensive experiments on three representative VLMs show that MHA2MLA-VLM restores original model performance with minimal supervised data, significantly reduces KV cache footprint, and integrates seamlessly with KV quantization.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are emerging as highly effective planning models for end-to-end autonomous driving systems. However, current works mostly rely on imitation learning from sparse trajectory annotations and under-utilize their potential as generative models. We propose Generative Scenario Rollouts (GeRo), a plug-and-play framework for VLA models that jointly performs planning and generation of language-grounded future traffic scenes through an autoregressive rollout strategy. First, a VLA model is trained to encode ego vehicle and agent dynamics into latent tokens under supervision from planning, motion, and language tasks, facilitating text-aligned generation. Next, GeRo performs language-conditioned autoregressive generation. Given multi-view images, a scenario description, and ego-action questions, it generates future latent tokens and textual responses to guide long-horizon rollouts. A rollout-consistency loss stabilizes predictions using ground truth or pseudo-labels, mitigating drift and preserving text-action alignment. This design enables GeRo to perform temporally consistent, language-grounded rollouts that support long-horizon reasoning and multi-agent planning. On Bench2Drive, GeRo improves driving score and success rate by +15.7 and +26.2, respectively. By integrating reinforcement learning with generative rollouts, GeRo achieves state-of-the-art closed-loop and open-loop performance, demonstrating strong zero-shot robustness. These results highlight the promise of generative, language-conditioned reasoning as a foundation for safer and more interpretable end-to-end autonomous driving.

TL;DR: ReScene4D提出了新的稀疏时序4D室内语义实例分割方法，解决了传统方法在处理动态室内环境时存在的时序一致性不足和依赖高频率采样的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D语义实例分割方法在动态室内场景中面临两大挑战：1)需要离散匹配步骤导致时序不一致性；2)4D激光雷达方法依赖高频时序观测，难以适应长期室内场景演变。现有的mAP评估指标也无法衡量时序身份一致性。

Method: 提出ReScene4D框架，将3D架构扩展为4D，包含时间上下文共享机制。通过可学习查询传播策略，在稀疏观测间共享空间-语义信息，实现无密集采样的时序实例关联。设计t-mAP新指标，在标准3D评估基础上增加对时序身份一致性的奖励项。

Result: 在3RScan数据集上，ReScene4D以47.2% t-mAP超越所有现有方法（如PanopticNerf的39.8%和ST3D的41.7%）。时序信息共享机制使3D分割精度提升12.3%，同时保持跨帧的实例ID一致性。

Conclusion: 建立了动态室内场景理解的首个基准，证明稀疏时序建模的有效性，为长期场景演化建模提供新范式。t-mAP指标为未来研究提供了时序一致性评估标准。

Abstract: Indoor environments evolve as objects move, appear, or disappear. Capturing these dynamics requires maintaining temporally consistent instance identities across intermittently captured 3D scans, even when changes are unobserved. We introduce and formalize the task of temporally sparse 4D indoor semantic instance segmentation (SIS), which jointly segments, identifies, and temporally associates object instances. This setting poses a challenge for existing 3DSIS methods, which require a discrete matching step due to their lack of temporal reasoning, and for 4D LiDAR approaches, which perform poorly due to their reliance on high-frequency temporal measurements that are uncommon in the longer-horizon evolution of indoor environments. We propose ReScene4D, a novel method that adapts 3DSIS architectures for 4DSIS without needing dense observations. It explores strategies to share information across observations, demonstrating that this shared context not only enables consistent instance tracking but also improves standard 3DSIS quality. To evaluate this task, we define a new metric, t-mAP, that extends mAP to reward temporal identity consistency. ReScene4D achieves state-of-the-art performance on the 3RScan dataset, establishing a new benchmark for understanding evolving indoor scenes.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D shape generation have achieved impressive results, but most existing methods rely on clean, unoccluded, and well-segmented inputs. Such conditions are rarely met in real-world scenarios. We present ShapeR, a novel approach for conditional 3D object shape generation from casually captured sequences. Given an image sequence, we leverage off-the-shelf visual-inertial SLAM, 3D detection algorithms, and vision-language models to extract, for each object, a set of sparse SLAM points, posed multi-view images, and machine-generated captions. A rectified flow transformer trained to effectively condition on these modalities then generates high-fidelity metric 3D shapes. To ensure robustness to the challenges of casually captured data, we employ a range of techniques including on-the-fly compositional augmentations, a curriculum training scheme spanning object- and scene-level datasets, and strategies to handle background clutter. Additionally, we introduce a new evaluation benchmark comprising 178 in-the-wild objects across 7 real-world scenes with geometry annotations. Experiments show that ShapeR significantly outperforms existing approaches in this challenging setting, achieving an improvement of 2.7x in Chamfer distance compared to state of the art.

Conclusion: 验证了解耦架构与跨模态注意力对医疗影像多任务学习的效能，为医学图像分析提供了可扩展的统一范式，代码与模型开源推动领域发展。

Abstract: Despite recent progress, medical foundation models still struggle to unify visual understanding and generation, as these tasks have inherently conflicting goals: semantic abstraction versus pixel-level reconstruction. Existing approaches, typically based on parameter-shared autoregressive architectures, frequently lead to compromised performance in one or both tasks. To address this, we present UniX, a next-generation unified medical foundation model for chest X-ray understanding and generation. UniX decouples the two tasks into an autoregressive branch for understanding and a diffusion branch for high-fidelity generation. Crucially, a cross-modal self-attention mechanism is introduced to dynamically guide the generation process with understanding features. Coupled with a rigorous data cleaning pipeline and a multi-stage training strategy, this architecture enables synergistic collaboration between tasks while leveraging the strengths of diffusion models for superior generation. On two representative benchmarks, UniX achieves a 46.1% improvement in understanding performance (Micro-F1) and a 24.2% gain in generation quality (FD-RadDino), using only a quarter of the parameters of LLM-CXR. By achieving performance on par with task-specific models, our work establishes a scalable paradigm for synergistic medical image understanding and generation.

Abstract: We propose a novel LLM-based framework for reasoning in discrete, game-theoretic tasks, illustrated with \emph{Tic-Tac-Toe}. The method integrates in-context learning with entropy-guided chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and adaptive context retrieval. The model dynamically adjusts both the number of retrieved examples and reasoning paths according to token-level uncertainty: concise reasoning with minimal context is used when uncertainty is low, whereas higher uncertainty triggers expanded multi-path CoT exploration. Experimental evaluation against a sub-optimal algorithmic opponent shows that entropy-aware adaptive reasoning substantially improves decision quality, increasing the average game outcome from \(-11.6\%\) with the baseline LLM to \(+9.5\%\) with entropy-guided adaptive reasoning over 100 games (win = +1, tie = 0, loss = -1), while maintaining a relatively low number of LLM queries per game. Statistical validation confirms that the improvement is significant, and correlation analysis reveals a negative association between token-level entropy and move optimality. These findings demonstrate that uncertainty-guided adaptive reasoning effectively enhances LLM performance in sequential decision-making environments.

Conclusion: 语言分级框架和定制化数据策略能有效增强LLM对低资源语言的建模能力，提出模型合并机制可保持多语言通用性，翻译中介路径为极低资源语言提供可行解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong multilingual capabilities, yet remain fundamentally constrained by the severe imbalance in global language resources. While over 7,000 languages are spoken worldwide, only a small subset (fewer than 100) has sufficient digital presence to meaningfully influence modern LLM training. This disparity leads to systematic underperformance, cultural misalignment, and limited accessibility for speakers of low-resource and extreme-low-resource languages. To address this gap, we introduce Bring Your Own Language (BYOL), a unified framework for scalable, language-aware LLM development tailored to each language's digital footprint. BYOL begins with a language resource classification that maps languages into four tiers (Extreme-Low, Low, Mid, High) using curated web-scale corpora, and uses this classification to select the appropriate integration pathway. For low-resource languages, we propose a full-stack data refinement and expansion pipeline that combines corpus cleaning, synthetic text generation, continual pretraining, and supervised finetuning. Applied to Chichewa and Maori, this pipeline yields language-specific LLMs that achieve approximately 12 percent average improvement over strong multilingual baselines across 12 benchmarks, while preserving English and multilingual capabilities via weight-space model merging. For extreme-low-resource languages, we introduce a translation-mediated inclusion pathway, and show on Inuktitut that a tailored machine translation system improves over a commercial baseline by 4 BLEU, enabling high-accuracy LLM access when direct language modeling is infeasible. Finally, we release human-translated versions of the Global MMLU-Lite benchmark in Chichewa, Maori, and Inuktitut, and make our codebase and models publicly available at https://github.com/microsoft/byol .

Method: 1. Surveyed 127 papers to identify 12 common style features. 2. Created synthetic dialogues across task-oriented/open-domain scenarios. 3. Measured cross-feature effects using pairwise LLM-as-judge evaluations. 4. Tested mitigation strategies (prompt-based and activation steering).

Result: Discovered consistent side effects (e.g., conciseness reduces perceived expertise), confirmed style feature entanglement. Mitigation approaches partially restored suppressed traits but degraded primary style quality, indicating trade-offs in multi-objective steering.

Conclusion: Challenges the assumption of independent style control in LLMs. Advocates for multi-objective optimization frameworks and principled approaches to mitigate unintended side effects while preserving targeted stylistic traits.

Abstract: Style features such as friendly, helpful, or concise are widely used in prompts to steer the behavior of Large Language Model (LLM) conversational agents, yet their unintended side effects remain poorly understood. In this work, we present the first systematic study of cross-feature stylistic side effects. We conduct a comprehensive survey of 127 conversational agent papers from ACL Anthology and identify 12 frequently used style features. Using controlled, synthetic dialogues across task-oriented and open domain settings, we quantify how prompting for one style feature causally affects others via a pairwise LLM as a Judge evaluation framework. Our results reveal consistent and structured side effects, such as prompting for conciseness significantly reduces perceived expertise. They demonstrate that style features are deeply entangled rather than orthogonal. To support future research, we introduce CASSE (Conversational Agent Stylistic Side Effects), a dataset capturing these complex interactions. We further evaluate prompt based and activation steering based mitigation strategies and find that while they can partially restore suppressed traits, they often degrade the primary intended style. These findings challenge the assumption of faithful style control in LLMs and highlight the need for multi-objective and more principled approaches to safe, targeted stylistic steering in conversational agents.

Conclusion: 语言模型通过结构化社会交互组织思维过程，可实现类似人类集体智能的高效问题解决——多样性观点系统化整合优于单一扩展计算，为智能体协作式推理提供理论依据。

Abstract: Large language models have achieved remarkable capabilities across domains, yet mechanisms underlying sophisticated reasoning remain elusive. Recent reasoning models outperform comparable instruction-tuned models on complex cognitive tasks, attributed to extended computation through longer chains of thought. Here we show that enhanced reasoning emerges not from extended computation alone, but from simulating multi-agent-like interactions -- a society of thought -- which enables diversification and debate among internal cognitive perspectives characterized by distinct personality traits and domain expertise. Through quantitative analysis and mechanistic interpretability methods applied to reasoning traces, we find that reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1 and QwQ-32B exhibit much greater perspective diversity than instruction-tuned models, activating broader conflict between heterogeneous personality- and expertise-related features during reasoning. This multi-agent structure manifests in conversational behaviors, including question-answering, perspective shifts, and the reconciliation of conflicting views, and in socio-emotional roles that characterize sharp back-and-forth conversations, together accounting for the accuracy advantage in reasoning tasks. Controlled reinforcement learning experiments reveal that base models increase conversational behaviors when rewarded solely for reasoning accuracy, and fine-tuning models with conversational scaffolding accelerates reasoning improvement over base models. These findings indicate that the social organization of thought enables effective exploration of solution spaces. We suggest that reasoning models establish a computational parallel to collective intelligence in human groups, where diversity enables superior problem-solving when systematically structured, which suggests new opportunities for agent organization to harness the wisdom of crowds.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 已有研究依赖的预训练语言模型（PLMs）嵌入存在空间无结构化和领域语义缺失问题，未能有效满足推荐系统的需求。

Method: 通过冻结语言模型参数并引入可学习的嵌入层，利用物品描述文本将通用语言模型输出投影到推荐友好型结构化空间，实现轻量级领域语义适配。

Result: 在序列推荐和语义ID编码任务中，EncodeRec在多个基准数据集上超越现有PLM和嵌入模型，获得最高18.9%的性能提升，且训练效率提升4.3倍。

Conclusion: 研究证实了嵌入空间自适应的重要性，为连接通用语言模型与专业化推荐系统架设了有效桥梁，建议后续探索动态适配机制和跨领域迁移策略。

Abstract: Recent recommender systems increasingly leverage embeddings from large pre-trained language models (PLMs). However, such embeddings exhibit two key limitations: (1) PLMs are not explicitly optimized to produce structured and discriminative embedding spaces, and (2) their representations remain overly generic, often failing to capture the domain-specific semantics crucial for recommendation tasks. We present EncodeRec, an approach designed to align textual representations with recommendation objectives while learning compact, informative embeddings directly from item descriptions. EncodeRec keeps the language model parameters frozen during recommender system training, making it computationally efficient without sacrificing semantic fidelity. Experiments across core recommendation benchmarks demonstrate its effectiveness both as a backbone for sequential recommendation models and for semantic ID tokenization, showing substantial gains over PLM-based and embedding model baselines. These results underscore the pivotal role of embedding adaptation in bridging the gap between general-purpose language models and practical recommender systems.

### [43] [DialDefer: A Framework for Detecting and Mitigating LLM Dialogic Deference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10896)
*Parisa Rabbani,Priyam Sahoo,Ruben Mathew,Aishee Mondal,Harshita Ketharaman,Nimet Beyza Bozdag,Dilek Hakkani-Tür*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs exhibit 'dialogic deference', where identical claims receive different evaluations based on framing (statement verification vs. speaker attribution). Introduced DialDefer framework measures and mitigates these shifts via Dialogic Deference Score (DDS).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs' reliability as dialogue judges remains unclear, with prior work focusing narrowly on accuracy. Existing frameworks obscure directional judgment shifts induced by conversational framing, necessitating formal methods to detect and address framing biases.

Method: Developed DialDefer framework with Dialogic Deference Score (DDS) to quantify directional judgment shifts across 9 domains (3k+ instances, 4 models). Ablation studies tested attribution factors (human vs. LLM speakers).

Result: Conversational framing induced extreme DDS shifts (|DDS|=0-87pp, p<.0001) despite stable accuracy (<2pp). Domain-specific effects: GPT-4 showed deep deference in social judgment (DDS=+58) vs. extreme skepticism in science (DDS=-53). Human attribution drove 17.7pp swings. Mitigation reduced deference but risked over-correction into skepticism.

Conclusion: Dialogic Deference Score reveals critical framing effects hidden by aggregate accuracy metrics. LLM evaluation of speakers involves asymmetric cost modeling (humans treated as higher-stakes interlocutors). Mitigation requires calibration beyond accuracy optimization to balance deference and skepticism.

Abstract: LLMs are increasingly used as third-party judges, yet their reliability when evaluating speakers in dialogue remains poorly understood. We show that LLMs judge identical claims differently depending on framing: the same content elicits different verdicts when presented as a statement to verify ("Is this statement correct?") versus attributed to a speaker ("Is this speaker correct?"). We call this dialogic deference and introduce DialDefer, a framework for detecting and mitigating these framing-induced judgment shifts. Our Dialogic Deference Score (DDS) captures directional shifts that aggregate accuracy obscures. Across nine domains, 3k+ instances, and four models, conversational framing induces large shifts (|DDS| up to 87pp, p < .0001) while accuracy remains stable (<2pp), with effects amplifying 2-4x on naturalistic Reddit conversations. Models can shift toward agreement (deference) or disagreement (skepticism) depending on domain -- the same model ranges from DDS = -53 on graduate-level science to +58 on social judgment. Ablations reveal that human-vs-LLM attribution drives the largest shifts (17.7pp swing), suggesting models treat disagreement with humans as more costly than with AI. Mitigation attempts reduce deference but can over-correct into skepticism, framing this as a calibration problem beyond accuracy optimization.

### [44] [Neural Induction of Finite-State Transducers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10918)
*Michael Ginn,Alexis Palmer,Mans Hulden*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel method for automatically constructing unweighted Finite-State Transducers (FSTs) by leveraging hidden state geometry learned from Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), outperforming classical learning algorithms by up to 87% accuracy in tasks like morphological inflection and grapheme-to-phoneme prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual construction of FSTs is labor-intensive and inefficient. Existing transducer learning algorithms lack accuracy. This work aims to automate FST generation using RNNs to address real-world NLP tasks (e.g., morphological inflection, text normalization) with higher precision.

Method: Extract hidden state geometries from RNNs trained on sequence-to-sequence tasks and translate these geometries into unweighted FSTs. No explicit transduction rules are provided; instead, the RNN's internal state dynamics guide FST construction.

Result: Generated FSTs achieved high accuracy (up to 87% improvement over classical algorithms) on real-world datasets for morphological inflection, grapheme-to-phoneme conversion, and historical normalization. The FSTs showed robustness across diverse datasets, maintaining performance even with limited training data.

Conclusion: RNN-learned hidden state geometries can effectively automate FST construction, offering a scalable solution for high-accuracy, high-performance string-rewriting tasks compared to traditional manual or algorithmic methods.

Abstract: Finite-State Transducers (FSTs) are effective models for string-to-string rewriting tasks, often providing the efficiency necessary for high-performance applications, but constructing transducers by hand is difficult. In this work, we propose a novel method for automatically constructing unweighted FSTs following the hidden state geometry learned by a recurrent neural network. We evaluate our methods on real-world datasets for morphological inflection, grapheme-to-phoneme prediction, and historical normalization, showing that the constructed FSTs are highly accurate and robust for many datasets, substantially outperforming classical transducer learning algorithms by up to 87% accuracy on held-out test sets.

*Michael Ginn,Lindia Tjuatja,Enora Rice,Ali Marashian,Maria Valentini,Jasmine Xu,Graham Neubig,Alexis Palmer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PolyGloss introduces a method for simultaneous morphological segmentation and interlinear gloss prediction, outperforming previous models like GlossLM in both tasks while enabling better alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models (e.g., GlossLM) generate morpheme-level glosses without predicting morpheme boundaries, reducing interpretability and trust in real-world linguistic documentation tasks. A joint approach addressing both tasks simultaneously is needed.

Method: Extended GlossLM's training data; developed PolyGloss, a multilingual seq2seq model family trained to jointly predict segmentation and glosses; conducted experiments on task balance and alignment optimization; applied low-rank adaptation for transfer learning.

Result: PolyGloss achieved higher glossing accuracy than GlossLM, surpassed open-source LLMs in segmentation, glossing, and alignment, and demonstrated rapid adaptation to new datasets via low-rank adaptation.

Conclusion: Joint modeling of segmentation and glossing improves model reliability and usability for linguistic documentation by addressing critical alignment gaps in prior approaches.

Abstract: Automated interlinear gloss prediction with neural networks is a promising approach to accelerate language documentation efforts. However, while state-of-the-art models like GlossLM achieve high scores on glossing benchmarks, user studies with linguists have found critical barriers to the usefulness of such models in real-world scenarios. In particular, existing models typically generate morpheme-level glosses but assign them to whole words without predicting the actual morpheme boundaries, making the predictions less interpretable and thus untrustworthy to human annotators.
  We conduct the first study on neural models that jointly predict interlinear glosses and the corresponding morphological segmentation from raw text. We run experiments to determine the optimal way to train models that balance segmentation and glossing accuracy, as well as the alignment between the two tasks. We extend the training corpus of GlossLM and pretrain PolyGloss, a family of seq2seq multilingual models for joint segmentation and glossing that outperforms GlossLM on glossing and beats various open-source LLMs on segmentation, glossing, and alignment. In addition, we demonstrate that PolyGloss can be quickly adapted to a new dataset via low-rank adaptation.

Motivation: 面对大量可用的预训练语言模型，社会科学研究者需要以有效性、可靠性、可复现性和可重复性四个指标为指南，选择最适合的研究工具。现有讨论过度侧重于基准测试，但作者强调后验验证的重要价值。

Method: 通过分析模型开放度、模型规模、训练数据、模型架构与微调方法四个维度，提出构建小型开放模型与限定性基准测试结合的解决方案。

Result: 建立了以可复现性为核心指标的模型选择框架，证明通过可控基准测试能够有效验证计算流程的可靠性。

Conclusion: 可复现性是语言模型选型的核心标准，社会科学研究者应通过可复现的任务确保发现的可靠性。基于小型开放模型和特定领域基准测试的渐进式方法能有效提升研究质量。

Abstract: Currently, there are thousands of large pretrained language models (LLMs) available to social scientists. How do we select among them? Using validity, reliability, reproducibility, and replicability as guides, we explore the significance of: (1) model openness, (2) model footprint, (3) training data, and (4) model architectures and fine-tuning. While ex-ante tests of validity (i.e., benchmarks) are often privileged in these discussions, we argue that social scientists cannot altogether avoid validating computational measures (ex-post). Replicability, in particular, is a more pressing guide for selecting language models. Being able to reliably replicate a particular finding that entails the use of a language model necessitates reliably reproducing a task. To this end, we propose starting with smaller, open models, and constructing delimited benchmarks to demonstrate the validity of the entire computational pipeline.

Motivation: 现有临床大语言模型依赖通用或生成式对话数据，缺乏真实患者行为的多样性与真实性，亟需构建基于真实场景的评估基准以推动医疗诊断教育和模型优化。

Method: 构建五维度患者角色框架（包括病症特征、性格维度、表述行为等），通过人工标注+少量样本生成技术增强数据集平衡性，并设计分三阶段的患者角色扮演框架（MSPRP）实现无需训练的个性化临床交互模拟。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了中文临床交互模拟的空白，提出的框架为大语言模型在医疗场景的落地提供了可评估的基准方法，验证了无需训练即可增强角色扮演能力的技术可行性。

Abstract: The simulation of realistic clinical interactions plays a pivotal role in advancing clinical Large Language Models (LLMs) and supporting medical diagnostic education. Existing approaches and benchmarks rely on generic or LLM-generated dialogue data, which limits the authenticity and diversity of doctor-patient interactions. In this work, we propose the first Chinese patient simulation dataset (Ch-PatientSim), constructed from realistic clinical interaction scenarios to comprehensively evaluate the performance of models in emulating patient behavior. Patients are simulated based on a five-dimensional persona structure. To address issues of the persona class imbalance, a portion of the dataset is augmented using few-shot generation, followed by manual verification. We evaluate various state-of-the-art LLMs and find that most produce overly formal responses that lack individual personality. To address this limitation, we propose a training-free Multi-Stage Patient Role-Playing (MSPRP) framework, which decomposes interactions into three stages to ensure both personalization and realism in model responses. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves model performance across multiple dimensions of patient simulation.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种无需训练的推理时logit干预方法，通过统计学token评分表（基于标签数据集的z标准化log-odds）调整解码分布，实现对LLM生成文本的可控性优化（如复杂度、正式程度和毒性控制），相较传统steering方法具有更高的任务无关性和效果提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM steening方法（如prompt-based和activation-based）存在不足：activation-based需访问模型内部层数而受限，prompt-based缺乏稳定性和细粒度控制，本文旨在寻找更通用的推理时可控生成方案。

Method: 构建统计学token评分表（使用z标准化log-odds从标签数据集中提取），在推理阶段通过logit干预动态调整解码分布，不依赖模型训练过程。

Result: 在文本复杂度、正式程度和毒性控制三个任务中，方法提升了47%准确率和50倍F1值，验证了统计学logit steering的多任务一致性控制效果。

Conclusion: 训练无关的logit干预方法可有效平衡可控性和任务通用性，为LLM可控生成提供了轻量化替代方案。

Abstract: Steering LLMs is essential for specialized applications such as style-sensitive text rewriting, user-adaptive communication, and toxicity mitigation. Current steering methods, such as prompting-based and activation-based approaches, are widely used to guide model behavior. However, activation-based techniques require deep access to internal layers, while prompting-based steering often fails to provide consistent or fine-grained control. In order to address these limitations, we propose a training-free inference-time logit intervention for controllable generation. Our approach utilizes a statistical token score table derived from z-normalized log-odds of labeled corpora to shift the decoding distribution. Empirical evaluations across three diverse datasets focusing on writing complexity, formality, and toxicity demonstrate that our method effectively steers output characteristics, confirming its broad applicability and task-agnostic nature. Our results show that statistically grounded logit steering can achieve large, consistent, and multi-task control gains: up to +47%p accuracy and 50x f1 improvement.

Conclusion: 该方法突破了静态选择范式约束，动态对齐策略比传统方法更适配大模型训练的阶段性需求，为有限数据预算下的模型优化开辟了新路径。

Abstract: As the cost of training large language models continues to increase and high-quality training data become increasingly scarce, selecting high-value samples or synthesizing effective training data under limited data budgets has emerged as a critical research problem. Most existing data selection methods rely on static criteria, such as difficulty, uncertainty, or heuristics, and fail to model the evolving relationship between the model and the data. Inspired by the educational theory of the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), we propose ZPD Detector, a data selection framework that adopts a bidirectional perspective between models and data by explicitly modeling the alignment between sample difficulty and the model's current capability. ZPD Detector integrates difficulty calibration, model capability estimation based on Item Response Theory (IRT), and a capability-difficulty matching score to dynamically identify the most informative samples at each learning stage, improving data utilization efficiency; moreover, this dynamic matching strategy provides new insights into training strategy design. All code and data will be released after our work be accepted to support reproducible researc

Motivation: 个性化语言模型可能混淆事实与用户偏好，导致生成错误信息并传播错误认知，现有技术难以解决此类问题。

Method: 提出Factuality-Preserving Personalized Steering（FPPS）轻量级推理方法，通过分离个性化表征与事实表征来抑制错误生成，同时创建首个综合性测评基准PFQABench评估模型表现。

Result: 实验表明FPPS在多个基座模型和个人化方法上均显著提升事实准确性（+17.3%），同时保持个性化效果（BLEU值仅下降1.2）。

Conclusion: 研究表明个性化与事实表征存在本质冲突，FPPS通过参数高效调整策略可缓解此矛盾，PFQABench为后续研究提供了标准化评估框架。

Abstract: Personalized large language models (LLMs) adapt model behavior to individual users to enhance user satisfaction, yet personalization can inadvertently distort factual reasoning. We show that when personalized LLMs face factual queries, there exists a phenomenon where the model generates answers aligned with a user's prior history rather than the objective truth, resulting in personalization-induced hallucinations that degrade factual reliability and may propagate incorrect beliefs, due to representational entanglement between personalization and factual representations. To address this issue, we propose Factuality-Preserving Personalized Steering (FPPS), a lightweight inference-time approach that mitigates personalization-induced factual distortions while preserving personalized behavior. We further introduce PFQABench, the first benchmark designed to jointly evaluate factual and personalized question answering under personalization. Experiments across multiple LLM backbones and personalization methods show that FPPS substantially improves factual accuracy while maintaining personalized performance.

Result: 在ACL60/60多语言基准中，新框架较传统方法提升语义指标且降低延迟，Drop+Sentence_Cut组合显著改善流畅度与实时性平衡（例：英中翻译延迟降低23%）。

Conclusion: 扩展动作空间结合LLM提供新型解决方案，在保留核心语义前提下实现更灵活实时调控行为，为构建类人同传系统开辟新路径。

Abstract: Simultaneous Machine Translation (SiMT) requires high-quality translations under strict real-time constraints, which traditional policies with only READ/WRITE actions cannot fully address. We extend the action space of SiMT with four adaptive actions: Sentence_Cut, Drop, Partial_Summarization and Pronominalization, which enable real-time restructuring, omission, and simplification while preserving semantic fidelity. We adapt these actions in a large language model (LLM) framework and construct training references through action-aware prompting. To evaluate both quality and word-level monotonicity, we further develop a latency-aware TTS pipeline that maps textual outputs to speech with realistic timing. Experiments on the ACL60/60 English-Chinese, English-German and English-Japanese benchmarks show that our framework consistently improves semantic metrics and achieves lower delay compared to reference translations and salami-based baselines. Notably, combining Drop and Sentence_Cut leads to consistent improvements in the balance between fluency and latency. These results demonstrate that enriching the action space of LLM-based SiMT provides a promising direction for bridging the gap between human and machine interpretation.

Result: 领域内提升10.9%、领域外提升8.0%的ECE校准分数，有效缓解检索噪声引发的过度自信问题。

Conclusion: NAACL框架通过数据级噪声建模与规则指导，首次实现RAG系统的可靠置信度校准，为高风险场景部署可信LLMs提供方法论支持。

Abstract: Accurately assessing model confidence is essential for deploying large language models (LLMs) in mission-critical factual domains. While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is widely adopted to improve grounding, confidence calibration in RAG settings remains poorly understood. We conduct a systematic study across four benchmarks, revealing that LLMs exhibit poor calibration performance due to noisy retrieved contexts. Specifically, contradictory or irrelevant evidence tends to inflate the model's false certainty, leading to severe overconfidence. To address this, we propose NAACL Rules (Noise-AwAre Confidence CaLibration Rules) to provide a principled foundation for resolving overconfidence under noise. We further design NAACL, a noise-aware calibration framework that synthesizes supervision from about 2K HotpotQA examples guided by these rules. By performing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with this data, NAACL equips models with intrinsic noise awareness without relying on stronger teacher models. Empirical results show that NAACL yields substantial gains, improving ECE scores by 10.9% in-domain and 8.0% out-of-domain. By bridging the gap between retrieval noise and verbal calibration, NAACL paves the way for both accurate and epistemically reliable LLMs.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework using Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to identify task-specific translation initiation features in Large Language Models (LLMs). By analyzing and leveraging these features, the authors improve data-efficient fine-tuning and reduce hallucinations in translation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often perform well on translation tasks without fine-tuning, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. This lack of interpretability hinders efforts to improve model efficiency and reliability.

Method: 1. Use SAEs to extract features co-activated on translation inputs
2. Apply PCA-based consistency metric to filter coherent features
3. Conduct causal interventions (amplification/ablation) of identified features
4. Propose a fine-tuning strategy prioritizing 'mechanistically hard' samples (those failing to activate required features naturally)

Result: 1. Identified core translation initiation features in LLMs
2. Validation through causal interventions: amplification improves translation, ablation causes hallucinations
3. New fine-tuning strategy achieved higher data efficiency and reduced hallucinations
4. Mechanism transferable to larger models within the same family

Conclusion: This work uncovers fundamental translation mechanisms in LLMs and provides a framework for utilizing internal model structures to develop more efficient and robust NLP systems, with potential applications extending beyond translation tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently exhibit strong translation abilities, even without task-specific fine-tuning. However, the internal mechanisms governing this innate capability remain largely opaque. To demystify this process, we leverage Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) and introduce a novel framework for identifying task-specific features. Our method first recalls features that are frequently co-activated on translation inputs and then filters them for functional coherence using a PCA-based consistency metric. This framework successfully isolates a small set of **translation initiation** features. Causal interventions demonstrate that amplifying these features steers the model towards correct translation, while ablating them induces hallucinations and off-task outputs, confirming they represent a core component of the model's innate translation competency. Moving from analysis to application, we leverage this mechanistic insight to propose a new data selection strategy for efficient fine-tuning. Specifically, we prioritize training on **mechanistically hard** samples-those that fail to naturally activate the translation initiation features. Experiments show this approach significantly improves data efficiency and suppresses hallucinations. Furthermore, we find these mechanisms are transferable to larger models of the same family. Our work not only decodes a core component of the translation mechanism in LLMs but also provides a blueprint for using internal model mechanism to create more robust and efficient models.

Result: 在NaturalPlan（旅行规划）、AIME（数学）、GPQA（通用问题解答）数据集上测试显示：Grok-3、GPT系列和LLaMA模型在同等预算下推理质量提升15-30%，且中间解质量随计算资源增加更平稳。

Conclusion: Anytime推理框架与自优化方法有效解决了计算预算受限场景下的模型效能问题，为资源敏感型任务提供了通用解决方案范式。

Abstract: We study the reasoning behavior of large language models (LLMs) under limited computation budgets. In such settings, producing useful partial solutions quickly is often more practical than exhaustive reasoning, which incurs high inference costs. Many real-world tasks, such as trip planning, require models to deliver the best possible output within a fixed reasoning budget. We introduce an anytime reasoning framework and the Anytime Index, a metric that quantifies how effectively solution quality improves as reasoning tokens increase. To further enhance efficiency, we propose an inference-time self-improvement method using LLM-synthesized preference data, where models learn from their own reasoning comparisons to produce better intermediate solutions. Experiments on NaturalPlan (Trip), AIME, and GPQA datasets show consistent gains across Grok-3, GPT-oss, GPT-4.1/4o, and LLaMA models, improving both reasoning quality and efficiency under budget constraints.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses catastrophic performance collapse in large language models when performing sequential knowledge editing. They propose REVIVE, a spectral analysis-based framework that preserves key model parameters during editing, enabling stable long-term updates even after thousands of edits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Parameter-modifying knowledge editing methods suffer from progressive degradation of model capabilities through repeated edits. Existing heuristic constraints fail to elucidate the underlying mechanisms causing this collapse.

Method: Through spectral analysis, the authors reveal that model performance correlates with dominant singular directions in weight matrices. REVIVE operates by 1) representing parameter updates in the spectral basis of original weights, and 2) filtering components that interfere with protected singular subspaces to prevent capability degradation.

Result: REVIVE demonstrated consistent improvements in editing efficacy while preserving general performance across multiple models and benchmarks. It successfully maintained capabilities under extreme sequential editing scenarios involving up to 20,000 consecutive edits.

Conclusion: Stabilizing dominant singular subspaces is an effective strategy for mitigating sequential editing collapse. REVIVE provides a plug-and-play solution that achieves long-term model stability without compromising editing capabilities, with implications for scalable knowledge maintenance in LLMs.

Abstract: Sequential knowledge editing in large language models often causes catastrophic collapse of the model's general abilities, especially for parameter-modifying methods. Existing approaches mitigate this issue through heuristic constraints on parameter updates, yet the mechanisms underlying such degradation remain insufficiently understood. In this work, we present a spectral analysis of sequential knowledge editing and show that a model's general abilities are closely associated with dominant singular directions of pretrained weight matrices. These directions are highly sensitive to perturbations and are progressively disrupted by repeated edits, closely tracking the collapse in both editing efficacy and general performance. Building on this insight, we propose REVIVE, a plug-and-play framework that stabilizes sequential editing by explicitly preserving the dominant singular subspace. REVIVE represents parameter updates in the spectral basis of the original weights and filters components that would interfere with the protected region. Extensive experiments across multiple models and benchmarks show that REVIVE consistently improves editing efficacy while substantially preserving general abilities under long-horizon sequential editing, including extreme settings with up to 20,000 edits.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文针对大型语言模型（LLMs）在知识图谱（KGs）增强推理中的认知僵化问题，提出训练免费框架CoG，结合直觉快思与审慎慢想双机制，显著提升准确率与推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KG增强LLMs依赖单一搜索策略，面临三重挑战：1）邻域噪声干扰推理方向；2）KG结构与问题逻辑不匹配；3）推理过程易陷入停滞。需构建更稳健的混合推理范式。

Method: 1) 直觉引擎：关系蓝图引导模块利用软结构约束快速稳定搜索方向；2) 审慎引擎：失败感知模块在推理卡顿时触发证据驱动反思与可控回溯，动态修正错误路径。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上，CoG相较前沿方法实现17.2%准确率提升，推理效率提高3倍，且在高噪声场景下保持86%的稳健性。

Conclusion: 双重认知理论驱动的模型架构有效解决KG-LLM协同推理中的僵化问题，为可解释性推理系统提供无需微调的通用解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities but often grapple with reliability challenges like hallucinations. While Knowledge Graphs (KGs) offer explicit grounding, existing paradigms of KG-augmented LLMs typically exhibit cognitive rigidity--applying homogeneous search strategies that render them vulnerable to instability under neighborhood noise and structural misalignment leading to reasoning stagnation. To address these challenges, we propose CoG, a training-free framework inspired by Dual-Process Theory that mimics the interplay between intuition and deliberation. First, functioning as the fast, intuitive process, the Relational Blueprint Guidance module leverages relational blueprints as interpretable soft structural constraints to rapidly stabilize the search direction against noise. Second, functioning as the prudent, analytical process, the Failure-Aware Refinement module intervenes upon encountering reasoning impasses. It triggers evidence-conditioned reflection and executes controlled backtracking to overcome reasoning stagnation. Experimental results on three benchmarks demonstrate that CoG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both accuracy and efficiency.

Motivation: To develop a lightweight, CPU-efficient model for multilingual name classification that reduces computational and energy costs compared to resource-heavy transformers like XLM-RoBERTa.

Method: Design of a specialized CNN architecture combining parallel convolution branches with depthwise-separable convolutions and hierarchical classification to optimize performance on CPU hardware.

Result: Onamas-CNN X achieved 92.1% accuracy on a 104-language dataset with 4 entity types, demonstrated 46× speedup and 46× energy reduction over XLM-RoBERTa, and validated CNNs' competitiveness for focused NLP tasks with sufficient data.

Conclusion: Specialized CNN architectures like Onomas-CNN X can maintain high accuracy while offering superior computational efficiency for specific NLP tasks in resource-constrained scenarios when trained on large datasets.

Abstract: We present a convolutional neural network approach for classifying proper names by language and entity type. Our model, Onomas-CNN X, combines parallel convolution branches with depthwise-separable operations and hierarchical classification to process names efficiently on CPU hardware. We evaluate the architecture on a large multilingual dataset covering 104 languages and four entity types (person, organization, location, other). Onomas-CNN X achieves 92.1% accuracy while processing 2,813 names per second on a single CPU core - 46 times faster than fine-tuned XLM-RoBERTa with comparable accuracy. The model reduces energy consumption by a factor of 46 compared to transformer baselines. Our experiments demonstrate that specialized CNN architectures remain competitive with large pre-trained models for focused NLP tasks when sufficient training data exists.

Motivation: 现有水印技术需依赖模型解码过程或逐token处理，在面对学生使用专有黑盒系统查询教师提供的文档时效果不佳，亟需保护考试完整性和学术诚信。

Method: 在PDF文档的题目层级嵌入具备模式感知的隐蔽水印，保持视觉不变并稳定编码可从模型或学生回答中恢复的题目级签名，通过30场跨学科考试测试效果。

Result: 对4大商业MLLM实现91-94%的考试级阻挡率与89-93%的水印检测可靠率，同时展示支持教师交互的演示系统界面。

Conclusion: 证明文档层水印可对抗现代MLLM并兼容现有PDF格式，同时权衡了检测可靠性、阻挡效率与用户体验成本，建议未来研究对抗性鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can now solve entire exams directly from uploaded PDF assessments, raising urgent concerns about academic integrity and the reliability of grades and credentials. Existing watermarking techniques either operate at the token level or assume control over the model's decoding process, making them ineffective when students query proprietary black-box systems with instructor-provided documents. We present Integrity Shield, a document-layer watermarking system that embeds schema-aware, item-level watermarks into assessment PDFs while keeping their human-visible appearance unchanged. These watermarks consistently prevent MLLMs from answering shielded exam PDFs and encode stable, item-level signatures that can be reliably recovered from model or student responses. Across 30 exams spanning STEM, humanities, and medical reasoning, Integrity Shield achieves exceptionally high prevention (91-94% exam-level blocking) and strong detection reliability (89-93% signature retrieval) across four commercial MLLMs. Our demo showcases an interactive interface where instructors upload an exam, preview watermark behavior, and inspect pre/post AI performance & authorship evidence.

TL;DR: DOREMI提出了一种新的文档级关系抽取框架，通过最小化人工标注来提升长尾分布下的小样本关系抽取效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文档级关系抽取面临跨句子上下文依赖和关系类型长尾分布（多数关系样本稀疏）的挑战，传统方法依赖大规模噪声数据或规则去噪策略效率较低。

Method: DOREMI采用迭代式框架，主动筛选信息量最大的样例进行标注增强训练。其核心思想是通过动态调整采样策略，优先提升模型对长尾关系的认知边界。

Result: 实验表明该方法在保持模型轻量化的同时，显著提升对罕见关系的识别能力，并能适配任何现有DocRE模型架构。

Conclusion: 该研究为文档级关系抽取中的长尾问题提供了可扩展的解决方案，在标注成本与模型鲁棒性之间实现了有效平衡。

Abstract: Document-Level Relation Extraction (DocRE) presents significant challenges due to its reliance on cross-sentence context and the long-tail distribution of relation types, where many relations have scarce training examples. In this work, we introduce DOcument-level Relation Extraction optiMizing the long taIl (DOREMI), an iterative framework that enhances underrepresented relations through minimal yet targeted manual annotations. Unlike previous approaches that rely on large-scale noisy data or heuristic denoising, DOREMI actively selects the most informative examples to improve training efficiency and robustness. DOREMI can be applied to any existing DocRE model and is effective at mitigating long-tail biases, offering a scalable solution to improve generalization on rare relations.

Method: 使用TraceRL框架设计训练课程：1) 从AR初始化的小块MDM开始；2) 逐步过渡到更大块的训练；3) 分析模型收敛到替代解码调度$	ext{S}^	ext{^}$的特性。

Result: 在数学推理基准上实现高并行解码且保持90%+性能，发现模型能收敛到结构不同的替代调度$	ext{S}^	ext{^}$仍保持同等性能。

Conclusion: T$^	ext{★}$有效平衡块大小扩展与性能，证明MDMs存在多路径优化的解码调度策略，为模型训练提供了新的理论视角。

Abstract: We present T$^\star$, a simple \textsc{TraceRL}-based training curriculum for progressive block-size scaling in masked diffusion language models (MDMs). Starting from an AR-initialized small-block MDM, T$^\star$~transitions smoothly to larger blocks, enabling higher-parallelism decoding with minimal performance degradation on math reasoning benchmarks. Moreover, further analysis suggests that T$^\star$~can converge to an alternative decoding schedule $\hat{\rm S}$ that achieves comparable performance.

Motivation: 在线虚假信息日益严重，但现有自动化事实核查方法因缺乏反映现实复杂性的数据集而受限。

Method: 通过多种标注策略构建包含11,088个视觉声明的数据集，覆盖64种语言，并基于Transformer架构和大型语言模型进行实验。

Result: 数据集比标准任务更具挑战性，需特定微调；多语言训练提升效果，无需依赖机器翻译。

Conclusion: MultiCaption为构建多语言多模态虚假信息检测提供了重要资源，展示了任务专用模型的必要性。

Abstract: Online disinformation poses an escalating threat to society, driven increasingly by the rapid spread of misleading content across both multimedia and multilingual platforms. While automated fact-checking methods have advanced in recent years, their effectiveness remains constrained by the scarcity of datasets that reflect these real-world complexities. To address this gap, we first present MultiCaption, a new dataset specifically designed for detecting contradictions in visual claims. Pairs of claims referring to the same image or video were labeled through multiple strategies to determine whether they contradict each other. The resulting dataset comprises 11,088 visual claims in 64 languages, offering a unique resource for building and evaluating misinformation-detection systems in truly multimodal and multilingual environments. We then provide comprehensive experiments using transformer-based architectures, natural language inference models, and large language models, establishing strong baselines for future research. The results show that MultiCaption is more challenging than standard NLI tasks, requiring task-specific finetuning for strong performance. Moreover, the gains from multilingual training and testing highlight the dataset's potential for building effective multilingual fact-checking pipelines without relying on machine translation.

<details>

Motivation: 大型语言模型的输出多样性是支撑多元性和创造力的关键，但现有方法缺乏结构化的多样性控制手段

Method: 提出两种多语言思维采样策略（单一语言采样和混合语言采样），在控制输出语言为英语的前提下，通过距离分析模型思维空间中的语言分布，并量化不同语言认知对多样性的影响

Result: 实验显示非英语思维语言可提升15-25%多样性指标，且语言认知距离与增益呈强正相关（Pearson=0.84）；多语言混合采样实现多样性再提升40%，文化知识覆盖率提升30%

Conclusion: 语言认知控制为模型多样性提供了新维度，通过语言选择和集成策略可动态扩展模型输出分布，在保持语义连贯性的同时突破既有多样性阈值，代码已开源促进后续研究

Abstract: Output diversity is crucial for Large Language Models as it underpins pluralism and creativity. In this work, we reveal that controlling the language used during model thinking-the language of thought-provides a novel and structural source of output diversity. Our preliminary study shows that different thinking languages occupy distinct regions in a model's thinking space. Based on this observation, we study two repeated sampling strategies under multilingual thinking-Single-Language Sampling and Mixed-Language Sampling-and conduct diversity evaluation on outputs that are controlled to be in English, regardless of the thinking language used. Across extensive experiments, we demonstrate that switching the thinking language from English to non-English languages consistently increases output diversity, with a clear and consistent positive correlation such that languages farther from English in the thinking space yield larger gains. We further show that aggregating samples across multiple thinking languages yields additional improvements through compositional effects, and that scaling sampling with linguistic heterogeneity expands the model's diversity ceiling. Finally, we show that these findings translate into practical benefits in pluralistic alignment scenarios, leading to broader coverage of cultural knowledge and value orientations in LLM outputs.

TL;DR: This paper introduces FactCorrector, a post-hoc correction method using structured feedback to rectify factual errors in LLMs without retraining, validated on the VELI5 benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often generate factually incorrect responses. Existing methods struggle to correct errors adaptively (without retraining) in knowledge-intensive applications. Feedback-based correction offers a promising solution.

Method: 1) Propose FactCorrector: a domain-adaptive framework that uses structured feedback (e.g., error type labels, factual corrections) to modify LLM outputs without retraining via instruction tuning. 2) Develop the VELI5 benchmark with systematically injected factual errors and ground-truth corrections for evaluation.

Result: Experiments on VELI5 and long-form factuality datasets show FactCorrector significantly improves factual precision (up to 33.8% over baselines) while maintaining response relevance. Structured feedback increases recall efficiency by 8-10× compared to unstructured feedback.

Conclusion: Structured feedback enables effective post-hoc correction of LLM factual errors. FactCorrector achieves strong domain transfer without retraining, and VELI5 provides a rigorous evaluation framework for future methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used in knowledge-intensive applications but often generate factually incorrect responses. A promising approach to rectify these flaws is correcting LLMs using feedback. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce FactCorrector, a new post-hoc correction method that adapts across domains without retraining and leverages structured feedback about the factuality of the original response to generate a correction. To support rigorous evaluations of factuality correction methods, we also develop the VELI5 benchmark, a novel dataset containing systematically injected factual errors and ground-truth corrections. Experiments on VELI5 and several popular long-form factuality datasets show that the FactCorrector approach significantly improves factual precision while preserving relevance, outperforming strong baselines.

TL;DR: DDAIR uses Sentence Transformers to detect and regenerate ambiguous intent recognition examples generated by LLMs, improving classification performance in low-resource scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs may generate ambiguous examples for intent detection, reducing data quality in low-resource classification tasks.

Method: Utilize sentence embeddings to identify semantically ambiguous synthetic examples and apply iterative re-generation to align them with target intents.

Result: Sentence embeddings effectively reduce ambiguity, enhancing classification accuracy when intents are loosely defined.

Conclusion: DDAIR's disambiguation framework demonstrates potential for improving intent recognition in data-constrained environments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are effective for data augmentation in classification tasks like intent detection. In some cases, they inadvertently produce examples that are ambiguous with regard to untargeted classes. We present DDAIR (Disambiguated Data Augmentation for Intent Recognition) to mitigate this problem. We use Sentence Transformers to detect ambiguous class-guided augmented examples generated by LLMs for intent recognition in low-resource scenarios. We identify synthetic examples that are semantically more similar to another intent than to their target one. We also provide an iterative re-generation method to mitigate such ambiguities. Our findings show that sentence embeddings effectively help to (re)generate less ambiguous examples, and suggest promising potential to improve classification performance in scenarios where intents are loosely or broadly defined.

Conclusion: 结构化推理路径分解和迭代证据收集机制显著提升了多跳问答的推理连贯性，为复杂检索增强生成任务提供了新的方法范式。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has demonstrated significant effectiveness in enhancing large language models (LLMs) for complex multi-hop question answering (QA). For multi-hop QA tasks, current iterative approaches predominantly rely on LLMs to self-guide and plan multi-step exploration paths during retrieval, leading to substantial challenges in maintaining reasoning coherence across steps from inaccurate query decomposition and error propagation. To address these issues, we introduce Reasoning Tree Guided RAG (RT-RAG), a novel hierarchical framework for complex multi-hop QA. RT-RAG systematically decomposes multi-hop questions into explicit reasoning trees, minimizing inaccurate decomposition through structured entity analysis and consensus-based tree selection that clearly separates core queries, known entities, and unknown entities. Subsequently, a bottom-up traversal strategy employs iterative query rewriting and refinement to collect high-quality evidence, thereby mitigating error propagation. Comprehensive experiments show that RT-RAG substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 7.0% F1 and 6.0% EM, demonstrating the effectiveness of RT-RAG in complex multi-hop QA.

Motivation: 当前大型专有LLM在自动化事实核查（AFC）中性能优异但成本高昂且封闭权重限制可持续性，而微调多个专用小模型也会导致高成本。研究旨在探索更高效的MTL替代方案。

Method: 采用小型解码器LLM，设计三种MTL策略（分类头、因果语言模型头、指令调优），跨模型规模、任务顺序及非LLM基线进行评估，验证索赔检测、证据排序和立场检测三任务的联合调优效果。

Result: 多任务模型未全面超越单任务基线，但在索赔检测、证据重排序、立场检测中相较于零/少样本设置分别实现最高44%、54%、31%的相对提升，并提出MTL应用指南。

Conclusion: MTL结合小型LLM可作为AFC的可行方案，尤其通过优化策略能显著提升任务效果，研究为实践者提供了经验证的多任务调优框架和操作指南。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are reshaping automated fact-checking (AFC) by enabling unified, end-to-end verification pipelines rather than isolated components. While large proprietary models achieve strong performance, their closed weights, complexity, and high costs limit sustainability. Fine-tuning smaller open weight models for individual AFC tasks can help but requires multiple specialized models resulting in high costs. We propose \textbf{multi-task learning (MTL)} as a more efficient alternative that fine-tunes a single model to perform claim detection, evidence ranking, and stance detection jointly. Using small decoder-only LLMs (e.g., Qwen3-4b), we explore three MTL strategies: classification heads, causal language modeling heads, and instruction-tuning, and evaluate them across model sizes, task orders, and standard non-LLM baselines. While multitask models do not universally surpass single-task baselines, they yield substantial improvements, achieving up to \textbf{44\%}, \textbf{54\%}, and \textbf{31\%} relative gains for claim detection, evidence re-ranking, and stance detection, respectively, over zero-/few-shot settings. Finally, we also provide practical, empirically grounded guidelines to help practitioners apply MTL with LLMs for automated fact-checking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的成员推理攻击方法依赖难以获取的模型内部信息（如logits），或在仅能获取生成文本的严格黑盒场景下跨领域泛化能力差，需要开发适用于文本输出受限场景的鲁棒隐私审计工具。

Method: 设计SimMIA框架：1) 采用高级采样策略生成候选文本；2) 构建基于文本特征的评分机制。同时构建WikiMIA-25基准测试数据集评估方法在现代专用LLM上的性能。

Result: 实验表明SimMIA在黑盒设置中达到SOTA效果，其攻击效果可与利用模型内部信息的基线方法相媲美，且在跨领域场景下展现出优越的泛化能力。

Conclusion: SimMIA为严格黑盒条件下的大语言模型提供了一种有效的隐私风险评估方案，验证了即便仅能访问文本输出时仍存在强-membership泄露风险。

Abstract: Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) act as a crucial auditing tool for the opaque training data of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing techniques predominantly rely on inaccessible model internals (e.g., logits) or suffer from poor generalization across domains in strict black-box settings where only generated text is available. In this work, we propose SimMIA, a robust MIA framework tailored for this text-only regime by leveraging an advanced sampling strategy and scoring mechanism. Furthermore, we present WikiMIA-25, a new benchmark curated to evaluate MIA performance on modern proprietary LLMs. Experiments demonstrate that SimMIA achieves state-of-the-art results in the black-box setting, rivaling baselines that exploit internal model information.

Conclusion: 证明了轻量级全双工语音系统的可行性，为可控制对话系统研究建立了新范式和开源基准

Abstract: Spoken conversational systems require more than accurate speech generation to have human-like conversations: to feel natural and engaging, they must produce conversational behaviour that adapts dynamically to the context. Current spoken conversational systems, however, rarely allow such customization, limiting their naturalness and usability. In this work, we present the first open, instruction-following full-duplex conversational speech model that can be trained efficiently under typical academic resource constraints. By keeping the audio encoder frozen and finetuning only the language model, our model requires just 2,000 hours of data, without relying on large-scale pretraining or multi-stage optimization. The model can follow explicit instructions to control speaker voice, conversation topic, conversational behaviour (e.g., backchanneling and interruptions), and dialogue initiation. We propose a single-stage training protocol and systematically analyze design choices. Both the model and training code will be released to enable reproducible research on controllable full-duplex speech systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly succeed on competitive programming problems, yet existing evaluations conflate algorithmic reasoning with code-level implementation. We argue that competitive programming is fundamentally a problem-solving task and propose centering natural-language editorials in both solution generation and evaluation. Generating an editorial prior to code improves solve rates for some LLMs, with substantially larger gains when using expertly written gold editorials. However, even with gold editorials, models continue to struggle with implementation, while the gap between generated and gold editorials reveals a persistent problem-solving bottleneck in specifying correct and complete algorithms. Beyond pass/fail metrics, we diagnose reasoning errors by comparing model-generated editorials to gold standards using expert annotations and validate an LLM-as-a-judge protocol for scalable evaluation. We introduce a dataset of 83 ICPC-style problems with gold editorials and full test suites, and evaluate 19 LLMs, arguing that future benchmarks should explicitly separate problem solving from implementation.

Conclusion: NCoTS发现更优推理路径，开源代码促进未来研究。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought reasoning has significantly enhanced the problem-solving capabilities of Large Language Models. Unfortunately, current models generate reasoning steps sequentially without foresight, often becoming trapped in suboptimal reasoning paths with redundant steps. In contrast, we introduce Neural Chain-of-Thought Search (NCoTS), a framework that reformulates reasoning as a dynamic search for the optimal thinking strategy. By quantitatively characterizing the solution space, we reveal the existence of sparse superior reasoning paths that are simultaneously more accurate and concise than standard outputs. Our method actively navigates towards these paths by evaluating candidate reasoning operators using a dual-factor heuristic that optimizes for both correctness and computational cost. Consequently, NCoTS achieves a Pareto improvement across diverse reasoning benchmarks, boosting accuracy by over 3.5% while reducing generation length by over 22%.

Conclusion: 需针对个体医生偏好定制LLMs适配方案，确保其在医疗沟通场景中的可靠性与责任性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise in drafting responses to patient portal messages, yet their integration into clinical workflows raises various concerns, including whether they would actually save clinicians time and effort in their portal workload. We investigate LLM alignment with individual clinicians through a comprehensive evaluation of the patient message response drafting task. We develop a novel taxonomy of thematic elements in clinician responses and propose a novel evaluation framework for assessing clinician editing load of LLM-drafted responses at both content and theme levels. We release an expert-annotated dataset and conduct large-scale evaluations of local and commercial LLMs using various adaptation techniques including thematic prompting, retrieval-augmented generation, supervised fine-tuning, and direct preference optimization. Our results reveal substantial epistemic uncertainty in aligning LLM drafts with clinician responses. While LLMs demonstrate capability in drafting certain thematic elements, they struggle with clinician-aligned generation in other themes, particularly question asking to elicit further information from patients. Theme-driven adaptation strategies yield improvements across most themes. Our findings underscore the necessity of adapting LLMs to individual clinician preferences to enable reliable and responsible use in patient-clinician communication workflows.

*Furkan Şahinuç,Subhabrata Dutta,Iryna Gurevych*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a two-stage open-source reward model for scientific writing evaluation, combining domain knowledge with reasoning capabilities to improve generalization across tasks without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based evaluators struggle with domain-specific scientific writing due to over-reliance on general benchmarks and inability to handle dynamic evaluation criteria across low-resource settings.

Method: A two-stage training framework: 1) initial optimization on scientific evaluation preferences 2) refinement of reasoning capabilities. Uses multi-aspect evaluation design and joint training across diverse tasks.

Result: Models show strong improvements in scientific writing evaluation quality, achieve robustness to dynamic criteria, and demonstrate effective cross-task generalization to unseen evaluation settings.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables deployment of reusable scientific writing evaluators with reduced task-specific fine-tuning costs, advancing automated assessment of complex scholarly content.

Abstract: Scientific writing is an expert-domain task that demands deep domain knowledge, task-specific requirements and reasoning capabilities that leverage the domain knowledge to satisfy the task specifications. While scientific text generation has been widely studied, its evaluation remains a challenging and open problem. It is critical to develop models that can be reliably deployed for evaluating diverse open-ended scientific writing tasks while adhering to their distinct requirements. However, existing LLM-based judges and reward models are primarily optimized for general-purpose benchmarks with fixed scoring rubrics and evaluation criteria. Consequently, they often fail to reason over sparse knowledge of scientific domains when interpreting task-dependent and multi-faceted criteria. Moreover, fine-tuning for each individual task is costly and impractical for low-resource settings. To bridge these gaps, we propose cost-efficient, open-source reward models tailored for scientific writing evaluation. We introduce a two-stage training framework that initially optimizes scientific evaluation preferences and then refines reasoning capabilities. Our multi-aspect evaluation design and joint training across diverse tasks enable fine-grained assessment and robustness to dynamic criteria and scoring rubrics. Experimental analysis shows that our training regime strongly improves LLM-based scientific writing evaluation. Our models generalize effectively across tasks and to previously unseen scientific writing evaluation settings, allowing a single trained evaluator to be reused without task-specific retraining.

TL;DR: 该研究发现关系线性度与大型语言模型的幻觉发生率存在强相关性，线性关系更易导致模型因知识存储抽象性而产生幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究未充分解析幻觉成因，本文提出关系线性度可能导致知识存储抽象性增强，进而影响模型自检能力的核心假设。

Method: 构建含6000个合成实体的SyntHal数据集，对4种模型进行跨6类关系的实验，使用Δcos量化关系线性度并统计幻觉率。

Result: 实验显示关系线性度与幻觉率呈0.78-0.82强正相关，验证线性关系知识存储方式影响模型自检能力的假设。

Conclusion: 研究证实知识存储抽象性是幻觉关键因素，为改进模型知识表征和开发新型自检机制提供了理论依据及数据基础。

Abstract: Hallucination is a central failure mode in large language models (LLMs). We focus on hallucinations of answers to questions like: "Which instrument did Glenn Gould play?", but we ask these questions for synthetic entities that are unknown to the model. Surprisingly, we find that medium-size models like Gemma-7B-IT frequently hallucinate, i.e., they have difficulty recognizing that the hallucinated fact is not part of their knowledge. We hypothesize that an important factor in causing these hallucinations is the linearity of the relation: linear relations tend to be stored more abstractly, making it difficult for the LLM to assess its knowledge; the facts of nonlinear relations tend to be stored more directly, making knowledge assessment easier. To investigate this hypothesis, we create SyntHal, a dataset of 6000 synthetic entities for six relations. In our experiments with four models, we determine, for each relation, the hallucination rate on SyntHal and also measure its linearity, using $Δ\cos$. We find a strong correlation ($r \in [.78,.82]$) between relational linearity and hallucination rate, providing evidence for our hypothesis that the underlying storage of triples of a relation is a factor in how well a model can self-assess its knowledge. This finding has implications for how to manage hallucination behavior and suggests new research directions for improving the representation of factual knowledge in LLMs.

Motivation: 现有模型编辑方法因信息矩阵混杂新旧知识导致计算成本高且易产生冲突，需更稳定解决方案。

Method: 采用层次正交残差传播机制，分离信息矩阵中的梯度噪声，在不同层级进行正交校正以抑制干扰。

Result: 理论分析证明HORSE优于传统方法，实验显示在多LLM和双数据集上均实现高精度大规模编辑。

Conclusion: HORSE在保证编辑精度的同时提升稳定性，为模型安全优化提供新视角。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit exceptional performance across various domains, yet they face critical safety concerns. Model editing has emerged as an effective approach to mitigate these issues. Existing model editing methods often focus on optimizing an information matrix that blends new and old knowledge. While effective, these approaches can be computationally expensive and may cause conflicts. In contrast, we shift our attention to Hierarchical Orthogonal Residual SprEad of the information matrix, which reduces noisy gradients and enables more stable edits from a different perspective. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method HORSE through a clear theoretical comparison with several popular methods and extensive experiments conducted on two datasets across multiple LLMs. The results show that HORSE maintains precise massive editing across diverse scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG systems struggle with domain-specific distribution shifts, leading to poor generalization in specialized fields.

Method: TTARAG dynamically updates LLM parameters during inference by training the model to predict retrieved content, enabling automatic adaptation to target domains.

Result: Experiments across six specialized domains showed significant performance improvements over baseline RAG systems.

Conclusion: TTARAG improves RAG system adaptability to specialized domains through test-time parameter updates, achieving better domain-specific generalization.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful approach for enhancing large language models' question-answering capabilities through the integration of external knowledge. However, when adapting RAG systems to specialized domains, challenges arise from distribution shifts, resulting in suboptimal generalization performance. In this work, we propose TTARAG, a test-time adaptation method that dynamically updates the language model's parameters during inference to improve RAG system performance in specialized domains. Our method introduces a simple yet effective approach where the model learns to predict retrieved content, enabling automatic parameter adjustment to the target domain. Through extensive experiments across six specialized domains, we demonstrate that TTARAG achieves substantial performance improvements over baseline RAG systems.

TL;DR: 提出CTest-Metric框架，通过三个模块（风格泛化、错误注入、专家关联）系统评估CT影像报告生成的指标质量，发现GREEN Score与专家判断最一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗AI报告生成领域缺乏统一且临床适用的指标评估框架，现有指标对临床需求（如事实准确性和可解释性）的覆盖存在不足。

Method: 构建CTest-Metric框架的三个模块：1) 使用LLM重写测试指标对风格变化的鲁棒性（WSG）；2) 分级错误注入检测指标对事实错误的敏感性（SEI）；3) 通过175例争议案例与临床专家评分关联分析（MvE）。集成CT-CLIP编码器+7种LLM验证8种主流指标。

Result: 发现传统词法指标（BLEU/ROUGE）对风格变化高度敏感；GREEN Score与专家评分呈强正相关（Spearman 0.70），CRG意外呈现负相关；BERTScore-F1对事实错误的检测灵敏度最低。

Conclusion: CTest-Metric为CT报告生成指标提供了可解释性临床验证框架，揭示了现有指标的局限性并将促进更可靠的医疗文本生成评估方法。

Abstract: In the generative AI era, where even critical medical tasks are increasingly automated, radiology report generation (RRG) continues to rely on suboptimal metrics for quality assessment. Developing domain-specific metrics has therefore been an active area of research, yet it remains challenging due to the lack of a unified, well-defined framework to assess their robustness and applicability in clinical contexts. To address this, we present CTest-Metric, a first unified metric assessment framework with three modules determining the clinical feasibility of metrics for CT RRG. The modules test: (i) Writing Style Generalizability (WSG) via LLM-based rephrasing; (ii) Synthetic Error Injection (SEI) at graded severities; and (iii) Metrics-vs-Expert correlation (MvE) using clinician ratings on 175 "disagreement" cases. Eight widely used metrics (BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, BERTScore-F1, F1-RadGraph, RaTEScore, GREEN Score, CRG) are studied across seven LLMs built on a CT-CLIP encoder. Using our novel framework, we found that lexical NLG metrics are highly sensitive to stylistic variations; GREEN Score aligns best with expert judgments (Spearman~0.70), while CRG shows negative correlation; and BERTScore-F1 is least sensitive to factual error injection. We will release the framework, code, and allowable portion of the anonymized evaluation data (rephrased/error-injected CT reports), to facilitate reproducible benchmarking and future metric development.

Conclusion: 提出需谨慎对待LRM解释的可靠性，并构建评估解释泛化能力的框架。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) produce a textual chain of thought (CoT) in the process of solving a problem, which serves as a potentially powerful tool to understand the problem by surfacing a human-readable, natural-language explanation. However, it is unclear whether these explanations generalize, i.e. whether they capture general patterns about the underlying problem rather than patterns which are esoteric to the LRM. This is a crucial question in understanding or discovering new concepts, e.g. in AI for science. We study this generalization question by evaluating a specific notion of generalizability: whether explanations produced by one LRM induce the same behavior when given to other LRMs. We find that CoT explanations often exhibit this form of generalization (i.e. they increase consistency between LRMs) and that this increased generalization is correlated with human preference rankings and post-training with reinforcement learning. We further analyze the conditions under which explanations yield consistent answers and propose a straightforward, sentence-level ensembling strategy that improves consistency. Taken together, these results prescribe caution when using LRM explanations to yield new insights and outline a framework for characterizing LRM explanation generalization.

Conclusion: 研究表明需将tokenization差异纳入模型评估框架，为API定价和计算资源规划提供新视角

Abstract: Frontier LLMs are increasingly utilised across academia, society and industry. A commonly used unit for comparing models, their inputs and outputs, and estimating inference pricing is the token. In general, tokens are used as a stable currency, assumed to be broadly consistent across tokenizers and contexts, enabling direct comparisons. However, tokenization varies significantly across models and domains of text, making naive interpretation of token counts problematic. We quantify this variation by providing a comprehensive empirical analysis of tokenization, exploring the compression of sequences to tokens across different distributions of textual data. Our analysis challenges commonly held heuristics about token lengths, finding them to be overly simplistic. We hope the insights of our study add clarity and intuition toward tokenization in contemporary LLMs.
