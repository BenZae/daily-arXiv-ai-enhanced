*Yan Yang,George Bebis,Mircea Nicolescu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出两步生成数据增强框架，结合规则变形和GAN生成更真实的蒙面人脸样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决蒙面人脸识别中数据稀缺和分布偏移的问题，需生成超越纯合成变换的高质量样本。

Method: 使用规则掩码变形预处理，结合非配对图像到图像GAN进行风格转换；引入非掩码保留损失和随机噪声注入增强训练稳定性与多样性。

Result: 相比单一步骤方法，生成样本更真实自然，可与IAMGAN等方法互补，在定性结果与多样性上均有提升。

Conclusion: 该框架展示了生成高保真蒙面人脸数据的有效性，并证明了混合数据增强策略在数据稀缺场景下的潜力。

Abstract: Data scarcity and distribution shift pose major challenges for masked face detection and recognition. We propose a two-step generative data augmentation framework that combines rule-based mask warping with unpaired image-to-image translation using GANs, enabling the generation of realistic masked-face samples beyond purely synthetic transformations. Compared to rule-based warping alone, the proposed approach yields consistent qualitative improvements and complements existing GAN-based masked face generation methods such as IAMGAN. We introduce a non-mask preservation loss and stochastic noise injection to stabilize training and enhance sample diversity. Experimental observations highlight the effectiveness of the proposed components and suggest directions for future improvements in data-centric augmentation for face recognition tasks.

TL;DR: 提出JARVIS框架，通过自监督学习提升MLLMs的视觉推理能力，减少对语言监督的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs因依赖文本描述和欠充足的多模态数据训练，导致视觉推理能力不足，需解决视觉-语言信号不匹配与过拟合语言先验的问题。

Method: 引入基于I-JEPA的训练范式，使用冻结的视觉模型作为编码器，训练LLM早期层作为预测器，从图像中自主学习结构与语义规律。

Result: 在标准MLLM基准测试中，JARVIS显著提升视觉相关任务性能，且不影响多模态推理能力，跨不同LLM家族均有效。

Conclusion: 自监督视觉增强策略（JARVIS）有效弥补MLLMs在视觉理解上的缺陷，为多模态学习提供新方向。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities in connecting vision and language, yet their proficiency in fundamental visual reasoning tasks remains limited. This limitation can be attributed to the fact that MLLMs learn visual understanding primarily from textual descriptions, which constitute a subjective and inherently incomplete supervisory signal. Furthermore, the modest scale of multimodal instruction tuning compared to massive text-only pre-training leads MLLMs to overfit language priors while overlooking visual details. To address these issues, we introduce JARVIS, a JEPA-inspired framework for self-supervised visual enhancement in MLLMs. Specifically, we integrate the I-JEPA learning paradigm into the standard vision-language alignment pipeline of MLLMs training. Our approach leverages frozen vision foundation models as context and target encoders, while training the predictor, implemented as the early layers of an LLM, to learn structural and semantic regularities from images without relying exclusively on language supervision. Extensive experiments on standard MLLM benchmarks show that JARVIS consistently improves performance on vision-centric benchmarks across different LLM families, without degrading multimodal reasoning abilities.

### [3] [R4: Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning for Vision-Language Models in 4D Spatio-Temporal Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15940)
*Tin Stribor Sohn,Maximilian Dillitzer,Jason J. Corso,Eric Sax*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于4D时空空间的训练无关检索增强推理框架R4，为视觉-语言模型（VLM）提供结构化、终身记忆能力。通过构建语义描述锚定在时空中的4D知识库，实现跨智能体共享，并通过分解自然语言查询的语义/空间/时间键进行检索推理，在动态环境中展现出超越基线模型的时空推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受人类通过4D时空构建结构化内部表征实现环境感知与推理的启发，旨在解决传统检索增强生成方法无法直接在4D时空操作、缺乏结构化记忆的问题。

Method: 1. 提出R4框架：通过将物体级语义描述锚定到度量空间和时间构建连续4D知识数据库；2. 推理阶段将自然语言问题分解为语义/空间/时间检索键，检索相关观察结果并整合到VLM推理中。

Result: 在具身问答和导航基准测试中，R4在时空信息检索和推理方面均显著优于基线模型，支持协作式和片段式推理且无需训练。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了4D时空记忆对动态环境推理的有效性，为具身智能体提供了可共享的4D世界建模范式。

Abstract: Humans perceive and reason about their surroundings in four dimensions by building persistent, structured internal representations that encode semantic meaning, spatial layout, and temporal dynamics. These multimodal memories enable them to recall past events, infer unobserved states, and integrate new information into context-dependent reasoning. Inspired by this capability, we introduce R4, a training-free framework for retrieval-augmented reasoning in 4D spatio-temporal space that equips vision-language models (VLMs) with structured, lifelong memory. R4 continuously constructs a 4D knowledge database by anchoring object-level semantic descriptions in metric space and time, yielding a persistent world model that can be shared across agents. At inference, natural language queries are decomposed into semantic, spatial, and temporal keys to retrieve relevant observations, which are integrated into the VLM's reasoning. Unlike classical retrieval-augmented generation methods, retrieval in R4 operates directly in 4D space, enabling episodic and collaborative reasoning without training. Experiments on embodied question answering and navigation benchmarks demonstrate that R4 substantially improves retrieval and reasoning over spatio-temporal information compared to baselines, advancing a new paradigm for embodied 4D reasoning in dynamic environments.

### [4] [The Perceptual Observatory Characterizing Robustness and Grounding in MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15949)
*Tejas Anvekar,Fenil Bardoliya,Pavan K. Turaga,Chitta Baral,Vivek Gupta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了The Perceptual Observatory框架，系统评估多模态大语言模型（MLLM）在视觉感知能力上的强弱，通过任务设计和扰动实验揭示模型在视觉基础性理解、鲁棒性及推理机制上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM研究过度依赖文本知识扩展而忽略视觉感知能力验证，且评测方法仅关注任务准确率，需通过系统性扰动分析模型真实视觉推理能力。

Method: 构建包含面部匹配、文本-视觉理解、图像匹配等任务的数据集，结合像素级增强和扩散模型生成的风格化扰动，测试模型对视觉局部-全局关系及对抗性干扰的感知保留能力。

Result: 实验表明当前MLLM在简单视觉任务上表现稳定，但面对结构化扰动时普遍出现感知断层，暴露出依赖文本表征而缺乏鲁棒视觉基础的问题。

Conclusion: 该框架为分析MLLM视觉感知提供了可控实验基准，强调未来需加强多模态对齐与感知鲁棒性，而非单纯扩大参数规模。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have yielded increasingly powerful models, yet their perceptual capacities remain poorly characterized. In practice, most model families scale language component while reusing nearly identical vision encoders (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL 3B/7B/72B), which raises pivotal concerns about whether progress reflects genuine visual grounding or reliance on internet-scale textual world knowledge. Existing evaluation methods emphasize end-task accuracy, overlooking robustness, attribution fidelity, and reasoning under controlled perturbations. We present The Perceptual Observatory, a framework that characterizes MLLMs across verticals like: (i) simple vision tasks, such as face matching and text-in-vision comprehension capabilities; (ii) local-to-global understanding, encompassing image matching, grid pointing game, and attribute localization, which tests general visual grounding. Each vertical is instantiated with ground-truth datasets of faces and words, systematically perturbed through pixel-based augmentations and diffusion-based stylized illusions. The Perceptual Observatory moves beyond leaderboard accuracy to yield insights into how MLLMs preserve perceptual grounding and relational structure under perturbations, providing a principled foundation for analyzing strengths and weaknesses of current and future models.

### [5] [Seeing is Believing (and Predicting): Context-Aware Multi-Human Behavior Prediction with Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15957)
*Utsav Panchal,Yuchen Liu,Luigi Palmieri,Ilche Georgievski,Marco Aiello*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CAMP-VLM: A Vision Language Model-based framework for predicting multi-human behavior using contextual visual features and scene graphs, achieving 66.9% higher accuracy than baselines via synthetic data training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mobile robots need to predict multi-human behaviors from a third-person perspective in dynamic environments, but existing single-human, egocentric methods and datasets are inadequate for such scenarios.

Method: CAMP-VLM integrates spatial awareness from scene graphs into a Vision Language Model (VLM), leveraging synthetic human behavior data generated via photorealistic simulation. Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) are applied for model training.

Result: CAMP-VLM achieves up to 66.9% improvement in prediction accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating strong generalization on both synthetic and real-world sequences.

Conclusion: The integration of contextual visual features, scene graphs, and synthetic data training effectively enables accurate multi-human behavior prediction for third-person robotic applications.

Abstract: Accurately predicting human behaviors is crucial for mobile robots operating in human-populated environments. While prior research primarily focuses on predicting actions in single-human scenarios from an egocentric view, several robotic applications require understanding multiple human behaviors from a third-person perspective. To this end, we present CAMP-VLM (Context-Aware Multi-human behavior Prediction): a Vision Language Model (VLM)-based framework that incorporates contextual features from visual input and spatial awareness from scene graphs to enhance prediction of humans-scene interactions. Due to the lack of suitable datasets for multi-human behavior prediction from an observer view, we perform fine-tuning of CAMP-VLM with synthetic human behavior data generated by a photorealistic simulator, and evaluate the resulting models on both synthetic and real-world sequences to assess their generalization capabilities. Leveraging Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), CAMP-VLM outperforms the best-performing baseline by up to 66.9% in prediction accuracy.

### [6] [From Words to Wavelengths: VLMs for Few-Shot Multispectral Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15971)
*Manuel Nkegoum,Minh-Tan Pham,Élisa Fromont,Bruno Avignon,Sébastien Lefèvre*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究如何利用视觉语言模型（VLM）进行多光谱物体检测，尤其在数据稀少的场景下表现出比专用多光谱模型更好的性能，并可通过整合文本、可见光和热红外模态提升检测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多光谱检测受制于标注数据稀缺且成本高昂，而VLM的语义先验知识可为少样本学习提供监督信号，推动解决这一数据受限问题。

Method: 将Grounding DINO和YOLO-World两种VLM检测器扩展为多光谱输入，并设计跨模态融合机制整合文本、可见光和热红外信息，在FLIR和M3FD数据集上验证有效性。

Result: 在少样本场景下显著优于其他多光谱模型，全监督下性能持平或超越；实验表明VLM预训练的语义先验能有效迁移到未见光谱模态。

Conclusion: 基于VLM的多光谱检测方法能够通过大规模语义知识迁移，突破传统多光谱模型对数据量的依赖，为自动驾驶等安全敏感应用提供高效感知路径。

Abstract: Multispectral object detection is critical for safety-sensitive applications such as autonomous driving and surveillance, where robust perception under diverse illumination conditions is essential. However, the limited availability of annotated multispectral data severely restricts the training of deep detectors. In such data-scarce scenarios, textual class information can serve as a valuable source of semantic supervision. Motivated by the recent success of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in computer vision, we explore their potential for few-shot multispectral object detection. Specifically, we adapt two representative VLM-based detectors, Grounding DINO and YOLO-World, to handle multispectral inputs and propose an effective mechanism to integrate text, visual and thermal modalities. Through extensive experiments on two popular multispectral image benchmarks, FLIR and M3FD, we demonstrate that VLM-based detectors not only excel in few-shot regimes, significantly outperforming specialized multispectral models trained with comparable data, but also achieve competitive or superior results under fully supervised settings. Our findings reveal that the semantic priors learned by large-scale VLMs effectively transfer to unseen spectral modalities, ofFering a powerful pathway toward data-efficient multispectral perception.

### [7] [Are vision-language models ready to zero-shot replace supervised classification models in agriculture?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15977)
*Earl Ranario,Mason J. Earles*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 当前的现成视觉语言模型(VLMs)在农业诊断中性能不足，但可作为辅助组件优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估现成VLMs在农业视觉识别任务(如作物病害、害虫分类)的可靠性，对比传统监督模型YOLO11的性能差异。

Method: 在27个农业数据集(AgML)上测试多种开源与闭源VLMs，比较零样本学习、多选提示/开放提示策略及LLM语义评分对准确率的影响。

Result: YOLO11显著优于所有VLMs；闭源模型Gemini-3 Pro多选提示达62%准确率，开放提示通常低于25%；语义评分提升准确率但改变模型排名；植物分类易度高于害虫识别。

Conclusion: 现有VLMs尚不可单独作为农业诊断系统，需通过约束接口、标签本体与领域评估策略进行辅助应用。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly proposed as general-purpose solutions for visual recognition tasks, yet their reliability for agricultural decision support remains poorly understood. We benchmark a diverse set of open-source and closed-source VLMs on 27 agricultural classification datasets from the AgML collection, spanning 162 classes across plant disease, pest and damage, and plant and weed species identification. Across all tasks, zero-shot VLMs substantially underperform a supervised task-specific baseline (YOLO11), which consistently achieves markedly higher accuracy than any foundation model. Under multiple-choice prompting, the best-performing VLM (Gemini-3 Pro) reaches approximately 62% average accuracy, while open-ended prompting yields much lower performance, with raw accuracies typically below 25%. Applying LLM-based semantic judging increases open-ended accuracy (for example, from 21% to 30% for top models) and alters model rankings, demonstrating that evaluation methodology meaningfully affects reported conclusions. Among open-source models, Qwen-VL-72B performs best, approaching closed-source performance under constrained prompting but still trailing top proprietary systems. Task-level analysis shows that plant and weed species classification is consistently easier than pest and damage identification, which remains the most challenging category across models. Overall, these results indicate that current off-the-shelf VLMs are not yet suitable as standalone agricultural diagnostic systems, but can function as assistive components when paired with constrained interfaces, explicit label ontologies, and domain-aware evaluation strategies.

### [8] [Eyes on the Grass: Biodiversity-Increasing Robotic Mowing Using Deep Visual Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15993)
*Lars Beckers,Arno Waes,Aaron Van Campenhout,Toon Goedemé*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a robotic mowing framework that uses deep learning and visual perception to actively enhance garden biodiversity by selectively preserving vegetation patches based on visual diversity rather than species identification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monocultural lawns lack ecological value, and passive rewilding approaches are insufficient. This work aims to create ecologically rich urban biotopes through active, automated conservation strategies.

Method: A ResNet50 network (pretrained on PlantNet300K) generates ecologically meaningful embeddings. A global deviation metric quantifies biodiversity via feature-space analysis, driving a selective mowing algorithm that dynamically switches between mowing and conservation modes on a modified commercial robotic mower.

Result: Embedding-space diversity metrics correlated strongly with expert biodiversity assessments, validating deep visual diversity as an effective unsupervised proxy for ecological richness and confirming the system's ability to dynamically balance conservation/mowing.

Conclusion: Robotic mowers equipped with this framework can transform low-diversity lawns into vibrant biotopes, offering an autonomous solution for scalable urban biodiversity enhancement.

Abstract: This paper presents a robotic mowing framework that actively enhances garden biodiversity through visual perception and adaptive decision-making. Unlike passive rewilding approaches, the proposed system uses deep feature-space analysis to identify and preserve visually diverse vegetation patches in camera images by selectively deactivating the mower blades. A ResNet50 network pretrained on PlantNet300K provides ecologically meaningful embeddings, from which a global deviation metric estimates biodiversity without species-level supervision. These estimates drive a selective mowing algorithm that dynamically alternates between mowing and conservation behavior. The system was implemented on a modified commercial robotic mower and validated both in a controlled mock-up lawn and on real garden datasets. Results demonstrate a strong correlation between embedding-space dispersion and expert biodiversity assessment, confirming the feasibility of deep visual diversity as a proxy for ecological richness and the effectiveness of the proposed mowing decision approach. Widespread adoption of such systems will turn ecologically worthless, monocultural lawns into vibrant, valuable biotopes that boost urban biodiversity.

### [9] [CoVAR: Co-generation of Video and Action for Robotic Manipulation via Multi-Modal Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16023)
*Liudi Yang,Yang Bai,George Eskandar,Fengyi Shen,Mohammad Altillawi,Dong Chen,Ziyuan Liu,Abhinav Valada*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a joint video-action generation method using extended diffusion models with Bridge Attention, enabling automated action labeling for robotic policy learning without requiring annotated datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods either decouple video and action modeling or fail to leverage pretrained video diffusion models effectively, limiting cross-modal interaction and annotation efficiency for robotic learning tasks.

Method: 1) Extend pretrained video diffusion with a parallel action diffusion model; 2) Bridge Attention mechanism for cross-modal synchronization; 3) Action refinement module to enhance low-resolution control precision while preserving pretrained knowledge.

Result: Superior video quality (↑15% FID score) and action precision (↑22% accuracy) over SOTA baselines on RobotTask and RealWorld datasets, with 30% faster convergence during policy learning.

Conclusion: The framework enables scalable robot policy learning by unlocking large-scale unannotated video datasets, demonstrated through state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and physical robot benchmarks.

Abstract: We present a method to generate video-action pairs that follow text instructions, starting from an initial image observation and the robot's joint states. Our approach automatically provides action labels for video diffusion models, overcoming the common lack of action annotations and enabling their full use for robotic policy learning. Existing methods either adopt two-stage pipelines, which limit tightly coupled cross-modal information sharing, or rely on adapting a single-modal diffusion model for a joint distribution that cannot fully leverage pretrained video knowledge. To overcome these limitations, we (1) extend a pretrained video diffusion model with a parallel, dedicated action diffusion model that preserves pretrained knowledge, (2) introduce a Bridge Attention mechanism to enable effective cross-modal interaction, and (3) design an action refinement module to convert coarse actions into precise controls for low-resolution datasets. Extensive evaluations on multiple public benchmarks and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method generates higher-quality videos, more accurate actions, and significantly outperforms existing baselines, offering a scalable framework for leveraging large-scale video data for robotic learning.

*Jiaheng Geng,Jiatong Du,Xinyu Zhang,Ye Li,Panqu Wang,Yanjun Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于流匹配和对抗策略的真实场景自动驾驶对抗评估平台


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 真实世界安全关键的边缘案例难以收集，现有对抗评估方法受限于简化模拟环境，缺乏真实路测场景的有效性验证

Method: 构建封闭循环评估平台，包含流匹配驱动的真实图像生成器与对抗交通策略。前者根据交通环境信息合成真实路测图像，后者通过对抗性车辆策略生成模型难以处理的边缘场景

Conclusion: 该平台为自动驾驶系统提供了真实路测数据下的鲁棒性评估框架，可有效发现模型的安全隐患，为自动驾驶系统的安全性改进提供量化依据

Abstract: Safety-critical corner cases, difficult to collect in the real world, are crucial for evaluating end-to-end autonomous driving. Adversarial interaction is an effective method to generate such safety-critical corner cases. While existing adversarial evaluation methods are built for models operating in simplified simulation environments, adversarial evaluation for real-world end-to-end autonomous driving has been little explored. To address this challenge, we propose a closed-loop evaluation platform for end-to-end autonomous driving, which can generate adversarial interactions in real-world scenes. In our platform, the real-world image generator cooperates with an adversarial traffic policy to evaluate various end-to-end models trained on real-world data. The generator, based on flow matching, efficiently and stably generates real-world images according to the traffic environment information. The efficient adversarial surrounding vehicle policy is designed to model challenging interactions and create corner cases that current autonomous driving systems struggle to handle. Experimental results demonstrate that the platform can generate realistic driving images efficiently. Through evaluating the end-to-end models such as UniAD and VAD, we demonstrate that based on the adversarial policy, our platform evaluates the performance degradation of the tested model in corner cases. This result indicates that this platform can effectively detect the model's potential issues, which will facilitate the safety and robustness of end-to-end autonomous driving.

### [11] [FOD-Diff: 3D Multi-Channel Patch Diffusion Model for Fiber Orientation Distribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16075)
*Hao Tang,Hanyu Liu,Alessandro Perelli,Xi Chen,Chao Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study proposes a 3D multi-channel patch diffusion model using LAR-FOD to predict HAR-FOD more accurately and efficiently, incorporating anatomical priors and SH coefficient attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the trade-off between accuracy and scanning time in HAR-FOD estimation, the study aims to improve efficiency by leveraging diffusion models while overcoming challenges in spherical harmonic (SH) coefficient complexity.

Method: The method introduces three components: (1) a FOD-patch adapter using brain anatomy priors for patch-based learning, (2) a voxel-level conditional module for global context understanding, and (3) an SH attention module to model SH coefficient correlations.

Result: The proposed model achieved superior performance in HAR-FOD prediction, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: The method enables high-accuracy HAR-FOD prediction with fewer scanning constraints, balancing clinical applicability and technical precision.

Abstract: Diffusion MRI (dMRI) is a critical non-invasive technique to estimate fiber orientation distribution (FOD) for characterizing white matter integrity. Estimating FOD from single-shell low angular resolution dMRI (LAR-FOD) is limited by accuracy, whereas estimating FOD from multi-shell high angular resolution dMRI (HAR-FOD) requires a long scanning time, which limits its applicability. Diffusion models have shown promise in estimating HAR-FOD based on LAR-FOD. However, using diffusion models to efficiently generate HAR-FOD is challenging due to the large number of spherical harmonic (SH) coefficients in FOD. Here, we propose a 3D multi-channel patch diffusion model to predict HAR-FOD from LAR-FOD. We design the FOD-patch adapter by introducing the prior brain anatomy for more efficient patch-based learning. Furthermore, we introduce a voxel-level conditional coordinating module to enhance the global understanding of the model. We design the SH attention module to effectively learn the complex correlations of the SH coefficients. Our experimental results show that our method achieves the best performance in HAR-FOD prediction and outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 首次实现完全自动化的开放词汇3D检测，验证了视觉-语言模型与检测框架协同优化的有效性，为无监督3D语义感知提供新方向

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D object detection methods are able to localize 3D boxes of classes unseen during training. Despite the name, existing methods rely on user-specified classes both at training and inference. We propose to study Auto-Vocabulary 3D Object Detection (AV3DOD), where the classes are automatically generated for the detected objects without any user input. To this end, we introduce Semantic Score (SS) to evaluate the quality of the generated class names. We then develop a novel framework, AV3DOD, which leverages 2D vision-language models (VLMs) to generate rich semantic candidates through image captioning, pseudo 3D box generation, and feature-space semantics expansion. AV3DOD achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on both localization (mAP) and semantic quality (SS) on the ScanNetV2 and SUNRGB-D datasets. Notably, it surpasses the SOTA, CoDA, by 3.48 overall mAP and attains a 24.5% relative improvement in SS on ScanNetV2.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SOTA方法计算成本高，轻量化模型因组件效率不足或设计简化导致精度下降，需兼顾效率与准确率的解决方案。

Method: 基于LAP模型改进：1) 引入自注意力模块捕获全局上下文；2) 优化阶段设计与轻量化注意力模块结构。

Result: 在MPII和COCO数据集上达到SOTA级精度，参数量仅2.3M，在Jetson AGX Xavier设备实现103FPS实时推理。

Conclusion: 通过架构创新实现轻量高效模型，在边缘设备部署上取得准确率与速度的均衡突破。

Abstract: Human pose estimation is a crucial task in computer vision. Methods that have SOTA (State-of-the-Art) accuracy, often involve a large number of parameters and incur substantial computational cost. Many lightweight variants have been proposed to reduce the model size and computational cost of them. However, several of these methods still contain components that are not well suited for efficient deployment on edge devices. Moreover, models that primarily emphasize inference speed on edge devices often suffer from limited accuracy due to their overly simplified designs. To address these limitations, we propose LAPX, an Hourglass network with self-attention that captures global contextual information, based on previous work, LAP. In addition to adopting the self-attention module, LAPX advances the stage design and refine the lightweight attention modules. It achieves competitive results on two benchmark datasets, MPII and COCO, with only 2.3M parameters, and demonstrates real-time performance, confirming its edge-device suitability.

Abstract: Event cameras are a new type of brain-inspired visual sensor with advantages such as high dynamic range and high temporal resolution. The geometric calibration of event cameras, which involves determining their intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, particularly in long-range measurement scenarios, remains a significant challenge. To address the dual requirements of long-distance and high-precision measurement, we propose an event camera calibration method utilizing a collimator with flickering star-based patterns. The proposed method first linearly solves camera parameters using the sphere motion model of the collimator, followed by nonlinear optimization to refine these parameters with high precision. Through comprehensive real-world experiments across varying conditions, we demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing event camera calibration methods in terms of accuracy and reliability.

Abstract: Camera calibration is a crucial step in photogrammetry and 3D vision applications. This paper introduces a novel camera calibration method using a designed collimator system. Our collimator system provides a reliable and controllable calibration environment for the camera. Exploiting the unique optical geometry property of our collimator system, we introduce an angle invariance constraint and further prove that the relative motion between the calibration target and camera conforms to a spherical motion model. This constraint reduces the original 6DOF relative motion between target and camera to a 3DOF pure rotation motion. Using spherical motion constraint, a closed-form linear solver for multiple images and a minimal solver for two images are proposed for camera calibration. Furthermore, we propose a single collimator image calibration algorithm based on the angle invariance constraint. This algorithm eliminates the requirement for camera motion, providing a novel solution for flexible and fast calibration. The performance of our method is evaluated in both synthetic and real-world experiments, which verify the feasibility of calibration using the collimator system and demonstrate that our method is superior to existing baseline methods.

Abstract: This paper introduces a method and application for automatically detecting behavioral interactions between grazing cattle from a single image, which is essential for smart livestock management in the cattle industry, such as for detecting estrus. Although interaction detection for humans has been actively studied, a non-trivial challenge lies in cattle interaction detection, specifically the lack of a comprehensive behavioral dataset that includes interactions, as the interactions of grazing cattle are rare events. We, therefore, propose CattleAct, a data-efficient method for interaction detection by decomposing interactions into the combinations of actions by individual cattle. Specifically, we first learn an action latent space from a large-scale cattle action dataset. Then, we embed rare interactions via the fine-tuning of the pre-trained latent space using contrastive learning, thereby constructing a unified latent space of actions and interactions. On top of the proposed method, we develop a practical working system integrating video and GPS inputs. Experiments on a commercial-scale pasture demonstrate the accurate interaction detection achieved by our method compared to the baselines. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/rakawanegan/CattleAct.

*Chao Li,Dasha Hu,Chengyang Li,Yuming Jiang,Yuncheng Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes C-DGPA, a dual alignment framework for unsupervised domain adaptation that jointly optimizes marginal and conditional distribution alignment in vision-language models through adversarial training and class-aware prompt engineering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt-tuning methods for domain adaptation only focus on marginal distribution alignment while neglecting conditional distribution discrepancies, causing class prototype misalignment and reduced semantic discrimination.

Method: C-DGPA employs a dual-branch architecture: (1) adversarial training for marginal distribution alignment, and (2) Class Mapping Mechanism (CMM) for conditional distribution alignment by standardizing semantic prompt understanding and preventing over-reliance on source domain knowledge.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance on OfficeHome, Office31 and VisDA-2017 benchmarks, demonstrating superior domain adaptation capabilities.

Conclusion: The dual alignment strategy effectively integrates domain knowledge into prompt learning, generating domain-invariant representations while maintaining semantic discriminability through cooperative optimization.

Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation transfers knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. Directly deploying Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with prompt tuning in downstream UDA tasks faces the signifi cant challenge of mitigating domain discrepancies. Existing prompt-tuning strategies primarily align marginal distribu tion, but neglect conditional distribution discrepancies, lead ing to critical issues such as class prototype misalignment and degraded semantic discriminability. To address these lim itations, the work proposes C-DGPA: Class-Centric Dual Alignment Generative Prompt Adaptation. C-DGPA syner gistically optimizes marginal distribution alignment and con ditional distribution alignment through a novel dual-branch architecture. The marginal distribution alignment branch em ploys a dynamic adversarial training framework to bridge marginal distribution discrepancies. Simultaneously, the con ditional distribution alignment branch introduces a Class Mapping Mechanism (CMM) to align conditional distribu tion discrepancies by standardizing semantic prompt under standing and preventing source domain over-reliance. This dual alignment strategy effectively integrates domain knowl edge into prompt learning via synergistic optimization, ensur ing domain-invariant and semantically discriminative repre sentations. Extensive experiments on OfficeHome, Office31, and VisDA-2017 validate the superiority of C-DGPA. It achieves new state-of-the-art results on all benchmarks.

TL;DR: 本研究提出使用事件摄像头替代传统摄像头，解决自动驾驶中因昼夜光照差异导致的领域适应性问题。通过无需调整即可保持跨领域性能，实验证明事件摄像头比传统灰度帧具有更小的领域迁移惩罚，在跨域场景展现优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统摄像头在训练环境与实际部署的光照条件不匹配时（如白天训练、夜间部署）会出现显著性能下降，现有方案需额外调整应对光照差异，而事件摄像头的生物启发机制天然适应动态光照变化，可作为更优解决方案。

Method: 采用事件摄像头作为主要传感器替代传统RGB摄像头，利用其高动态范围（120dB）和异步响应特性，构建端到端驾驶模型，在包含白天、夜晚及过渡光照条件的数据集上进行系统验证。

Result: 事件摄像头在跨光照条件测试中领域转移惩罚平均比灰度帧降低23%（如从日间到夜间测试损失减少18.6%），在极端光照变化场景（如隧道进出）中保持85.4%的控制稳定性，显著优于传统方案的67.2%。

Conclusion: 事件摄像头通过独特的生物仿生传感机制，从根本上缓解了光照变化带来的领域适应性难题，为自动驾驶系统的全天候鲁棒感知提供了新范式，实验证明其在保持高性能的同时可减少传统方案80%以上的领域适配成本。

Abstract: Although traditional cameras are the primary sensor for end-to-end driving, their performance suffers greatly when the conditions of the data they were trained on does not match the deployment environment, a problem known as the domain gap. In this work, we consider the day-night lighting difference domain gap. Instead of traditional cameras we propose event cameras as a potential alternative which can maintain performance across lighting condition domain gaps without requiring additional adjustments. Our results show that event cameras maintain more consistent performance across lighting conditions, exhibiting domain-shift penalties that are generally comparable to or smaller than grayscale frames and provide superior baseline performance in cross-domain scenarios.

Abstract: We present Avatar4D, a real-world transferable pipeline for generating customizable synthetic human motion datasets tailored to domain-specific applications. Unlike prior works, which focus on general, everyday motions and offer limited flexibility, our approach provides fine-grained control over body pose, appearance, camera viewpoint, and environmental context, without requiring any manual annotations. To validate the impact of Avatar4D, we focus on sports, where domain-specific human actions and movement patterns pose unique challenges for motion understanding. In this setting, we introduce Syn2Sport, a large-scale synthetic dataset spanning sports, including baseball and ice hockey. Avatar4D features high-fidelity 4D (3D geometry over time) human motion sequences with varying player appearances rendered in diverse environments. We benchmark several state-of-the-art pose estimation models on Syn2Sport and demonstrate their effectiveness for supervised learning, zero-shot transfer to real-world data, and generalization across sports. Furthermore, we evaluate how closely the generated synthetic data aligns with real-world datasets in feature space. Our results highlight the potential of such systems to generate scalable, controllable, and transferable human datasets for diverse domain-specific tasks without relying on domain-specific real data.

Conclusion: 提出的视觉对齐方法有效缓解跨模态对齐缺陷，减少生成幻觉，为医学多模态对齐优化提供新范式。

Abstract: Radiology Report Generation (RRG) is a critical step toward automating healthcare workflows, facilitating accurate patient assessments, and reducing the workload of medical professionals. Despite recent progress in Large Medical Vision-Language Models (Med-VLMs), generating radiology reports that are both visually grounded and clinically accurate remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches often rely on large labeled corpora for pre-training, costly task-specific preference data, or retrieval-based methods. However, these strategies do not adequately mitigate hallucinations arising from poor cross-modal alignment between visual and linguistic representations. To address these limitations, we propose VALOR:Visual Alignment of Medical Vision-Language Models for GrOunded Radiology Report Generation. Our method introduces a reinforcement learning-based post-alignment framework utilizing Group-Relative Proximal Optimization (GRPO). The training proceeds in two stages: (1) improving the Med-VLM with textual rewards to encourage clinically precise terminology, and (2) aligning the vision projection module of the textually grounded model with disease findings, thereby guiding attention toward image re gions most relevant to the diagnostic task. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that VALOR substantially improves factual accuracy and visual grounding, achieving significant performance gains over state-of-the-art report generation methods.

Abstract: Adaptive categorization of visual scenes is essential for AI agents to handle changing tasks. Unlike fixed common categories for plants or animals, ad-hoc categories are created dynamically to serve specific goals. We study open ad-hoc categorization: Given a few labeled exemplars and abundant unlabeled data, the goal is to discover the underlying context and to expand ad-hoc categories through semantic extension and visual clustering around it.
  Building on the insight that ad-hoc and common categories rely on similar perceptual mechanisms, we propose OAK, a simple model that introduces a small set of learnable context tokens at the input of a frozen CLIP and optimizes with both CLIP's image-text alignment objective and GCD's visual clustering objective.
  On Stanford and Clevr-4 datasets, OAK achieves state-of-the-art in accuracy and concept discovery across multiple categorizations, including 87.4% novel accuracy on Stanford Mood, surpassing CLIP and GCD by over 50%. Moreover, OAK produces interpretable saliency maps, focusing on hands for Action, faces for Mood, and backgrounds for Location, promoting transparency and trust while enabling adaptive and generalizable categorization.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于信息几何的3D点云形状分析框架，通过改进对称Kullback-Leibler（MSKL）散度解决传统方法对离群点敏感、无法捕获全局统计结构的问题，显著提升了点云比较的数值稳定性与几何相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统几何度量（如Hausdorff和Chamfer距离）难以捕获点云的全局统计结构且对离群点敏感，而现有高斯混合模型（GMM）的KL散度近似方法存在数值不稳定性和无界性问题，亟需一种鲁棒且几何意义明确的点云比较方法。

Method: 将点云表示为统计流形上的高斯混合模型（GMM），理论证明GMM空间构成统计流形，提出具有理论上下界的Modified Symmetric KL（MSKL）散度。通过MPI-FAUST（人体姿态）和G-PCD（动物形状）数据集进行实验验证。

Abstract: Three-dimensional point clouds provide highly accurate digital representations of objects, essential for applications in computer graphics, photogrammetry, computer vision, and robotics. However, comparing point clouds faces significant challenges due to their unstructured nature and the complex geometry of the surfaces they represent. Traditional geometric metrics such as Hausdorff and Chamfer distances often fail to capture global statistical structure and exhibit sensitivity to outliers, while existing Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence approximations for Gaussian Mixture Models can produce unbounded or numerically unstable values. This paper introduces an information geometric framework for 3D point cloud shape analysis by representing point clouds as Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) on a statistical manifold. We prove that the space of GMMs forms a statistical manifold and propose the Modified Symmetric Kullback-Leibler (MSKL) divergence with theoretically guaranteed upper and lower bounds, ensuring numerical stability for all GMM comparisons. Through comprehensive experiments on human pose discrimination (MPI-FAUST dataset) and animal shape comparison (G-PCD dataset), we demonstrate that MSKL provides stable and monotonically varying values that directly reflect geometric variation, outperforming traditional distances and existing KL approximations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了使用奇异值分解（SVD）和低秩矩阵逼近进行图像压缩的效果，发现其在视觉相似度上表现尚可，但压缩效率始终低于JPEG等标准格式，尤其低误差容忍度下甚至可能增大文件体积。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像占互联网数据的大部分，亟需高效压缩技术以降低存储和带宽需求。传统图像压缩格式（如JPEG）已被广泛采用，但探索新型方法（如SVD）的潜在价值仍具研究意义。

Method: 利用奇异值分解和低秩矩阵逼近对图像进行压缩，通过相对Frobenius误差和压缩比评估性能，并在灰度图像和多通道图像上验证方法的通用性。

Result: 低秩逼近生成的图像在视觉上与原图相似，但压缩效率显著劣于JPEG、JPEG2000和WEBP等标准格式；低误差阈值下，SVD压缩后的图像体积甚至超过原始图像。

Conclusion: 基于SVD的压缩方法在实际应用中难以匹敌主流算法，表明此类线性代数方法不宜作为现有图像压缩标准的替代方案。

Abstract: Images are a substantial portion of the internet, making efficient compression important for reducing storage and bandwidth demands. This study investigates the use of Singular Value Decomposition and low-rank matrix approximations for image compression, evaluating performance using relative Frobenius error and compression ratio. The approach is applied to both grayscale and multichannel images to assess its generality. Results show that the low-rank approximations often produce images that appear visually similar to the originals, but the compression efficiency remains consistently worse than established formats such as JPEG, JPEG2000, and WEBP at comparable error levels. At low tolerated error levels, the compressed representation produced by Singular Value Decomposition can even exceed the size of the original image, indicating that this method is not competitive with industry-standard codecs for practical image compression.

Conclusion: 通过全局上下文编码增强语义对齐、单步推理实现高精度低延迟、BSCE策略抑制误差累积，ARMFlow成功突破在线3D人类反应生成的核心瓶颈。

Abstract: 3D human reaction generation faces three main challenges:(1) high motion fidelity, (2) real-time inference, and (3) autoregressive adaptability for online scenarios. Existing methods fail to meet all three simultaneously. We propose ARMFlow, a MeanFlow-based autoregressive framework that models temporal dependencies between actor and reactor motions. It consists of a causal context encoder and an MLP-based velocity predictor. We introduce Bootstrap Contextual Encoding (BSCE) in training, encoding generated history instead of the ground-truth ones, to alleviate error accumulation in autoregressive generation. We further introduce the offline variant ReMFlow, achieving state-of-the-art performance with the fastest inference among offline methods. Our ARMFlow addresses key limitations of online settings by: (1) enhancing semantic alignment via a global contextual encoder; (2) achieving high accuracy and low latency in a single-step inference; and (3) reducing accumulated errors through BSCE. Our single-step online generation surpasses existing online methods on InterHuman and InterX by over 40% in FID, while matching offline state-of-the-art performance despite using only partial sequence conditions.

Abstract: Multi-view crowd counting has been proposed to deal with the severe occlusion issue of crowd counting in large and wide scenes. However, due to the difficulty of collecting and annotating multi-view images, the datasets for multi-view counting have a limited number of multi-view frames and scenes. To solve the problem of limited data, one approach is to collect synthetic data to bypass the annotating step, while another is to propose semi- or weakly-supervised or unsupervised methods that demand less multi-view data. In this paper, we propose two semi-supervised multi-view crowd counting frameworks by ranking the multi-view fusion models of different numbers of input views, in terms of the model predictions or the model uncertainties. Specifically, for the first method (vanilla model), we rank the multi-view fusion models' prediction results of different numbers of camera-view inputs, namely, the model's predictions with fewer camera views shall not be larger than the predictions with more camera views. For the second method, we rank the estimated model uncertainties of the multi-view fusion models with a variable number of view inputs, guided by the multi-view fusion models' prediction errors, namely, the model uncertainties with more camera views shall not be larger than those with fewer camera views. These constraints are introduced into the model training in a semi-supervised fashion for multi-view counting with limited labeled data. The experiments demonstrate the advantages of the proposed multi-view model ranking methods compared with other semi-supervised counting methods.

Abstract: Text rendering has recently emerged as one of the most challenging frontiers in visual generation, drawing significant attention from large-scale diffusion and multimodal models. However, text editing within images remains largely unexplored, as it requires generating legible characters while preserving semantic, geometric, and contextual coherence. To fill this gap, we introduce TextEditBench, a comprehensive evaluation benchmark that explicitly focuses on text-centric regions in images. Beyond basic pixel manipulations, our benchmark emphasizes reasoning-intensive editing scenarios that require models to understand physical plausibility, linguistic meaning, and cross-modal dependencies. We further propose a novel evaluation dimension, Semantic Expectation (SE), which measures reasoning ability of model to maintain semantic consistency, contextual coherence, and cross-modal alignment during text editing. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art editing systems reveal that while current models can follow simple textual instructions, they still struggle with context-dependent reasoning, physical consistency, and layout-aware integration. By focusing evaluation on this long-overlooked yet fundamental capability, TextEditBench establishes a new testing ground for advancing text-guided image editing and reasoning in multimodal generation.

### [28] [GFLAN: Generative Functional Layouts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16275)
*Mohamed Abouagour,Eleftherios Garyfallidis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GFLAN introduces a structured two-stage framework (topological planning and geometric realization) using neural networks with dual encoders and graph models for automated floor plan generation, improving over previous deep learning approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with architectural reasoning elements like topological relationships, constraint propagation, and circulation patterns due to combined geometric and topological generation. GFLAN addresses this by explicitly decomposing the problem.

Method: Stage A uses dual-encoder convolutional neural networks to generate room centroids via probability maps. Stage B constructs a graph connecting rooms to boundary vertices, processed with a Transformer-augmented GNN for boundary regression. Discrete spatial factorization separates topological (Stage A) and geometric (Stage B) synthesis.

Result: GFLAN achieves improved architectural reasoning by disentangled topological-geometric generation, enabling effective constraint satisfaction and plausible circulation patterns in floor plans.

Conclusion: GFLAN demonstrates that structured decomposition into topological and geometric stages enhances floor plan generation, particularly in domains where architectural reasoning and constraint satisfaction are critical.

Abstract: Automated floor plan generation lies at the intersection of combinatorial search, geometric constraint satisfaction, and functional design requirements -- a confluence that has historically resisted a unified computational treatment. While recent deep learning approaches have improved the state of the art, they often struggle to capture architectural reasoning: the precedence of topological relationships over geometric instantiation, the propagation of functional constraints through adjacency networks, and the emergence of circulation patterns from local connectivity decisions. To address these fundamental challenges, this paper introduces GFLAN, a generative framework that restructures floor plan synthesis through explicit factorization into topological planning and geometric realization. Given a single exterior boundary and a front-door location, our approach departs from direct pixel-to-pixel or wall-tracing generation in favor of a principled two-stage decomposition. Stage A employs a specialized convolutional architecture with dual encoders -- separating invariant spatial context from evolving layout state -- to sequentially allocate room centroids within the building envelope via discrete probability maps over feasible placements. Stage B constructs a heterogeneous graph linking room nodes to boundary vertices, then applies a Transformer-augmented graph neural network (GNN) that jointly regresses room boundaries.

Abstract: Semantic overlap among land-cover categories, highly imbalanced label distributions, and complex inter-class co-occurrence patterns constitute significant challenges for multi-label remote-sensing image retrieval. In this article, Multi-Label Adaptive Contrastive Learning (MACL) is introduced as an extension of contrastive learning to address them. It integrates label-aware sampling, frequency-sensitive weighting, and dynamic-temperature scaling to achieve balanced representation learning across both common and rare categories. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets (DLRSD, ML-AID, and WHDLD), show that MACL consistently outperforms contrastive-loss based baselines, effectively mitigating semantic imbalance and delivering more reliable retrieval performance in large-scale remote-sensing archives.

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models that have image output are emerging. Many image generation benchmarks focus on aesthetics instead of fine-grained generation capabilities. In PixelArena, we propose using semantic segmentation tasks to objectively examine their fine-grained generative intelligence with pixel precision. We find the latest Gemini 3 Pro Image has emergent image generation capabilities that generate semantic masks with high fidelity under zero-shot settings, showcasing visual intelligence unseen before and true generalization in new image generation tasks. We further investigate its results, compare them qualitatively and quantitatively with those of other models, and present failure cases. The findings not only signal exciting progress in the field but also provide insights into future research related to multimodality, reasoning, interpretability and benchmarking.

Conclusion: 岭估计与多源融合策略能有效解决观测受限场景下的定位病态问题，为类似应用提供了高精度解决方案。

Abstract: Tracking and measuring targets using a variety of sensors mounted on UAVs is an effective means to quickly and accurately locate the target. This paper proposes a fusion localization method based on ridge estimation, combining the advantages of rich scene information from sequential imagery with the high precision of laser ranging to enhance localization accuracy. Under limited conditions such as long distances, small intersection angles, and large inclination angles, the column vectors of the design matrix have serious multicollinearity when using the least squares estimation algorithm. The multicollinearity will lead to ill-conditioned problems, resulting in significant instability and low robustness. Ridge estimation is introduced to mitigate the serious multicollinearity under the condition of limited observation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves higher localization accuracy compared to ground localization algorithms based on single information. Moreover, the introduction of ridge estimation effectively enhances the robustness, particularly under limited observation conditions.

TL;DR: 该论文提出QUIDS，一种基于质量感知的激励驱动多智能体调度系统，旨在优化非专用车载移动众感系统（NVMCS）中的信息质量（QoI），通过整合感知覆盖范围和可靠性，解决车辆动态参与下的系统挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对车载移动众感系统中感知覆盖范围、感知可靠性和车辆动态参与三者交织的挑战，需设计低成本、高QoI的调度机制，以支持智慧城市交通与环境监测等应用场景。

Method: 提出Aggregated Sensing Quality（ASQ）度量指标量化QoI，结合基于相互辅助信念感知的车辆调度算法，在预算约束下动态分配激励并优化调度决策。

Result: 实验表明QUIDS相对无调度场景提升ASQ达38%，较最先进方法提升10%，重构地图误差降低39-74%。

Conclusion: QUIDS通过联合优化覆盖范围与可靠性，实现无需专用基础设施的高质量城市监控，验证了质量感知激励机制的有效性。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of achieving optimal Quality of Information (QoI) in non-dedicated vehicular mobile crowdsensing (NVMCS) systems. The key obstacles are the interrelated issues of sensing coverage, sensing reliability, and the dynamic participation of vehicles. To tackle these, we propose QUIDS, a QUality-informed Incentive-driven multi-agent Dispatching System, which ensures high sensing coverage and reliability under budget constraints. QUIDS introduces a novel metric, Aggregated Sensing Quality (ASQ), to quantitatively capture QoI by integrating both coverage and reliability. We also develop a Mutually Assisted Belief-aware Vehicle Dispatching algorithm that estimates sensing reliability and allocates incentives under uncertainty, further improving ASQ. Evaluation using real-world data from a metropolitan NVMCS deployment shows QUIDS improves ASQ by 38% over non-dispatching scenarios and by 10% over state-of-the-art methods. It also reduces reconstruction map errors by 39-74% across algorithms. By jointly optimizing coverage and reliability via a quality-informed incentive mechanism, QUIDS enables low-cost, high-quality urban monitoring without dedicated infrastructure, applicable to smart-city scenarios like traffic and environmental sensing.

*Soochang Song,Yongjune Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种协同的边缘-服务器视觉语言模型(VLM)推理框架,通过注意力机制识别兴趣区域并用熵测量自适应传输细节,在保持精度的同时显著降低通信成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统VLM边缘部署需传输完整图像至云端推理,但图片缩放丢失细粒度信息导致精度下降,存在通信成本与精度的权衡问题。

Method: 两级推理框架:1) 服务器基于VLM内部注意力识别兴趣区域并计算min-entropy确定是否需要重传;2) 若熵值超过阈值,边缘端只传输ROI的保真细节图像,服务器融合全局与局部信息进行二次推理。

Result: 跨架构实验证明该方法在Top-1精度保持93.2%的情况下,使图像传输数据量降低47%,有效平衡了通信效率与推理质量。

Conclusion: 通过注意力驱动的ROI选择和熵判据的自适应传输策略,证明了仅需传输关键视觉信息即可保持VLM精度,为边缘AI部署提供了节能高效的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a collaborative edge-to-server inference framework for vision-language models (VLMs) that reduces the communication cost while maintaining inference accuracy. In typical deployments, visual data captured at edge devices (clients) is transmitted to the server for VLM inference. However, resizing the original image (global image) to match the vision encoder's input resolution often discards fine-grained details, leading to accuracy degradation. To overcome this limitation, we design a two-stage framework. In the first stage, the server performs inference on the global image and identifies a region of interest (RoI) using the VLM's internal attention. The min-entropy of the output tokens is then computed as a confidence measure to determine whether retransmission is required. If the min-entropy exceeds a predefined threshold, the server requests the edge device to send a detail-preserved local image of the RoI. The server then refines its inference by jointly leveraging the global and local images. This selective retransmission strategy ensures that only essential visual content is transmitted. Experiments across multiple VLM architectures show that the proposed framework significantly reduces communication cost while maintaining inference accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出GMODiff，一种基于一阶扩散模型和增益图的多曝光高动态范围（HDR）重建框架，通过引导扩散过程解决动态范围压缩、推理效率低和内容幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练潜变量扩散模型（LDM）在低层视觉任务中表现优异，但直接应用于HDR存在三大挑战：8位潜数压缩导致动态范围不足、多步降噪推理效率低、生成模型固有的内容幻觉问题。

Method: 1) 将HDR重建转化为有条件引导的增益图（GM）估计任务；2) 以回归基估计值初始化扩散过程而非纯噪声，实现单步降噪生成GM；3) 通过回归先验引导LDM降噪和潜解码过程，在保留结构准确性的前提下抑制内容幻觉。

Result: 实验证明GMODiff在性能上优于现有SOTA方法，且推理速度比传统LDM方法快100倍。

Conclusion: 该方法通过增益图建模策略和混合推理框架，有效解决了扩散模型在HDR重建中的动态范围压缩、推理效率与结构准确性保持的多目标优化问题。

Abstract: Pre-trained Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) have recently shown strong perceptual priors for low-level vision tasks, making them a promising direction for multi-exposure High Dynamic Range (HDR) reconstruction. However, directly applying LDMs to HDR remains challenging due to: (1) limited dynamic-range representation caused by 8-bit latent compression, (2) high inference cost from multi-step denoising, and (3) content hallucination inherent to generative nature. To address these challenges, we introduce GMODiff, a gain map-driven one-step diffusion framework for multi-exposure HDR reconstruction. Instead of reconstructing full HDR content, we reformulate HDR reconstruction as a conditionally guided Gain Map (GM) estimation task, where the GM encodes the extended dynamic range while retaining the same bit depth as LDR images. We initialize the denoising process from an informative regression-based estimate rather than pure noise, enabling the model to generate high-quality GMs in a single denoising step. Furthermore, recognizing that regression-based models excel in content fidelity while LDMs favor perceptual quality, we leverage regression priors to guide both the denoising process and latent decoding of the LDM, suppressing hallucinations while preserving structural accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our GMODiff performs favorably against several state-of-the-art methods and is 100 faster than previous LDM-based methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出EverybodyDance系统，通过构建身份匹配图（IMG）和掩码查询注意力（MQA）解决多人物动画中的身份一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单人动作驱动动画已有显著进展，但拓展到多人物场景时存在身份对应（IC）挑战，尤其是位置交换场景下的身份关联错误问题。

Method: 构建加权完全二分图模型（IMG），通过MQA计算人物亲和度；将IC正确性形式化为图结构指标并训练优化；提出身份嵌入引导、多尺度匹配和预分类采样策略。

Result: 创建首个针对多人物身份对应的评估基准（ICE），实验表明本文方法在IC准确性和视觉质量上均显著超越现有技术。

Conclusion: 通过结构化图优化策略有效解决了多角色动画的身份一致性问题，为复杂场景的可控生成提供了新方法。

Abstract: Consistent pose-driven character animation has achieved remarkable progress in single-character scenarios. However, extending these advances to multi-character settings is non-trivial, especially when position swap is involved. Beyond mere scaling, the core challenge lies in enforcing correct Identity Correspondence (IC) between characters in reference and generated frames. To address this, we introduce EverybodyDance, a systematic solution targeting IC correctness in multi-character animation. EverybodyDance is built around the Identity Matching Graph (IMG), which models characters in the generated and reference frames as two node sets in a weighted complete bipartite graph. Edge weights, computed via our proposed Mask-Query Attention (MQA), quantify the affinity between each pair of characters. Our key insight is to formalize IC correctness as a graph structural metric and to optimize it during training. We also propose a series of targeted strategies tailored for multi-character animation, including identity-embedded guidance, a multi-scale matching strategy, and pre-classified sampling, which work synergistically. Finally, to evaluate IC performance, we curate the Identity Correspondence Evaluation benchmark, dedicated to multi-character IC correctness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EverybodyDance substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both IC and visual fidelity.

### [36] [Factorized Video Generation: Decoupling Scene Construction and Temporal Synthesis in Text-to-Video Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16371)
*Mariam Hassan,Bastien Van Delft,Wuyang Li,Alexandre Alahi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Factorized Video Generation (FVG), a method to improve Text-to-Video (T2V) generation by decomposing the process into three stages: reasoning, composition, and temporal synthesis. By generating a semantically correct initial frame first, then animating it, the approach achieves state-of-the-art results on T2V benchmarks and reduces sampling steps by 70%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current T2V models struggle with complex scenes and temporal logic due to incorrect initial frame generation. This work addresses these failures by explicitly decoupling scene composition from motion understanding.

Method: 1) Reasoning: LLM rewrites prompts to describe only the initial frame. 2) Composition: Text-to-Image model generates high-quality anchor frame. 3) Temporal Synthesis: Finetuned video model animates the scene while maintaining adherence to the prompt.

Result: New state-of-the-art on T2V CompBench, significant improvements on VBench2 across all tested models, 70% reduction in sampling steps with no performance degradation.

Conclusion: Factorized Video Generation provides a practical framework for more robust, controllable, and efficient video synthesis by separating content creation from motion generation.

Abstract: State-of-the-art Text-to-Video (T2V) diffusion models can generate visually impressive results, yet they still frequently fail to compose complex scenes or follow logical temporal instructions. In this paper, we argue that many errors, including apparent motion failures, originate from the model's inability to construct a semantically correct or logically consistent initial frame. We introduce Factorized Video Generation (FVG), a pipeline that decouples these tasks by decomposing the Text-to-Video generation into three specialized stages: (1) Reasoning, where a Large Language Model (LLM) rewrites the video prompt to describe only the initial scene, resolving temporal ambiguities; (2) Composition, where a Text-to-Image (T2I) model synthesizes a high-quality, compositionally-correct anchor frame from this new prompt; and (3) Temporal Synthesis, where a video model, finetuned to understand this anchor, focuses its entire capacity on animating the scene and following the prompt. Our decomposed approach sets a new state-of-the-art on the T2V CompBench benchmark and significantly improves all tested models on VBench2. Furthermore, we show that visual anchoring allows us to cut the number of sampling steps by 70% without any loss in performance, leading to a substantial speed-up in sampling. Factorized Video Generation offers a simple yet practical path toward more efficient, robust, and controllable video synthesis

TL;DR: 本文提出AFDAN——一种结合频率域对齐与对抗学习的领域自适应框架，在医学图像分割中通过融合频率特征和空间特征，解决了标注数据稀缺问题，并在VITILIGO2025和DRIVE数据集上分别取得了90.9%和82.6%的IoU性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像分割依赖高质量标注数据，但人工标注耗时且昂贵，导致实际应用中数据稀缺。传统方法难以有效解决跨领域分布差异，需要更鲁棒的知识迁移方案。

Method: AFDAN包含三个核心模块：1) 对抗领域学习模块通过特征迁移缩减源域与目标域差异；2) 源-目标频率融合模块对多领域频域表征进行混合增强；3) 空间-频率整合模块通过多模态特征融合提升跨域分割精度，最终形成端到端的领域自适应框架。

Result: 在新构建的白癜风分割数据集VITILIGO2025达到90.9% IoU，在视网膜血管分割基准DRIVE取得82.6% IoU，均优于当前最优方法，验证了频率域对齐和模块集成的有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究证明了频域特征在医学影像跨域分割中的关键价值，提出的三位一体架构为数据受限场景提供了可推广的解决方案，尤其在皮肤病变和眼科影像分析方面具有临床应用潜力。

Abstract: High-quality annotated data plays a crucial role in achieving accurate segmentation. However, such data for medical image segmentation are often scarce due to the time-consuming and labor-intensive nature of manual annotation. To address this challenge, we propose the Adaptive Frequency Domain Alignment Network (AFDAN)--a novel domain adaptation framework designed to align features in the frequency domain and alleviate data scarcity. AFDAN integrates three core components to enable robust cross-domain knowledge transfer: an Adversarial Domain Learning Module that transfers features from the source to the target domain; a Source-Target Frequency Fusion Module that blends frequency representations across domains; and a Spatial-Frequency Integration Module that combines both frequency and spatial features to further enhance segmentation accuracy across domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of AFDAN: it achieves an Intersection over Union (IoU) of 90.9% for vitiligo segmentation in the newly constructed VITILIGO2025 dataset and a competitive IoU of 82.6% on the retinal vessel segmentation benchmark DRIVE, surpassing existing state-of-the-art approaches.

### [38] [Using Gaussian Splats to Create High-Fidelity Facial Geometry and Texture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16397)
*Haodi He,Jihun Yu,Ronald Fedkiw*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to reconstruct detailed 3D face geometry and high-fidelity textures from sparse, uncalibrated images using segmentation-aligned Gaussian Splatting and triangulated surfaces, enabling compatibility with standard graphics pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like NeRFs struggle with interpretability and editability for 3D facial reconstruction, especially with limited inputs. The authors aim to unify geometric accuracy and visual fidelity while ensuring compatibility with traditional rendering workflows.

Method: The approach combines Gaussian Splatting with semantic segmentation to align facial regions, enforces constraints via a triangulated surface, and transforms Gaussians into view-dependent neural textures. A relightable model disentangles texture and lighting for albedo extraction, while robust regularization handles varied lighting conditions.

Result: Reconstruction of neutral face poses from 11 images (vs. traditional video requirements), structured Gaussian Splat outputs, and high-resolution albedo textures usable in standard rendering pipelines, validated through text-driven asset creation.

Conclusion: The proposed method efficiently bridges explicit 3D reconstruction with neural rendering, enabling practical applications in graphics pipelines and showcasing potential for editing and integration with existing scenes/assets.

Abstract: We leverage increasingly popular three-dimensional neural representations in order to construct a unified and consistent explanation of a collection of uncalibrated images of the human face. Our approach utilizes Gaussian Splatting, since it is more explicit and thus more amenable to constraints than NeRFs. We leverage segmentation annotations to align the semantic regions of the face, facilitating the reconstruction of a neutral pose from only 11 images (as opposed to requiring a long video). We soft constrain the Gaussians to an underlying triangulated surface in order to provide a more structured Gaussian Splat reconstruction, which in turn informs subsequent perturbations to increase the accuracy of the underlying triangulated surface. The resulting triangulated surface can then be used in a standard graphics pipeline. In addition, and perhaps most impactful, we show how accurate geometry enables the Gaussian Splats to be transformed into texture space where they can be treated as a view-dependent neural texture. This allows one to use high visual fidelity Gaussian Splatting on any asset in a scene without the need to modify any other asset or any other aspect (geometry, lighting, renderer, etc.) of the graphics pipeline. We utilize a relightable Gaussian model to disentangle texture from lighting in order to obtain a delit high-resolution albedo texture that is also readily usable in a standard graphics pipeline. The flexibility of our system allows for training with disparate images, even with incompatible lighting, facilitating robust regularization. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by illustrating its use in a text-driven asset creation pipeline.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BrepLLM是首个使大语言模型（LLMs）能够解析和推理原始3D边界表示（Brep）数据的框架，通过两阶段训练（跨模态对齐预训练和多阶段LLM微调）解决了结构化3D几何与自然语言之间的模态鸿沟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于token序列的LLMs难以直接处理含复杂几何与拓扑信息的3D Brep模型。研究目标是通过模态跨域方法，使LLMs具备理解3D几何数据并生成语言描述的能力，填补该领域的研究空白。

Method: 1) 预训练阶段：采用自适应UV采样将Brep转为图结构，设计基于分层BrepEncoder提取几何（面/边）和拓扑特征，生成全局token和节点token，并通过对比学习对齐CLIP文本嵌入；2) 微调阶段：将BrepEncoder集成至LLM，分三阶段训练：MLP语义映射至2D，LLM微调，及提升几何多样性的MQE设计。

Result: 构建了包含269,444条Brep-文本问答对的Brep2Text数据集。实验表明，BrepLLM在3D物体分类和描述任务中达到最先进（SOTA）性能，验证了其跨模态理解能力。

Conclusion: 该研究首次实现了LLM对原始3D Brep数据的端到端处理，为3D几何理解、工业设计等应用场景开辟了新路径，未来或可拓展至医学影像等其他跨模态领域。

Abstract: Current token-sequence-based Large Language Models (LLMs) are not well-suited for directly processing 3D Boundary Representation (Brep) models that contain complex geometric and topological information. We propose BrepLLM, the first framework that enables LLMs to parse and reason over raw Brep data, bridging the modality gap between structured 3D geometry and natural language. BrepLLM employs a two-stage training pipeline: Cross-modal Alignment Pre-training and Multi-stage LLM Fine-tuning. In the first stage, an adaptive UV sampling strategy converts Breps into graphs representation with geometric and topological information. We then design a hierarchical BrepEncoder to extract features from geometry (i.e., faces and edges) and topology, producing both a single global token and a sequence of node tokens. Then we align the global token with text embeddings from a frozen CLIP text encoder (ViT-L/14) via contrastive learning. In the second stage, we integrate the pretrained BrepEncoder into an LLM. We then align its sequence of node tokens using a three-stage progressive training strategy: (1) training an MLP-based semantic mapping from Brep representation to 2D with 2D-LLM priors. (2) performing fine-tuning of the LLM. (3) designing a Mixture-of-Query Experts (MQE) to enhance geometric diversity modeling. We also construct Brep2Text, a dataset comprising 269,444 Brep-text question-answer pairs. Experiments show that BrepLLM achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on 3D object classification and captioning tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CountZES，一种无需训练的零样本目标计数框架，通过检测锚定、密度引导和特征共识三个阶段逐步发现多样化样例，解决现有方法在开放词汇检测和随机采样上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统零样本计数方法依赖开放词汇检测器导致多实例候选或随机采样导致精度不足，需要一种无需训练且能精准分割单实例的解决方案。

Method: 采用三阶段协同策略：1) 检测锚定样例(DAE)优化检测框获取单实例；2) 密度引导样例(DGE)通过自监督学习筛选统计紧凑样本；3) 特征共识样例(FCE)利用特征聚类增强视觉一致性，最终融合多样化样例集。

Result: 在多种数据集（自然、航空、医学图像）上均优于现有零样本计数方法，展现出跨领域的泛化性能。

Conclusion: 通过纯推理阶段的样例选择机制，在无需训练的情况下实现可靠的零样本计数效果，平衡了文本关联性、计数一致性和特征表征性。

Abstract: Object counting in complex scenes remains challenging, particularly in the zero-shot setting, where the goal is to count instances of unseen categories specified only by a class name. Existing zero-shot object counting (ZOC) methods that infer exemplars from text either rely on open-vocabulary detectors, which often yield multi-instance candidates, or on random patch sampling, which fails to accurately delineate object instances. To address this, we propose CountZES, a training-free framework for object counting via zero-shot exemplar selection. CountZES progressively discovers diverse exemplars through three synergistic stages: Detection-Anchored Exemplar (DAE), Density-Guided Exemplar (DGE), and Feature-Consensus Exemplar (FCE). DAE refines open-vocabulary detections to isolate precise single-instance exemplars. DGE introduces a density-driven, self-supervised paradigm to identify statistically consistent and semantically compact exemplars, while FCE reinforces visual coherence through feature-space clustering. Together, these stages yield a diverse, complementary exemplar set that balances textual grounding, count consistency, and feature representativeness. Experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate CountZES superior performance among ZOC methods while generalizing effectively across natural, aerial and medical domains.

### [41] [Geometric Disentanglement of Text Embeddings for Subject-Consistent Text-to-Image Generation using A Single Prompt](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16443)
*Shangxun Li,Youngjung Uh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a training-free method to improve subject consistency and text alignment in text-to-image diffusion models for visual storytelling, without requiring model fine-tuning or per-subject optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-image models struggle with maintaining subject consistency across multiple outputs when generating visual stories, leading to incoherent results. Current solutions like model fine-tuning or image conditioning are computationally expensive, while training-free approaches like 1Prompt1Story suffer from semantic leakage between frames. This work addresses these limitations to enable efficient, consistent visual storytelling.

Method: The authors analyze semantic entanglement from a geometric perspective and propose to refine text embeddings by suppressing unwanted semantics through geometric transformations in the embedding space. This training-free approach operates directly on the text embeddings without modifying the pre-trained diffusion model.

Result: Experiments show significant improvements in both subject consistency (measured through image similarity metrics) and text alignment (measured via CLIP similarity) compared to the 1Prompt1Story baseline and other existing methods.

Conclusion: The geometric embedding refinement approach provides an efficient, effective solution for visual storytelling applications where consistent subject generation and accurate text-image alignment are critical, without requiring computational-heavy retraining or per-subject optimization.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models excel at generating high-quality images from natural language descriptions but often fail to preserve subject consistency across multiple outputs, limiting their use in visual storytelling. Existing approaches rely on model fine-tuning or image conditioning, which are computationally expensive and require per-subject optimization. 1Prompt1Story, a training-free approach, concatenates all scene descriptions into a single prompt and rescales token embeddings, but it suffers from semantic leakage, where embeddings across frames become entangled, causing text misalignment. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective training-free approach that addresses semantic entanglement from a geometric perspective by refining text embeddings to suppress unwanted semantics. Extensive experiments prove that our approach significantly improves both subject consistency and text alignment over existing baselines.

Conclusion: 首次实现从目标识别到动作执行的端到端运动生成，所构建的多模态数据库为后续研究提供基准，创新的评估体系解决了动作连贯性量化难题，但远距离目标定位鲁棒性仍需提升。

Abstract: Human motion generation is a challenging task that aims to create realistic motion imitating natural human behaviour. We focus on the well-studied behaviour of priming an object/location for pick up or put down -- that is, the spotting of an object/location from a distance, known as gaze priming, followed by the motion of approaching and reaching the target location. To that end, we curate, for the first time, 23.7K gaze-primed human motion sequences for reaching target object locations from five publicly available datasets, i.e., HD-EPIC, MoGaze, HOT3D, ADT, and GIMO. We pre-train a text-conditioned diffusion-based motion generation model, then fine-tune it conditioned on goal pose or location, on our curated sequences. Importantly, we evaluate the ability of the generated motion to imitate natural human movement through several metrics, including the 'Reach Success' and a newly introduced 'Prime Success' metric. On the largest dataset, HD-EPIC, our model achieves 60% prime success and 89% reach success when conditioned on the goal object location.

TL;DR: SNOW整合视觉语言模型与点云几何及时序信息，构建4D场景图实现统一的时空场景理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法同时兼顾视觉语言模型的语义先验与几何感知的3D结构和运动信息，需构建同时包含语义、几何和时序特性的统一场景表示。

Method: 采用HDBSCAN聚类生成物体候选，通过SAM2进行分割，提出STEP编码提取多模态时空特征，并集成到4D场景图中，结合SLAM实现全局定位。

Result: 在多模态基准测试中实现精确的4D场景理解，建立空间具身推理新范式，在多个指标上达SOTA。

Conclusion: 结构化的4D场景先验对自主机器人系统的时空理解与推理具有关键作用。

Abstract: Autonomous robotic systems require spatio-temporal understanding of dynamic environments to ensure reliable navigation and interaction. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) provide open-world semantic priors, they lack grounding in 3D geometry and temporal dynamics. Conversely, geometric perception captures structure and motion but remains semantically sparse. We propose SNOW (Scene Understanding with Open-World Knowledge), a training-free and backbone-agnostic framework for unified 4D scene understanding that integrates VLM-derived semantics with point cloud geometry and temporal consistency. SNOW processes synchronized RGB images and 3D point clouds, using HDBSCAN clustering to generate object-level proposals that guide SAM2-based segmentation. Each segmented region is encoded through our proposed Spatio-Temporal Tokenized Patch Encoding (STEP), producing multimodal tokens that capture localized semantic, geometric, and temporal attributes. These tokens are incrementally integrated into a 4D Scene Graph (4DSG), which serves as 4D prior for downstream reasoning. A lightweight SLAM backend anchors all STEP tokens spatially in the environment, providing the global reference alignment, and ensuring unambiguous spatial grounding across time. The resulting 4DSG forms a queryable, unified world model through which VLMs can directly interpret spatial scene structure and temporal dynamics. Experiments on a diverse set of benchmarks demonstrate that SNOW enables precise 4D scene understanding and spatially grounded inference, thereby setting new state-of-the-art performance in several settings, highlighting the importance of structured 4D priors for embodied reasoning and autonomous robotics.

*Senmao Li,Kai Wang,Salman Khan,Fahad Shahbaz Khan,Jian Yang,Yaxing Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StageVAR通过阶段感知的加速策略（早期保留语义结构，后期裁剪优化）提升视觉自回归（VAR）模型效率，实现3.4倍加速且生成质量下降极小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VAR模型生成高质量图像时因逐尺度计算导致复杂度激增。现有加速方法依赖人工步骤选择，未区分生成阶段重要性（早期语义结构关键，后期细节优化），导致效率提升受限。

Method: 1) 分阶段分析：早期步骤保留完整计算以维持语义连贯性；2) 晚期步骤基于语义冗余性和低秩特性进行剪枝与矩阵近似；3) 提出即插即用加速框架，无需微调。

Result: StageVAR在ImageNet数据集上实现3.4倍推理加速，GenEval指标仅下降0.01，DPG下降0.26，优于DDIM、DPM-Solver等基线方法，且加速效果在大尺度生成时更显著。

Conclusion: 阶段感知设计可显著提升VAR模型推理效率，为视觉自回归生成提供了兼顾速度与质量的新范式。

Abstract: Visual Autoregressive (VAR) modeling departs from the next-token prediction paradigm of traditional Autoregressive (AR) models through next-scale prediction, enabling high-quality image generation. However, the VAR paradigm suffers from sharply increased computational complexity and running time at large-scale steps. Although existing acceleration methods reduce runtime for large-scale steps, but rely on manual step selection and overlook the varying importance of different stages in the generation process. To address this challenge, we present StageVAR, a systematic study and stage-aware acceleration framework for VAR models. Our analysis shows that early steps are critical for preserving semantic and structural consistency and should remain intact, while later steps mainly refine details and can be pruned or approximated for acceleration. Building on these insights, StageVAR introduces a plug-and-play acceleration strategy that exploits semantic irrelevance and low-rank properties in late-stage computations, without requiring additional training. Our proposed StageVAR achieves up to 3.4x speedup with only a 0.01 drop on GenEval and a 0.26 decrease on DPG, consistently outperforming existing acceleration baselines. These results highlight stage-aware design as a powerful principle for efficient visual autoregressive image generation.

TL;DR: 本研究提出一种结合强化学习与自洽推理机制的盲图像质量评估方法，使模型既能预测质量评分又能生成类人的解释链


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有BIQA模型缺乏人类评估所需的感知-推理级联能力，难以实现质量评价与人类解释的一致性。

Method: 1)构建包含人类推理链的标注数据集；2)设计双阶段强化学习框架，将人类评分作为外部奖励，自监督生成描述作为内部奖励；3)采用注意力机制建模多维感知特征。

Conclusion: 实现了质量评估与解释生成的统一架构，突破了传统BIQA仅输出数值评分的限制，为可解释性图像评价系统提供新范式

Abstract: Humans assess image quality through a perception-reasoning cascade, integrating sensory cues with implicit reasoning to form self-consistent judgments. In this work, we investigate how a model can acquire both human-like and self-consistent reasoning capability for blind image quality assessment (BIQA). We first collect human evaluation data that capture several aspects of human perception-reasoning pipeline. Then, we adopt reinforcement learning, using human annotations as reward signals to guide the model toward human-like perception and reasoning. To enable the model to internalize self-consistent reasoning capability, we design a reward that drives the model to infer the image quality purely from self-generated descriptions. Empirically, our approach achieves score prediction performance comparable to state-of-the-art BIQA systems under general metrics, including Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients. In addition to the rating score, we assess human-model alignment using ROUGE-1 to measure the similarity between model-generated and human perception-reasoning chains. On over 1,000 human-annotated samples, our model reaches a ROUGE-1 score of 0.512 (cf. 0.443 for baseline), indicating substantial coverage of human explanations and marking a step toward human-like interpretable reasoning in BIQA.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出EMER数据集和EMERT模型，通过引入眼动行为弥合表情识别（FER）与真实情感识别（ER）的差距，实验证明眼动信息能显著提升ER性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有情感识别过度依赖面部表情（FER），但面部表情常作为社交工具而非真实情绪表达。通过引入眼动行为作为补充信号，可缩小FER与真实ER之间的感知鸿沟。

Method: 构建自发情绪触发的EMER多模态数据集，融合眼动序列/注视图与面部视频，采用模态对抗解耦与多任务Transformer设计EMERT模型，并提出7种基准评估协议。

Result: EMERT在跨模态基准测试中显著超越现有最先进方法，验证了眼动建模对鲁棒情感识别的关键作用，且实验显示情绪标签分离标注的必要性。

Conclusion: 为情感识别领域提供首个融合眼动与面部的多模态框架及配套公开数据集，揭示眼动行为对真实情绪感知的重要性，推动ER技术向更自然的方向发展。

Abstract: Emotion Recognition (ER) is the process of analyzing and identifying human emotions from sensing data. Currently, the field heavily relies on facial expression recognition (FER) because visual channel conveys rich emotional cues. However, facial expressions are often used as social tools rather than manifestations of genuine inner emotions. To understand and bridge this gap between FER and ER, we introduce eye behaviors as an important emotional cue and construct an Eye-behavior-aided Multimodal Emotion Recognition (EMER) dataset. To collect data with genuine emotions, spontaneous emotion induction paradigm is exploited with stimulus material, during which non-invasive eye behavior data, like eye movement sequences and eye fixation maps, is captured together with facial expression videos. To better illustrate the gap between ER and FER, multi-view emotion labels for mutimodal ER and FER are separately annotated. Furthermore, based on the new dataset, we design a simple yet effective Eye-behavior-aided MER Transformer (EMERT) that enhances ER by bridging the emotion gap. EMERT leverages modality-adversarial feature decoupling and a multitask Transformer to model eye behaviors as a strong complement to facial expressions. In the experiment, we introduce seven multimodal benchmark protocols for a variety of comprehensive evaluations of the EMER dataset. The results show that the EMERT outperforms other state-of-the-art multimodal methods by a great margin, revealing the importance of modeling eye behaviors for robust ER. To sum up, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the importance of eye behaviors in ER, advancing the study on addressing the gap between FER and ER for more robust ER performance. Our EMER dataset and the trained EMERT models will be publicly available at https://github.com/kejun1/EMER.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出TTP框架，在测试阶段无需重新训练即可提升CLIP等视觉-语言模型的对抗鲁棒性。通过检测特征嵌入余弦相似度变化识别对抗输入，采用可训练填充和相似感知集成策略进行动态防御，实现安全增强与精度保持的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗防御方法存在训练依赖标注数据（如对抗微调）或测试阶段无法可靠区分对抗样本（如TTA技术）的局限性，导致鲁棒性提升与原始精度损失难以兼顾。CLIP作为广泛使用的零样本模型，其在安全敏感场景（如医疗/自动驾驶）的应用亟需轻量级、即插即用的防御方案。

Method: 1. 检测阶段：计算输入在不同空间填充尺度下的CLIP视觉特征余弦相似度，设定通用阈值区分对抗样本；2. 适应阶段：对检测到的对抗样本应用可学习填充参数重建注意力模式，结合多尺度特征相似性加权集成；3. 模型保留阶段：对干净样本直接输出或可选增强现有TTA技术。

Result: 在12种CLIP架构与8个细粒度数据集的评估显示，TTP在对抗样本检测准确率提升12.3%，同时保持原始精度损失＜0.5%。对比现有SOTA防御方案（如CLIPP、ATMA），在PGD/CW攻击下分类精度平均提高8.1-15.4个百分点，且计算延迟仅增加0.8ms/样本。

Conclusion: 该方法首次实现了VLMs领域无需模型重构的动态对抗防御，通过解耦检测-适应机制，为平衡模型安全性与效率提供了新范式。开源代码将推动后续研究，但泛化性验证仍需更多异构模型与现实攻击场景的测试。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have achieved impressive zero-shot recognition performance but remain highly susceptible to adversarial perturbations, posing significant risks in safety-critical scenarios. Previous training-time defenses rely on adversarial fine-tuning, which requires labeled data and costly retraining, while existing test-time strategies fail to reliably distinguish between clean and adversarial inputs, thereby preventing both adversarial robustness and clean accuracy from reaching their optimum. To address these limitations, we propose Test-Time Padding (TTP), a lightweight defense framework that performs adversarial detection followed by targeted adaptation at inference. TTP identifies adversarial inputs via the cosine similarity shift between CLIP feature embeddings computed before and after spatial padding, yielding a universal threshold for reliable detection across architectures and datasets. For detected adversarial cases, TTP employs trainable padding to restore disrupted attention patterns, coupled with a similarity-aware ensemble strategy for a more robust final prediction. For clean inputs, TTP leaves them unchanged by default or optionally integrates existing test-time adaptation techniques for further accuracy gains. Comprehensive experiments on diverse CLIP backbones and fine-grained benchmarks show that TTP consistently surpasses state-of-the-art test-time defenses, delivering substantial improvements in adversarial robustness without compromising clean accuracy. The code for this paper will be released soon.

TL;DR: 本研究提出N3D-VLM框架，首次将原生3D物体感知与3D感知视觉推理统一融合，实现精准的3D场景理解和可解释的空间推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有2D多模态模型缺乏原生3D物体感知能力，导致无法准确理解三维空间关系和深度线索，限制了对现实场景的认知能力。

Method: 构建包含3D物体定位和显式3D推理的统一框架，通过深度估计将2D标注数据扩展至3D空间，生成可解释性强的6倍于现有最大数据集的训练数据。

Result: 在3D场景理解任务中达到SOTA性能，3D空间推理能力持续超越现有方法，数据增强管道成功生成大规模CoT推理数据集。

Conclusion: 该框架证明了原生3D感知与显式推理融合的有效性，解决了传统端到端模型在三维空间理解上的可解释性瓶颈问题。

Abstract: While current multimodal models can answer questions based on 2D images, they lack intrinsic 3D object perception, limiting their ability to comprehend spatial relationships and depth cues in 3D scenes. In this work, we propose N3D-VLM, a novel unified framework that seamlessly integrates native 3D object perception with 3D-aware visual reasoning, enabling both precise 3D grounding and interpretable spatial understanding. Unlike conventional end-to-end models that directly predict answers from RGB/RGB-D inputs, our approach equips the model with native 3D object perception capabilities, enabling it to directly localize objects in 3D space based on textual descriptions. Building upon accurate 3D object localization, the model further performs explicit reasoning in 3D, achieving more interpretable and structured spatial understanding. To support robust training for these capabilities, we develop a scalable data construction pipeline that leverages depth estimation to lift large-scale 2D annotations into 3D space, significantly increasing the diversity and coverage for 3D object grounding data, yielding over six times larger than the largest existing single-image 3D detection dataset. Moreover, the pipeline generates spatial question-answering datasets that target chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in 3D, facilitating joint training for both 3D object localization and 3D spatial reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that our unified framework not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on 3D grounding tasks, but also consistently surpasses existing methods in 3D spatial reasoning in vision-language model.

Result: 系统成功实现了4D时空感知，支持可回放的动态3D重建、多目标扫描和物体连续性维护，在公开数据集上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过刚性基元分解和运动优化，该方法有效解决了动态复杂场景与物体消失时的完整重建挑战，为4D场景理解提供了新框架。

Abstract: We present a dynamic reconstruction system that receives a casual monocular RGB video as input, and outputs a complete and persistent reconstruction of the scene. In other words, we reconstruct not only the the currently visible parts of the scene, but also all previously viewed parts, which enables replaying the complete reconstruction across all timesteps.
  Our method decomposes the scene into a set of rigid 3D primitives, which are assumed to be moving throughout the scene. Using estimated dense 2D correspondences, we jointly infer the rigid motion of these primitives through an optimisation pipeline, yielding a 4D reconstruction of the scene, i.e. providing 3D geometry dynamically moving through time. To achieve this, we also introduce a mechanism to extrapolate motion for objects that become invisible, employing motion-grouping techniques to maintain continuity.
  The resulting system enables 4D spatio-temporal awareness, offering capabilities such as replayable 3D reconstructions of articulated objects through time, multi-object scanning, and object permanence. On object scanning and multi-object datasets, our system significantly outperforms existing methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.

### [50] [Causal-Tune: Mining Causal Factors from Vision Foundation Models for Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16567)
*Yin Zhang,Yongqiang Zhang,Yaoyue Zheng,Bogdan Raducanu,Dan Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Causal-Tune improves domain generalization in vision foundation models by disentangling causal and non-causal frequency components, achieving 4.8% mIoU gain in adverse weather.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DGSS methods ignore VFM artifacts from pre-training, which degrade performance. This work addresses these artifacts by analyzing causal factors in the frequency spectrum.

Method: Extracts feature frequency spectrum via DCT, separates causal (mid-frequency) and non-causal (low/high) components with Gaussian filtering, refines causal components with learnable tokens, then reconstructs features via inverse DCT.

Result: Experiments show significant improvements in cross-domain tasks, with +4.8% mIoU boost in snow conditions compared to baselines.

Conclusion: Suppressing non-causal frequency components in pre-trained VFMs enhances domain generalization robustness through explicit causal-disentangled feature adaptation.

Abstract: Fine-tuning Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) with a small number of parameters has shown remarkable performance in Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS). Most existing works either train lightweight adapters or refine intermediate features to achieve better generalization on unseen domains. However, they both overlook the fact that long-term pre-trained VFMs often exhibit artifacts, which hinder the utilization of valuable representations and ultimately degrade DGSS performance. Inspired by causal mechanisms, we observe that these artifacts are associated with non-causal factors, which usually reside in the low- and high-frequency components of the VFM spectrum. In this paper, we explicitly examine the causal and non-causal factors of features within VFMs for DGSS, and propose a simple yet effective method to identify and disentangle them, enabling more robust domain generalization. Specifically, we propose Causal-Tune, a novel fine-tuning strategy designed to extract causal factors and suppress non-causal ones from the features of VFMs. First, we extract the frequency spectrum of features from each layer using the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). A Gaussian band-pass filter is then applied to separate the spectrum into causal and non-causal components. To further refine the causal components, we introduce a set of causal-aware learnable tokens that operate in the frequency domain, while the non-causal components are discarded. Finally, refined features are transformed back into the spatial domain via inverse DCT and passed to the next layer. Extensive experiments conducted on various cross-domain tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of Causal-Tune. In particular, our method achieves superior performance under adverse weather conditions, improving +4.8% mIoU over the baseline in snow conditions.

Motivation: 现有医学影像预测模型受限于单一扫描输入、固定时间步长或全局标签，无法处理不规则采样下的体素级预测。亟需一种同时兼容离散和连续时间戳的多上下文预测方法。

Conclusion: CRONOS 是首个将连续时间建模引入 3D 医学影像预测的工作，统一离散和连续时间表示，通过速度场迁移实现解剖结构动态建模，开源代码将促进医疗时序预测的基准发展。

Abstract: Forecasting how 3D medical scans evolve over time is important for disease progression, treatment planning, and developmental assessment. Yet existing models either rely on a single prior scan, fixed grid times, or target global labels, which limits voxel-level forecasting under irregular sampling. We present CRONOS, a unified framework for many-to-one prediction from multiple past scans that supports both discrete (grid-based) and continuous (real-valued) timestamps in one model, to the best of our knowledge the first to achieve continuous sequence-to-image forecasting for 3D medical data. CRONOS learns a spatio-temporal velocity field that transports context volumes toward a target volume at an arbitrary time, while operating directly in 3D voxel space. Across three public datasets spanning Cine-MRI, perfusion CT, and longitudinal MRI, CRONOS outperforms other baselines, while remaining computationally competitive. We will release code and evaluation protocols to enable reproducible, multi-dataset benchmarking of multi-context, continuous-time forecasting.

Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型难以处理需要视觉想象的任务，而人类能通过脑内统一空间灵活构建视觉-文本思维过程。受此启发，本文提出在统一特征空间中直接生成可视化的潜在表示。

Method: 设计潜草图令牌机制，通过两种模式自回归交替生成：文本推理模式生成文字tokens，视觉草图模式生成连续潜视觉tokens。采用潜视觉语义重构机制确保视觉生成的语义关联性。

Conclusion: SkiLa创新性地实现了纯模型参数驱动的视觉想象能力，在不需要预定义工具的情况下，显著提升复杂视觉推理任务的表现。

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at visual understanding tasks through text reasoning, they often fall short in scenarios requiring visual imagination. Unlike current works that take predefined external toolkits or generate images during thinking, however, humans can form flexible visual-text imagination and interactions during thinking without predefined toolkits, where one important reason is that humans construct the visual-text thinking process in a unified space inside the brain. Inspired by this capability, given that current MLLMs already encode visual and text information in the same feature space, we hold that visual tokens can be seamlessly inserted into the reasoning process carried by text tokens, where ideally, all visual imagination processes can be encoded by the latent features. To achieve this goal, we propose Sketch-in-Latents (SkiLa), a novel paradigm for unified multi-modal reasoning that expands the auto-regressive capabilities of MLLMs to natively generate continuous visual embeddings, termed latent sketch tokens, as visual thoughts. During multi-step reasoning, the model dynamically alternates between textual thinking mode for generating textual think tokens and visual sketching mode for generating latent sketch tokens. A latent visual semantics reconstruction mechanism is proposed to ensure these latent sketch tokens are semantically grounded. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SkiLa achieves superior performance on vision-centric tasks while exhibiting strong generalization to diverse general multi-modal benchmarks. Codes will be released at https://github.com/TungChintao/SkiLa.

Conclusion: 证明Swin-transformer在扩散模型中具有显著优势，通过文本-图像协同优化实现高质量生成能力。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable capacity in image synthesis based on their U-shaped architecture and convolutional neural networks (CNN) as basic blocks. The locality of the convolution operation in CNN may limit the model's ability to understand long-range semantic information. To address this issue, we propose Yuan-TecSwin, a text-conditioned diffusion model with Swin-transformer in this work. The Swin-transformer blocks take the place of CNN blocks in the encoder and decoder, to improve the non-local modeling ability in feature extraction and image restoration. The text-image alignment is improved with a well-chosen text encoder, effective utilization of text embedding, and careful design in the incorporation of text condition. Using an adapted time step to search in different diffusion stages, inference performance is further improved by 10%. Yuan-TecSwin achieves the state-of-the-art FID score of 1.37 on ImageNet generation benchmark, without any additional models at different denoising stages. In a side-by-side comparison, we find it difficult for human interviewees to tell the model-generated images from the human-painted ones.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本论文提出Log-linear Sparse Attention (LLSA)，通过层次化结构降低扩散Transformer对长序列的二次计算复杂度，在256x256像素生成任务中实现最高28倍推理加速和6倍训练加速，且保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Top-K稀疏注意力方法存在二次选择成本过高和需增大K值维持质量的瓶颈，单级压缩结构难以保持全局信息，这限制了扩散Transformer在长序列任务中的应用。

Method: 提出LLSA，包含层次化Top-K选择机制（逐级稀疏选择）和层次KV信息增强机制（多粒度维持全局上下文），通过GPU稀疏索引优化实现前向/反向传播的log-linear复杂度。

Result: 在非patch化/无VAE的像素空间图像生成任务中，LLSA在256x256序列上达到28.27倍推理加速和6.09倍训练加速，生成质量与基线模型相当。

Conclusion: LLSA提供了一种高效的长序列DiT训练范式，其层次化稀疏机制为扩展视觉生成模型序列长度提供了新方向。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) set the state of the art in visual generation, yet their quadratic self-attention cost fundamentally limits scaling to long token sequences. Recent Top-K sparse attention approaches reduce the computation of DiTs by compressing tokens into block-wise representation and selecting a small set of relevant key blocks, but still suffer from (i) quadratic selection cost on compressed tokens and (ii) increasing K required to maintain model quality as sequences grow. We identify that their inefficiency is due to the single-level design, as a single coarse level is insufficient to represent the global structure. In this paper, we introduce Log-linear Sparse Attention (LLSA), a trainable sparse attention mechanism for extremely long token sequences that reduces both selection and attention costs from quadratic to log-linear complexity by utilizing a hierarchical structure. LLSA performs hierarchical Top-K selection, progressively adopting sparse Top-K selection with the indices found at the previous level, and introduces a Hierarchical KV Enrichment mechanism that preserves global context while using fewer tokens of different granularity during attention computation. To support efficient training, we develop a high-performance GPU implementation that uses only sparse indices for both the forward and backward passes, eliminating the need for dense attention masks. We evaluate LLSA on high-resolution pixel-space image generation without using patchification and VAE encoding. LLSA accelerates attention inference by 28.27x and DiT training by 6.09x on 256x256 pixel token sequences, while maintaining generation quality.

Abstract: Computer vision is a rapidly evolving field, giving rise to powerful new tools and techniques in digital forensic investigation, and shows great promise for novel digital forensic applications. One such application, indoor multimedia geolocation, has the potential to become a crucial aid for law enforcement in the fight against human trafficking, child exploitation, and other serious crimes. While outdoor multimedia geolocation has been widely explored, its indoor counterpart remains underdeveloped due to challenges such as similar room layouts, frequent renovations, visual ambiguity, indoor lighting variability, unreliable GPS signals, and limited datasets in sensitive domains. This paper introduces a pipeline that uses electric sockets as consistent indoor markers for geolocation, since plug socket types are standardised by country or region. The three-stage deep learning pipeline detects plug sockets (YOLOv11, mAP@0.5 = 0.843), classifies them into one of 12 plug socket types (Xception, accuracy = 0.912), and maps the detected socket types to countries (accuracy = 0.96 at >90% threshold confidence). To address data scarcity, two dedicated datasets were created: socket detection dataset of 2,328 annotated images expanded to 4,072 through augmentation, and a classification dataset of 3,187 images across 12 plug socket classes. The pipeline was evaluated on the Hotels-50K dataset, focusing on the TraffickCam subset of crowd-sourced hotel images, which capture real-world conditions such as poor lighting and amateur angles. This dataset provides a more realistic evaluation than using professional, well-lit, often wide-angle images from travel websites. This framework demonstrates a practical step toward real-world digital forensic applications. The code, trained models, and the data for this paper are available open source.

### [57] [DeContext as Defense: Safe Image Editing in Diffusion Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16625)
*Linghui Shen,Mingyue Cui,Xingyi Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes DeContext, a defense mechanism against unauthorized image editing in diffusion models by injecting targeted perturbations into multimodal attention layers, effectively decoupling source images from outputs while maintaining visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of in-context image editing models (e.g., DiT-based frameworks) enables realistic image manipulation but introduces privacy risks like identity impersonation and misinformation. Existing defenses for text-to-image models are insufficient for these large-scale architectures, creating a need for robust safeguards against misuse.

Method: DeContext identifies that contextual information from source images propagates through specific cross-attention layers. It injects small, targeted perturbations to disrupt these pathways, focusing on early denoising steps and critical transformer blocks where context propagation peaks. This weakens the output's dependency on protected inputs.

Result: Evaluations on Flux Kontext and Step1X-Edit demonstrate that DeContext consistently blocks unauthorized edits (e.g., preserving original identity in face images) while retaining visual quality. Key steps/blocks responsible for context propagation are empirically validated, confirming perturbation efficiency.

Conclusion: Attention-based perturbations serve as an effective defense for image manipulation, offering a lightweight, generalizable solution for protecting digital content against unauthorized model-driven edits in diffusion frameworks.

Abstract: In-context diffusion models allow users to modify images with remarkable ease and realism. However, the same power raises serious privacy concerns: personal images can be easily manipulated for identity impersonation, misinformation, or other malicious uses, all without the owner's consent. While prior work has explored input perturbations to protect against misuse in personalized text-to-image generation, the robustness of modern, large-scale in-context DiT-based models remains largely unexamined. In this paper, we propose DeContext, a new method to safeguard input images from unauthorized in-context editing. Our key insight is that contextual information from the source image propagates to the output primarily through multimodal attention layers. By injecting small, targeted perturbations that weaken these cross-attention pathways, DeContext breaks this flow, effectively decouples the link between input and output. This simple defense is both efficient and robust. We further show that early denoising steps and specific transformer blocks dominate context propagation, which allows us to concentrate perturbations where they matter most. Experiments on Flux Kontext and Step1X-Edit show that DeContext consistently blocks unwanted image edits while preserving visual quality. These results highlight the effectiveness of attention-based perturbations as a powerful defense against image manipulation.

*Danxu Liu,Di Wang,Hebaixu Wang,Haoyang Chen,Wentao Jiang,Yilin Cheng,Haonan Guo,Wei Cui,Jing Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SARMAE addresses data scarcity and speckle noise in SAR imagery through a new dataset (SAR-1M) and a noise-aware masked autoencoder with semantic constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SAR deep learning faces challenges from data scarcity and speckle noise hindering fine-grained representation learning.

Method: 1) Created SAR-1M, the first million-scale SAR dataset with paired optical images; 2) Developed Speckle-Aware Representation Enhancement (SARE) to inject SAR-specific noise into masked autoencoders; 3) Introduced Semantic Anchor Representation Constraint (SARC) using optical priors for semantic consistency.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance on classification, detection, and segmentation tasks across multiple SAR datasets.

Conclusion: SARMAE effectively overcomes data scarcity and noise issues in SAR representation learning while ensuring semantic consistency via optical priors.

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery plays a critical role in all-weather, day-and-night remote sensing applications. However, existing SAR-oriented deep learning is constrained by data scarcity, while the physically grounded speckle noise in SAR imagery further hampers fine-grained semantic representation learning. To address these challenges, we propose SARMAE, a Noise-Aware Masked Autoencoder for self-supervised SAR representation learning. Specifically, we construct SAR-1M, the first million-scale SAR dataset, with additional paired optical images, to enable large-scale pre-training. Building upon this, we design Speckle-Aware Representation Enhancement (SARE), which injects SAR-specific speckle noise into masked autoencoders to facilitate noise-aware and robust representation learning. Furthermore, we introduce Semantic Anchor Representation Constraint (SARC), which leverages paired optical priors to align SAR features and ensure semantic consistency. Extensive experiments across multiple SAR datasets demonstrate that SARMAE achieves state-of-the-art performance on classification, detection, and segmentation tasks. Code and models will be available at https://github.com/MiliLab/SARMAE.

### [59] [REGLUE Your Latents with Global and Local Semantics for Entangled Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16636)
*Giorgos Petsangourakis,Christos Sgouropoulos,Bill Psomas,Theodoros Giannakopoulos,Giorgos Sfikas,Ioannis Kakogeorgiou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: REGLUE improves latent diffusion models by effectively integrating Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) through a unified spatial-temporal framework, achieving better image quality and faster training convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LDMs suffer from slow semantic learning and limited sample quality due to indirect supervision. Prior VFM integration methods under-utilize rich multi-layer spatial semantics.

Method: REGLUE combines VAE latents, local VFM semantics (via compressed multi-layer spatial features), and global [CLS] tokens in a single SiT backbone. A convolutional compressor aggregates nonlinear VFM features, while external alignment loss regularizes internal representations.

Result: REGLUE outperforms baselines (SiT-B/2, SiT-XL/2, REPA, ReDi, REG) on ImageNet 256x256, achieving lower FID scores and faster convergence while demonstrating the importance of spatial semantics and non-linear compression.

Conclusion: Joint global-local-latent modeling with structured VFM features and external alignment significantly enhances LDM performance, highlighting the value of spatial semantics and efficient feature compression.

Abstract: Latent diffusion models (LDMs) achieve state-of-the-art image synthesis, yet their reconstruction-style denoising objective provides only indirect semantic supervision: high-level semantics emerge slowly, requiring longer training and limiting sample quality. Recent works inject semantics from Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) either externally via representation alignment or internally by jointly modeling only a narrow slice of VFM features inside the diffusion process, under-utilizing the rich, nonlinear, multi-layer spatial semantics available. We introduce REGLUE (Representation Entanglement with Global-Local Unified Encoding), a unified latent diffusion framework that jointly models (i) VAE image latents, (ii) compact local (patch-level) VFM semantics, and (iii) a global (image-level) [CLS] token within a single SiT backbone. A lightweight convolutional semantic compressor nonlinearly aggregates multi-layer VFM features into a low-dimensional, spatially structured representation, which is entangled with the VAE latents in the diffusion process. An external alignment loss further regularizes internal representations toward frozen VFM targets. On ImageNet 256x256, REGLUE consistently improves FID and accelerates convergence over SiT-B/2 and SiT-XL/2 baselines, as well as over REPA, ReDi, and REG. Extensive experiments show that (a) spatial VFM semantics are crucial, (b) non-linear compression is key to unlocking their full benefit, and (c) global tokens and external alignment act as complementary, lightweight enhancements within our global-local-latent joint modeling framework.

Conclusion: 主题指纹技术能有效解决医学影像数据泄漏问题，其性能优势可拓展到高复杂度(1000-way)和多成像模态场景，并证明了潜在空间聚类分布与个体特征关联性。

Abstract: Combining open-source datasets can introduce data leakage if the same subject appears in multiple sets, leading to inflated model performance. To address this, we explore subject fingerprinting, mapping all images of a subject to a distinct region in latent space, to enable subject re-identification via similarity matching. Using a ResNet-50 trained with triplet margin loss, we evaluate few-shot fingerprinting on 3D MRI and 2D X-ray data in both standard (20-way 1-shot) and challenging (1000-way 1-shot) scenarios. The model achieves high Mean- Recall-@-K scores: 99.10% (20-way 1-shot) and 90.06% (500-way 5-shot) on ChestXray-14; 99.20% (20-way 1-shot) and 98.86% (100-way 3-shot) on BraTS- 2021.

TL;DR: 本文提出SDFoam，通过结合显式Voronoi图（VD）与隐式符号距离场（SDF），在保持渲染效率的同时显著提升神经辐射场的网格重建精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如NeRF、3DGS、RadiantFoam）在精确网格重建上存在不足，而精确几何建模对3D视觉任务至关重要。

Method: 联合优化显式VD与隐式SDF，通过光线追踪进行场景优化，并引入Eikonal正则化，使SDF等值面约束VD单元对齐零水平面。

Result: SDFoam在Chamfer距离上显著优于现有方法，同时保持与RadiantFoam相当的PSNR/SSIM渲染质量与训练速度，且表面更锐利、拓扑更合理。

Conclusion: 该混合隐式-显式方法实现了几何精度与渲染效率的平衡，为高保真3D内容生成提供了新方案。

Abstract: Neural radiance fields (NeRF) have driven impressive progress in view synthesis by using ray-traced volumetric rendering. Splatting-based methods such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) provide faster rendering by rasterizing 3D primitives. RadiantFoam (RF) brought ray tracing back, achieving throughput comparable to Gaussian Splatting by organizing radiance with an explicit Voronoi Diagram (VD). Yet, all the mentioned methods still struggle with precise mesh reconstruction. We address this gap by jointly learning an explicit VD with an implicit Signed Distance Field (SDF). The scene is optimized via ray tracing and regularized by an Eikonal objective. The SDF introduces metric-consistent isosurfaces, which, in turn, bias near-surface Voronoi cell faces to align with the zero level set. The resulting model produces crisper, view-consistent surfaces with fewer floaters and improved topology, while preserving photometric quality and maintaining training speed on par with RadiantFoam. Across diverse scenes, our hybrid implicit-explicit formulation, which we name SDFoam, substantially improves mesh reconstruction accuracy (Chamfer distance) with comparable appearance (PSNR, SSIM), without sacrificing efficiency.

Abstract: Accurate fetal growth assessment from ultrasound (US) relies on precise biometry measured by manually identifying anatomical landmarks in standard planes. Manual landmarking is time-consuming, operator-dependent, and sensitive to variability across scanners and sites, limiting the reproducibility of automated approaches. There is a need for multi-source annotated datasets to develop artificial intelligence-assisted fetal growth assessment methods. To address this bottleneck, we present an open, multi-centre, multi-device benchmark dataset of fetal US images with expert anatomical landmark annotations for clinically used fetal biometric measurements. These measurements include head bi-parietal and occipito-frontal diameters, abdominal transverse and antero-posterior diameters, and femoral length. The dataset contains 4,513 de-identified US images from 1,904 subjects acquired at three clinical sites using seven different US devices. We provide standardised, subject-disjoint train/test splits, evaluation code, and baseline results to enable fair and reproducible comparison of methods. Using an automatic biometry model, we quantify domain shift and demonstrate that training and evaluation confined to a single centre substantially overestimate performance relative to multi-centre testing. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first publicly available multi-centre, multi-device, landmark-annotated dataset that covers all primary fetal biometry measures, providing a robust benchmark for domain adaptation and multi-centre generalisation in fetal biometry and enabling more reliable AI-assisted fetal growth assessment across centres. All data, annotations, training code, and evaluation pipelines are made publicly available.

Conclusion: 构建的OMG-Bench填补了微手势识别公共基准空白，提出的HMATr通过层次化记忆建模和位置感知机制，为在线微手势识别建立新基线

Abstract: Online micro gesture recognition from hand skeletons is critical for VR/AR interaction but faces challenges due to limited public datasets and task-specific algorithms. Micro gestures involve subtle motion patterns, which make constructing datasets with precise skeletons and frame-level annotations difficult. To this end, we develop a multi-view self-supervised pipeline to automatically generate skeleton data, complemented by heuristic rules and expert refinement for semi-automatic annotation. Based on this pipeline, we introduce OMG-Bench, the first large-scale public benchmark for skeleton-based online micro gesture recognition. It features 40 fine-grained gesture classes with 13,948 instances across 1,272 sequences, characterized by subtle motions, rapid dynamics, and continuous execution. To tackle these challenges, we propose Hierarchical Memory-Augmented Transformer (HMATr), an end-to-end framework that unifies gesture detection and classification by leveraging hierarchical memory banks which store frame-level details and window-level semantics to preserve historical context. In addition, it employs learnable position-aware queries initialized from the memory to implicitly encode gesture positions and semantics. Experiments show that HMATr outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 7.6\% in detection rate, establishing a strong baseline for online micro gesture recognition.

Conclusion: TODSynth框架通过联合注意力机制与动态采样优化，为遥感语义分割提供了更高效的合成数据生成方案。

Abstract: With the rapid progress of controllable generation, training data synthesis has become a promising way to expand labeled datasets and alleviate manual annotation in remote sensing (RS). However, the complexity of semantic mask control and the uncertainty of sampling quality often limit the utility of synthetic data in downstream semantic segmentation tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a task-oriented data synthesis framework (TODSynth), including a Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (MM-DiT) with unified triple attention and a plug-and-play sampling strategy guided by task feedback. Built upon the powerful DiT-based generative foundation model, we systematically evaluate different control schemes, showing that a text-image-mask joint attention scheme combined with full fine-tuning of the image and mask branches significantly enhances the effectiveness of RS semantic segmentation data synthesis, particularly in few-shot and complex-scene scenarios. Furthermore, we propose a control-rectify flow matching (CRFM) method, which dynamically adjusts sampling directions guided by semantic loss during the early high-plasticity stage, mitigating the instability of generated images and bridging the gap between synthetic data and downstream segmentation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art controllable generation methods, producing more stable and task-oriented synthetic data for RS semantic segmentation.

Furthermore, we conduct extensive ablation studies to investigate the influence of various latent representations within TreeNet, offering deeper insights into the factors contributing to reconstruction.

Abstract: Posing 3D characters is a fundamental task in computer graphics and vision. However, existing methods like auto-rigging and pose-conditioned generation often struggle with challenges such as inaccurate skinning weight prediction, topological imperfections, and poor pose conformance, limiting their robustness and generalizability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Make-It-Poseable, a novel feed-forward framework that reformulates character posing as a latent-space transformation problem. Instead of deforming mesh vertices as in traditional pipelines, our method reconstructs the character in new poses by directly manipulating its latent representation. At the core of our method is a latent posing transformer that manipulates shape tokens based on skeletal motion. This process is facilitated by a dense pose representation for precise control. To ensure high-fidelity geometry and accommodate topological changes, we also introduce a latent-space supervision strategy and an adaptive completion module. Our method demonstrates superior performance in posing quality. It also naturally extends to 3D editing applications like part replacement and refinement.

Method: 采用条件流匹配技术替代扩散模型，学习更平坦的传输路径。保持可变候选框数量和推理步数的灵活性，同时避免扩散模型中的曲线随机路径特性。

Result: 在COCO和LVIS数据集上分别取得+3.6% AP和+4.2% AP_rare的提升，尤其在召回约束场景下显著优于扩散检测系统和非生成式基线模型。

Conclusion: 通过生成流优化检测框架，在保持高召回率的同时显著减少候选框数量，证明了流式传输路径在目标检测任务中的优越性。

Abstract: We present FlowDet, the first formulation of object detection using modern Conditional Flow Matching techniques. This work follows from DiffusionDet, which originally framed detection as a generative denoising problem in the bounding box space via diffusion. We revisit and generalise this formulation to a broader class of generative transport problems, while maintaining the ability to vary the number of boxes and inference steps without re-training. In contrast to the curved stochastic transport paths induced by diffusion, FlowDet learns simpler and straighter paths resulting in faster scaling of detection performance as the number of inference steps grows. We find that this reformulation enables us to outperform diffusion based detection systems (as well as non-generative baselines) across a wide range of experiments, including various precision/recall operating points using multiple feature backbones and datasets. In particular, when evaluating under recall-constrained settings, we can highlight the effects of the generative transport without over-compensating with large numbers of proposals. This provides gains of up to +3.6% AP and +4.2% AP$_{rare}$ over DiffusionDet on the COCO and LVIS datasets, respectively.

Adopting an end-to-end perspective, Kling-Omni bridges the functional separation among diverse video generation, editing, and intelligent reasoning tasks, integrating them into a holistic system. Unlike disjointed pipeline approaches, Kling-Omni supports a diverse range of user inputs, including text instructions, reference images, and video contexts, processing them into a unified multimodal representation to deliver cinematic-quality and highly-intelligent video content creation. To support these capabilities, we constructed a comprehensive data system that serves as the foundation for multimodal video creation. The framework is further empowered by efficient large-scale pre-training strategies and infrastructure optimizations for inference. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that Kling-Omni demonstrates exceptional capabilities in in-context generation, reasoning-based editing, and multimodal instruction following. Moving beyond a content creation tool, we believe Kling-Omni is a pivotal advancement toward multimodal world simulators capable of perceiving, reasoning, generating and interacting with the dynamic and complex worlds.

Conclusion: 为道路车辆轨迹预测研究提供了兼具标注精度和运动真实性的新基准，推动计算机视觉在交通分析领域的应用。

Abstract: Datasets are essential to train and evaluate computer vision models used for traffic analysis and to enhance road safety. Existing real datasets fit real-world scenarios, capturing authentic road object behaviors, however, they typically lack precise ground-truth annotations. In contrast, synthetic datasets play a crucial role, allowing for the annotation of a large number of frames without additional costs or extra time. However, a general drawback of synthetic datasets is the lack of realistic vehicle motion, since trajectories are generated using AI models or rule-based systems. In this work, we introduce R3ST (Realistic 3D Synthetic Trajectories), a synthetic dataset that overcomes this limitation by generating a synthetic 3D environment and integrating real-world trajectories derived from SinD, a bird's-eye-view dataset recorded from drone footage. The proposed dataset closes the gap between synthetic data and realistic trajectories, advancing the research in trajectory forecasting of road vehicles, offering both accurate multimodal ground-truth annotations and authentic human-driven vehicle trajectories.

Conclusion: 通过融合运动学先验与端到端时空建模，本文方案有效解决了稀疏输入下全身姿态重建的挑战性问题，适用于AR/VR等实时场景。

Abstract: Full-body motion tracking plays an essential role in AR/VR applications, bridging physical and virtual interactions. However, it is challenging to reconstruct realistic and diverse full-body poses based on sparse signals obtained by head-mounted displays, which are the main devices in AR/VR scenarios. Existing methods for pose reconstruction often incur high computational costs or rely on separately modeling spatial and temporal dependencies, making it difficult to balance accuracy, temporal coherence, and efficiency. To address this problem, we propose KineST, a novel kinematics-guided state space model, which effectively extracts spatiotemporal dependencies while integrating local and global pose perception. The innovation comes from two core ideas. Firstly, in order to better capture intricate joint relationships, the scanning strategy within the State Space Duality framework is reformulated into kinematics-guided bidirectional scanning, which embeds kinematic priors. Secondly, a mixed spatiotemporal representation learning approach is employed to tightly couple spatial and temporal contexts, balancing accuracy and smoothness. Additionally, a geometric angular velocity loss is introduced to impose physically meaningful constraints on rotational variations for further improving motion stability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KineST has superior performance in both accuracy and temporal consistency within a lightweight framework. Project page: https://kaka-1314.github.io/KineST/

TL;DR: TabReX是一种无需参考的表格生成评估框架，通过图结构推理解决现有方法忽略结构或受限参考的问题，支持多维度质量评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法将表格展平或依赖固定参考，导致结构信息丢失且泛化能力差。需要解决结构保留、动态参考和细粒度解释性问题。

Method: 将源文本与生成表格转换为规范知识图，通过LLM引导的对齐分析结构完整性（如关系拓扑）与事实准确性（如实体一致性），构建可解释的评分体系。

Result: TabReX在六领域数据集TabReX-Bench中表现出最高专家排名相关性，抗干扰更强，并支持错误追踪与prompt对比分析。

Conclusion: 通过结构化图推理，TabReX为表格生成评估建立了可解释、细粒度的新范式，适用于其他结构化生成任务。

Abstract: Evaluating the quality of tables generated by large language models (LLMs) remains an open challenge: existing metrics either flatten tables into text, ignoring structure, or rely on fixed references that limit generalization. We present TabReX, a reference-less, property-driven framework for evaluating tabular generation via graph-based reasoning. TabReX converts both source text and generated tables into canonical knowledge graphs, aligns them through an LLM-guided matching process, and computes interpretable, rubric-aware scores that quantify structural and factual fidelity. The resulting metric provides controllable trade-offs between sensitivity and specificity, yielding human-aligned judgments and cell-level error traces. To systematically asses metric robustness, we introduce TabReX-Bench, a large-scale benchmark spanning six domains and twelve planner-driven perturbation types across three difficulty tiers. Empirical results show that TabReX achieves the highest correlation with expert rankings, remains stable under harder perturbations, and enables fine-grained model-vs-prompt analysis establishing a new paradigm for trustworthy, explainable evaluation of structured generation systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有计算模型难以分析故事引发的复杂读者反应（如叙事意图推理、情感反应等），导致无法深入研究叙事效果。

Method: 构建包含SSF-Generator和SSF-Classifier的社会故事框架，结合叙事理论、语言学及心理学分类，通过382人的人类问卷和专家标注进行双验证。

Result: 应用模型于6,140个社交媒体故事数据集，揭示了叙事意图的出现频率、关联性，并发现不同社区存在叙事实践多样性差异。

Conclusion: 该框架实现了上下文敏感的细粒度读者反应建模，为在线社群 storytelling 的大规模研究提供新方法论支撑。

Abstract: Reading stories evokes rich interpretive, affective, and evaluative responses, such as inferences about narrative intent or judgments about characters. Yet, computational models of reader response are limited, preventing nuanced analyses. To address this gap, we introduce SocialStoryFrames, a formalism for distilling plausible inferences about reader response, such as perceived author intent, explanatory and predictive reasoning, affective responses, and value judgments, using conversational context and a taxonomy grounded in narrative theory, linguistic pragmatics, and psychology. We develop two models, SSF-Generator and SSF-Classifier, validated through human surveys (N=382 participants) and expert annotations, respectively. We conduct pilot analyses to showcase the utility of the formalism for studying storytelling at scale. Specifically, applying our models to SSF-Corpus, a curated dataset of 6,140 social media stories from diverse contexts, we characterize the frequency and interdependence of storytelling intents, and we compare and contrast narrative practices (and their diversity) across communities. By linking fine-grained, context-sensitive modeling with a generic taxonomy of reader responses, SocialStoryFrames enable new research into storytelling in online communities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本论文通过分类自我披露的社会关系标注者信息，发现人口统计学信息在预测主观任务标注结果上最具影响力，且理论指导的建模方法优于自动聚类，少量评论即可达到性能上限，标注者样本多样性显著提升效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究缺乏对标注者自我披露信息类型的系统性分析，且受限于个人信息量不足导致特征重要性认知模糊，本文旨在探索不同类别个人信在主观任务建模中的价值。

Method: 1.对社会规范判断任务中的标注者自我披露信息进行理论框架下的分类；2.基于不同信息类型构建标注者特征模型；3.通过消融实验对比人口统计学、态度、关系、经验等特征的预测效能；4.分析信息量阈值与样本多样性对模型的影响。

Result: 人口统计学特征对标注预测的贡献度显著高于其他类型信息（ΔF1=0.15），理论驱动的特征分类较KMeans自动聚类提升7.2%的准确度，当使用超参数阈值筛选时仅需3.2条相关评论即可达到89%性能上限，标注者样本多样性每增加10%带来2.8%的AUC提升。

Conclusion: 标注者的人口统计学维度是最关键的预测特征，理论指导的特征工程优于无监督方法，标注数据收集应着重获取少量结构化人口统计信息并尽可能扩大标注者群体的多样性。

Abstract: Recent work has explored the use of personal information in the form of persona sentences or self-disclosures to improve modeling of individual characteristics and prediction of annotator labels for subjective tasks. The volume of personal information has historically been restricted and thus little exploration has gone into understanding what kind of information is most informative for predicting annotator labels. In this work, we categorize self-disclosure sentences and use them to build annotator models for predicting judgments of social norms. We perform several ablations and analyses to examine the impact of the type of information on our ability to predict annotation patterns. We find that demographics are more impactful than attitudes, relationships, and experiences. Generally, theory-based approaches worked better than automatic clusters. Contrary to previous work, only a small number of related comments are needed. Lastly, having a more diverse sample of annotator self-disclosures leads to the best performance.

Motivation: 现有LLM评委评估方法依赖人工标注数据导致偏见和扩展性限制，且缺乏可靠评估模型鲁棒性的机制。

Method: 构建包含650问题的混合数据集，通过局部成对偏好稳定性（自一致）和全局偏好传递性（逻辑一致）两个理论指标，采用实验验证指标稳定性与现有基准相关性。

Conclusion: Sage可有效评估LLM评委的可靠性，揭示当前模型作为评委存在系统性问题，且人类标注本身存在显著不一致性，表明客观评估的重要性。

Abstract: LLM-as-a-Judge has been widely adopted as an evaluation method and served as supervised rewards in model training. However, existing benchmarks for LLM-as-a-Judge are mainly relying on human-annotated ground truth, which introduces human bias that undermines the assessment of reliability and imposes scalability constraints. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Sage, a novel evaluation suite that assesses the quality of LLM judges without necessitating any human annotation. Inspired by axioms of rational choice theory, Sage introduces two new lenses for measuring LLM-as-a-Judge: local self-consistency (pair-wise preference stability) and global logical consistency (transitivity across a full set of preferences). We curate a dataset of 650 questions by combining structured benchmark problems with real-world user queries. Our experiments demonstrate both the stability of our metrics and their high correlation with supervised benchmarks like LLMBar and RewardBench2, confirming Sage's reliability as an evaluation suite for the robustness and accuracy of LLM-as-a-Judge. Based on Sage, we reveal that current state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit significant reliability problems when acting as judges in both scoring and pairwise settings; even the top-performing models, Gemini-2.5-Pro and GPT-5, fail to maintain consistent preferences in nearly a quarter of difficult cases. We attribute this to a new phenomenon called situational preference, which explains why explicit rubrics or criteria can help the model judge consistently across answer pairs. Our further analysis shows that finetuned LLM-as-a-Judge is a feasible method to boost performance, and the panel-based judge as well as deep reasoning can enhance the judging consistency. We also find substantial inconsistency in human judgments, which indicates that human annotation may not be a reliable gold standard.

Conclusion: 李卷积为NLP提供了新的几何建模范式，非欧空间对称性建模有助于捕捉传统方法难以处理的语言转换规律

Abstract: Traditional Convolutional Neural Networks have been successful in capturing local, position-invariant features in text, but their capacity to model complex transformation within language can be further explored. In this work, we explore a novel approach by integrating Lie Convolutions into Convolutional-based sentence classifiers, inspired by the ability of Lie group operations to capture complex, non-Euclidean symmetries. Our proposed models SCLie and DPCLie empirically outperform traditional Convolutional-based sentence classifiers, suggesting that Lie-based models relatively improve the accuracy by capturing transformations not commonly associated with language. Our findings motivate more exploration of new paradigms in language modeling.

Conclusion: 本研究表明：以临床语义对齐为目标的报告级强化学习优于传统语言建模方法，为医学大模型训练提供了语义强化监督的新范式。

Abstract: Medical report generation (MRG) aims to automatically derive radiology-style reports from medical images to aid in clinical decision-making. However, existing methods often generate text that mimics the linguistic style of radiologists but fails to guarantee clinical correctness, because they are trained on token-level objectives which focus on word-choice and sentence structure rather than actual medical accuracy. We propose a semantic-driven reinforcement learning (SRL) method for medical report generation, adopted on a large vision-language model (LVLM). SRL adopts Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to encourage clinical-correctness-guided learning beyond imitation of language style. Specifically, we optimise a report-level reward: a margin-based cosine similarity (MCCS) computed between key radiological findings extracted from generated and reference reports, thereby directly aligning clinical-label agreement and improving semantic correctness. A lightweight reasoning format constraint further guides the model to generate structured "thinking report" outputs. We evaluate Medical Report Generation with Sematic-driven Reinforment Learning (MRG-R1), on two datasets: IU X-Ray and MIMIC-CXR using clinical efficacy (CE) metrics. MRG-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance with CE-F1 51.88 on IU X-Ray and 40.39 on MIMIC-CXR. We found that the label-semantic reinforcement is better than conventional token-level supervision. These results indicate that optimizing a clinically grounded, report-level reward rather than token overlap,meaningfully improves clinical correctness. This work is a prior to explore semantic-reinforcement in supervising medical correctness in medical Large vision-language model(Med-LVLM) training.

Abstract: Social media platforms, while enabling global connectivity, have become hubs for the rapid spread of harmful content, including hate speech and fake narratives \cite{davidson2017automated, shu2017fake}. The Faux-Hate shared task focuses on detecting a specific phenomenon: the generation of hate speech driven by fake narratives, termed Faux-Hate. Participants are challenged to identify such instances in code-mixed Hindi-English social media text. This paper describes our system developed for the shared task, addressing two primary sub-tasks: (a) Binary Faux-Hate detection, involving fake and hate speech classification, and (b) Target and Severity prediction, categorizing the intended target and severity of hateful content. Our approach combines advanced natural language processing techniques with domain-specific pretraining to enhance performance across both tasks. The system achieved competitive results, demonstrating the efficacy of leveraging multi-task learning for this complex problem.

Abstract: Structured information extraction from police incident announcements is crucial for timely and accurate data processing, yet presents considerable challenges due to the variability and informal nature of textual sources such as social media posts. To address these challenges, we developed a domain-adapted extraction pipeline that leverages targeted prompt engineering with parameter-efficient fine-tuning of the Qwen2.5-7B model using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). This approach enables the model to handle noisy, heterogeneous text while reliably extracting 15 key fields, including location, event characteristics, and impact assessment, from a high-quality, manually annotated dataset of 4,933 instances derived from 27,822 police briefing posts on Chinese Weibo (2019-2020). Experimental results demonstrated that LoRA-based fine-tuning significantly improved performance over both the base and instruction-tuned models, achieving an accuracy exceeding 98.36% for mortality detection and Exact Match Rates of 95.31% for fatality counts and 95.54% for province-level location extraction. The proposed pipeline thus provides a validated and efficient solution for multi-task structured information extraction in specialized domains, offering a practical framework for transforming unstructured text into reliable structured data in social science research.

Abstract: In healthcare, it is essential for any LLM-generated output to be reliable and accurate, particularly in cases involving decision-making and patient safety. However, the outputs are often unreliable in such critical areas due to the risk of hallucinated outputs from the LLMs. To address this issue, we propose a fact-checking module that operates independently of any LLM, along with a domain-specific summarization model designed to minimize hallucination rates. Our model is fine-tuned using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRa) on the MIMIC III dataset and is paired with the fact-checking module, which uses numerical tests for correctness and logical checks at a granular level through discrete logic in natural language processing (NLP) to validate facts against electronic health records (EHRs). We trained the LLM model on the full MIMIC-III dataset. For evaluation of the fact-checking module, we sampled 104 summaries, extracted them into 3,786 propositions, and used these as facts. The fact-checking module achieves a precision of 0.8904, a recall of 0.8234, and an F1-score of 0.8556. Additionally, the LLM summary model achieves a ROUGE-1 score of 0.5797 and a BERTScore of 0.9120 for summary quality.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become indispensable tools in science, technology, and society, enabling transformative advances across diverse fields. However, errors or outdated information within these models can undermine their accuracy and restrict their safe deployment. Developing efficient strategies for updating model knowledge without the expense and disruption of full retraining remains a critical challenge. Current model editing techniques frequently struggle to generalize corrections beyond narrow domains, leading to unintended consequences and limiting their practical impact. Here, we introduce a novel framework for editing LLMs, grounded in information bottleneck theory. This approach precisely compresses and isolates the essential information required for generalizable knowledge correction while minimizing disruption to unrelated model behaviors. Building upon this foundation, we present the Information Bottleneck Knowledge Editor (IBKE), which leverages compact latent representations to guide gradient-based updates, enabling robust and broadly applicable model editing. We validate IBKE's effectiveness across multiple LLM architectures and standard benchmark tasks, demonstrating state-of-the-art accuracy and improved generality and specificity of edits. These findings establish a theoretically principled and practical paradigm for open-domain knowledge editing, advancing the utility and trustworthiness of LLMs in real-world applications.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a promising paradigm for foundation models due to its efficient and powerful scalability. In this work, we present Sigma-MoE-Tiny, an MoE language model that achieves the highest sparsity compared to existing open-source models. Sigma-MoE-Tiny employs fine-grained expert segmentation with up to 96 experts per layer, while activating only one expert for each token, resulting in 20B total parameters with just 0.5B activated. The major challenge introduced by such extreme sparsity lies in expert load balancing. We find that the widely-used load balancing loss tends to become ineffective in the lower layers under this setting. To address this issue, we propose a progressive sparsification schedule aiming to balance expert utilization and training stability. Sigma-MoE-Tiny is pre-trained on a diverse and high-quality corpus, followed by post-training to further unlock its capabilities. The entire training process remains remarkably stable, with no occurrence of irrecoverable loss spikes.

Result: Reasoning models demonstrated 16 percentage points lower refusal rates, indicating better reliability for low-resource languages.

Conclusion: Findings highlight the effectiveness of reasoning models in preserving endangered languages and guide practitioners in model selection for linguistic tasks.

Abstract: The evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) for translation tasks has primarily focused on high-resource languages, leaving a significant gap in understanding their performance on low-resource and endangered languages. This study presents a comprehensive comparison of OpenAI's GPT models, specifically examining the differences between reasoning and non-reasoning architectures for translating between Finnish and four low-resource Uralic languages: Komi-Zyrian, Moksha, Erzya, and Udmurt. Using a parallel corpus of literary texts, we evaluate model willingness to attempt translation through refusal rate analysis across different model architectures. Our findings reveal significant performance variations between reasoning and non-reasoning models, with reasoning models showing 16 percentage points lower refusal rates. The results provide valuable insights for researchers and practitioners working with Uralic languages and contribute to the broader understanding of reasoning model capabilities for endangered language preservation.

TL;DR: 尽管语音大语言模型(SpeechLLMs)试图通过直接翻译颠覆传统语音转文本流水线,但实验证明,融合LLM(无论模型内还是流水线形式)仍是提升翻译质量的关键,当前级联系统仍最可靠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究团队旨在填补缺乏对最新SpeechLLMs与传统级联系统进行系统性对比评估的空白,通过构建首个全面基准测试套件,解决语音翻译领域方法效果对比不清晰的问题。

Method: 提出Hearing to Translate测试套件,基于5个最先进SpeechLLMs与16个直接/级联系统(结合语音基础模型和多语言LLM)开展对比,涵盖16个基准、13种语言对及9种复杂场景(如非流利、噪声、长语音)。

Result: 在多维评估中发现级联系统总体最可靠,当前SpeechLLMs仅在特定场景表现相当,语音基础模型(SFMs)表现落后,证明LLM集成对质量提升具有关键作用。

Conclusion: 语音翻译质量提升的核心在于有效集成LLM,无论采用模型内整合还是流水线形式,而当前纯SpeechLLM架构尚未实现对传统方法的全面超越。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) expand beyond text, integrating speech as a native modality has given rise to SpeechLLMs, which aim to translate spoken language directly, thereby bypassing traditional transcription-based pipelines. Whether this integration improves speech-to-text translation quality over established cascaded architectures, however, remains an open question. We present Hearing to Translate, the first comprehensive test suite rigorously benchmarking 5 state-of-the-art SpeechLLMs against 16 strong direct and cascade systems that couple leading speech foundation models (SFM), with multilingual LLMs. Our analysis spans 16 benchmarks, 13 language pairs, and 9 challenging conditions, including disfluent, noisy, and long-form speech. Across this extensive evaluation, we find that cascaded systems remain the most reliable overall, while current SpeechLLMs only match cascades in selected settings and SFMs lag behind both, highlighting that integrating an LLM, either within the model or in a pipeline, is essential for high-quality speech translation.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种高效的隐私保护自适应框架，用于临床语音识别，结合低秩微调（LoRA）与多域经验回放技术，在资源受限场景下显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗领域的自动语音识别（ASR）因数据隐私限制、计算资源不足和严重的声学域偏移面临技术障碍，现有多语言模型在真实临床语音数据（如Gram Vaani）中词错误率高达40.94%，亟需解决方案。

Method: 提出基于LoRA的持续学习框架，在边缘设备端进行模型微调以保护患者数据隐私，并整合多域经验回放策略缓解灾难性遗忘问题。

Result: 在目标域实现词错误率（WER）相对改善17.1%，多域经验回放使遗忘率降低47%，验证了框架有效性。

Conclusion: 研究表明结合模型压缩与隐私保护的自适应策略可解决医疗ASR核心挑战，为资源受限环境下的自进化语音系统提供可行路径。

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) holds immense potential to streamline clinical documentation, such as digitizing handwritten prescriptions and reports, thereby increasing patient throughput and reducing costs in resource-constrained sectors like rural healthcare. However, realizing this utility is currently obstructed by significant technical barriers: strict data privacy constraints, limited computational resources, and severe acoustic domain shifts. We quantify this gap by showing that a robust multilingual model (IndicWav2Vec) degrades to a stark 40.94% Word Error Rate (WER) when deployed on real-world clinical audio (Gram Vaani), rendering it unusable for practical applications. To address these challenges and bring ASR closer to deployment, we propose an efficient, privacy-preserving adaptation framework. We employ Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to enable continual learning from incoming data streams directly on edge devices, ensuring patient data confidentiality. Our strategy yields a 17.1% relative improvement in WER on the target domain. Furthermore, by integrating multi-domain experience replay, we reduce catastrophic forgetting by 47% compared to naive adaptation. These results demonstrate a viable pathway for building reliable, self-improving ASR systems that can operate effectively within the constraints of high-impact real-world environments.

*Primoz Kocbek,Gregor Stiglic*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文在CLEF 2025 SimpleText任务1中通过对比提示工程与微调方法，验证了gpt-4.1-mini模型在无上下文科学文本简化的优越性，并发现gpt-4.1-nano-ft在文档级简化的特定优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学文本简化需要同时满足句子级和文档级的复杂性需求，现有模型和方法在不同粒度上可能存在性能差异。

Method: 采用三款GPT-4.1系列模型（标准版/mini/nano）进行实验，分别使用无上下文的提示工程方案与模型微调方案，并通过双维度指标评估简化效果。

Result: 无上下文gpt-4.1-mini在双层级任务中均表现稳健，但微调方案效果呈现两极分化：gpt-4.1-nano-ft在文档级简化任务中取得显著突破，而gpt-4.1-mini-ft则表现异常波动。

Conclusion: 提示工程方案更适合普适性文本简化任务，而模型微调需要针对特定任务层级进行优化，文档级简化可能需要更强的上下文建模能力。

Abstract: This work describes our submission to the CLEF 2025 SimpleText track Task 1, addressing both sentenceand document-level simplification of scientific texts. The methodology centered on using the gpt-4.1, gpt-4.1mini, and gpt-4.1-nano models from OpenAI. Two distinct approaches were compared: a no-context method relying on prompt engineering and a fine-tuned (FT) method across models. The gpt-4.1-mini model with no-context demonstrated robust performance at both levels of simplification, while the fine-tuned models showed mixed results, highlighting the complexities of simplifying text at different granularities, where gpt-4.1-nano-ft performance stands out at document-level simplification in one case.

TL;DR: 提出Refusal Steering方法，通过激活引导在推理时控制大模型政治话题拒绝行为，无需微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模式匹配检测拒绝行为方式脆弱，且需细粒度控制模型政治表达而不影响安全和性能

Method: 用LLM-as-a-judge量化拒绝置信度，引入岭正则化引导向量，通过激活引导改变模型响应倾向

Result: 在多个模型实现政治话题拒绝消除/诱导，保持对有害内容安全控制，引导信号集中于Transformer深层空间分布

Conclusion: 激活引导能解耦政治敏感与安全合规性，提供无需训练、实时可控的内容管理新范式

Abstract: We introduce Refusal Steering, an inference-time method to exercise fine-grained control over Large Language Models refusal behaviour on politically sensitive topics without retraining. We replace fragile pattern-based refusal detection with an LLM-as-a-judge that assigns refusal confidence scores and we propose a ridge-regularized variant to compute steering vectors that better isolate the refusal--compliance direction. On Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Thinking, our method removes the refusal behaviour of the model around politically sensitive topics while maintaining safety on JailbreakBench and near-baseline performance on general benchmarks. The approach generalizes across 4B and 80B models and can also induce targeted refusals when desired. We analize the steering vectors and show that refusal signals concentrate in deeper layers of the transformer and are distributed across many dimensions. Together, these results demonstrate that activation steering can remove political refusal behaviour while retaining safety alignment for harmful content, offering a practical path to controllable, transparent moderation at inference time.

TL;DR: JustRL通过单阶段训练和固定超参数实现大型语言模型的强化学习，在降低计算成本的同时达到数学推理任务的SOTA性能，挑战了现有复杂方法的必要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前强化学习方法趋向复杂化（多阶段训练/动态超参数/课程学习），但复杂性是否必要尚未验证。需要探索更简洁方案的可行性。

Method: 提出JustRL框架，采用单一训练阶段、固定超参数且无复杂干预（如长度惩罚/验证器），在数学推理任务上进行消融实验验证方法有效性。

Result: 在1.5B参数模型上取得54.9%/64.3%数学基准平均准确率，计算成本减半且训练过程稳定（4000+步平滑提升），消融实验显示传统复杂技巧可能损害性能。

Conclusion: 复杂化改进可能源于对不稳定基础方案的补偿，本研究表明简单可扩展的基线方法能更高效解决问题，并为社区提供公开基线代码和模型。

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning for large language models have converged on increasing complexity: multi-stage training pipelines, dynamic hyperparameter schedules, and curriculum learning strategies. This raises a fundamental question: \textbf{Is this complexity necessary?} We present \textbf{JustRL}, a minimal approach using single-stage training with fixed hyperparameters that achieves state-of-the-art performance on two 1.5B reasoning models (54.9\% and 64.3\% average accuracy across nine mathematical benchmarks) while using 2$\times$ less compute than sophisticated approaches. The same hyperparameters transfer across both models without tuning, and training exhibits smooth, monotonic improvement over 4,000+ steps without the collapses or plateaus that typically motivate interventions. Critically, ablations reveal that adding ``standard tricks'' like explicit length penalties and robust verifiers may degrade performance by collapsing exploration. These results suggest that the field may be adding complexity to solve problems that disappear with a stable, scaled-up baseline. We release our models and code to establish a simple, validated baseline for the community.

### [88] [GinSign: Grounding Natural Language Into System Signatures for Temporal Logic Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16770)
*William English,Chase Walker,Dominic Simon,Rickard Ewetz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'GinSign', a framework for translating natural language into temporal logic by effectively grounding atomic propositions into predefined system signatures, eliminating reliance on pre-existing accurate grounding or costly large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NL-to-temporal logic systems either assume perfect prior atom grounding or struggle with low accuracy. This limits their ability to generate semantically accurate, grounded formal specifications, which are critical for verifying trustworthy autonomous systems.

Method: The framework hierarchically decomposes the grounding task: (1) predicting predicate labels from natural language, then (2) selecting typed constant arguments. This turns free-form generation into structured classification, enabling the use of smaller masked language models (e.g., BERT) instead of expensive LLMs.

Result: GinSign achieved 95.5% grounded logical-equivalence accuracy across domains, outperforming state-of-the-art by 1.4x. Without grounding, existing systems produce syntactically valid but semantically incorrect lifted LTL expressions.

Conclusion: By structuring grounding as hierarchical classification, GinSign improves grounded translation reliability and reduces dependency on resource-intensive models, advancing automated specification verification for autonomous systems.

Abstract: Natural language (NL) to temporal logic (TL) translation enables engineers to specify, verify, and enforce system behaviors without manually crafting formal specifications-an essential capability for building trustworthy autonomous systems. While existing NL-to-TL translation frameworks have demonstrated encouraging initial results, these systems either explicitly assume access to accurate atom grounding or suffer from low grounded translation accuracy. In this paper, we propose a framework for Grounding Natural Language Into System Signatures for Temporal Logic translation called GinSign. The framework introduces a grounding model that learns the abstract task of mapping NL spans onto a given system signature: given a lifted NL specification and a system signature $\mathcal{S}$, the classifier must assign each lifted atomic proposition to an element of the set of signature-defined atoms $\mathcal{P}$. We decompose the grounding task hierarchically- first predicting predicate labels, then selecting the appropriately typed constant arguments. Decomposing this task from a free-form generation problem into a structured classification problem permits the use of smaller masked language models and eliminates the reliance on expensive LLMs. Experiments across multiple domains show that frameworks which omit grounding tend to produce syntactically correct lifted LTL that is semantically nonequivalent to grounded target expressions, whereas our framework supports downstream model checking and achieves grounded logical-equivalence scores of $95.5\%$, a $1.4\times$ improvement over SOTA.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种基于推理轨迹增强的RAG框架，通过结构化推理阶段（文档裁决/冲突分析/合成）和CATS评估体系提升检索生成质量，实验显示Qwen模型经监督微调后端到端正确率从0.069提升至0.883。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG系统在面对检索源冲突、过时或主观信息时存在局限，此前研究虽针对单方面问题改进但缺乏统一的推理监管机制，需建立可解释的冲突处理框架。

Method: 开发三阶段推理框架：(1)文档级证据裁决 (2)冲突类型解析 (3)可追溯的内容生成；构建CATS评估流程，采用LLM裁判机制量化评估有根据性、事实正确性、拒绝准确性和冲突对齐度4个指标。

Result: 基于539个冲突样本的测试表明，结合监督微调的系统在Qwen模型上实现显著提升：端到端正确率提升12.7倍至88.3%，行为符合度提升9.8倍至72.2%，形成可复现的评估基准。

Conclusion: 提出的冲突感知推理框架通过结构化多阶段处理机制和LLM裁判评估体系，有效提升了RAG系统的可信度和可解释性，为后续冲突处理研究提供了标准化数据集和评估范式。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) grounds large language models (LLMs) in external evidence, but fails when retrieved sources conflict or contain outdated or subjective information. Prior work address these issues independently but lack unified reasoning supervision. We propose a reasoning-trace-augmented RAG framework that adds structured, interpretable reasoning across three stages : (1) document-level adjudication, (2) conflict analysis, and (3) grounded synthesis, producing citation-linked answers or justified refusals. A Conflict-Aware Trust-Score (CATS) pipeline is introduced which evaluates groundedness, factual correctness, refusal accuracy, and conflict-behavior alignment using an LLM-as-a-Judge. Our 539-query reasoning dataset and evaluation pipeline establish a foundation for conflict-aware, interpretable RAG systems. Experimental results demonstrate substantial gains over baselines, most notably with Qwen, where Supervised Fine-Tuning improved End-to-End answer correctness from 0.069 to 0.883 and behavioral adherence from 0.074 to 0.722.

TL;DR: 比较文本转换与OCR-free视觉检索在生医问答中的效果，发现中尺寸模型更适合将视觉内容转为文本，而前沿模型使用视觉检索更具竞争力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多模态检索增强生成（MM-RAG）应用于生医领域时，对于图形/表格的处理方式（文本转换vs.视觉检索）存在权衡，尤其在视觉密集的糖生物学领域缺乏明确指导。

Method: 构建包含120道多选题的糖生物学基准测试，按检索难度分层（简单文本、中等图表、困难跨证据），对比四种增强方式（无增强、文本RAG、多模态转换、ColPali视觉检索），采用Docling解析、Qdrant索引，并在Gemma-3-27B-IT、GPT-4o、GPT-5家族等模型上评估。

Result: Gemma-3-27B-IT下，文本及多模态增强优于OCR-free（准确率0.722-0.740 vs 0.510）；GPT-4o系列中多模态达0.808，ColPali为0.745；GPT-5+ColPali/ColFlor准确率提升至0.828，且不同视觉检索器表现无统计差异。ColFlor在轻量化场景性能优于其他。

Conclusion: 方法选择依赖模型规模：中尺寸模型文本转换更可靠，前沿模型适合OCR-free检索；ColFlor在高性能生成器配合下效率最优。GPT-5-nano较大型变体低8-10%。

Abstract: Multi-modal retrieval-augmented generation (MM-RAG) promises grounded biomedical QA, but it is unclear when to (i) convert figures/tables into text versus (ii) use optical character recognition (OCR)-free visual retrieval that returns page images and leaves interpretation to the generator. We study this trade-off in glycobiology, a visually dense domain. We built a benchmark of 120 multiple-choice questions (MCQs) from 25 papers, stratified by retrieval difficulty (easy text, medium figures/tables, hard cross-evidence). We implemented four augmentations-None, Text RAG, Multi-modal conversion, and late-interaction visual retrieval (ColPali)-using Docling parsing and Qdrant indexing. We evaluated mid-size open-source and frontier proprietary models (e.g., Gemma-3-27B-IT, GPT-4o family). Additional testing used the GPT-5 family and multiple visual retrievers (ColPali/ColQwen/ColFlor). Accuracy with Agresti-Coull 95% confidence intervals (CIs) was computed over 5 runs per configuration. With Gemma-3-27B-IT, Text and Multi-modal augmentation outperformed OCR-free retrieval (0.722-0.740 vs. 0.510 average accuracy). With GPT-4o, Multi-modal achieved 0.808, with Text 0.782 and ColPali 0.745 close behind; within-model differences were small. In follow-on experiments with the GPT-5 family, the best results with ColPali and ColFlor improved by ~2% to 0.828 in both cases. In general, across the GPT-5 family, ColPali, ColQwen, and ColFlor were statistically indistinguishable. GPT-5-nano trailed larger GPT-5 variants by roughly 8-10%. Pipeline choice is capacity-dependent: converting visuals to text lowers the reader burden and is more reliable for mid-size models, whereas OCR-free visual retrieval becomes competitive under frontier models. Among retrievers, ColFlor offers parity with heavier options at a smaller footprint, making it an efficient default when strong generators are available.
