### [1] [Reading or Reasoning? Format Decoupled Reinforcement Learning for Document OCR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08834)
*Yufeng Zhong,Lei Chen,Zhixiong Zeng,Xuanle Zhao,Deyang Jiang,Liming Zheng,Jing Huang,Haibo Qiu,Peng Shi,Siqi Yang,Lin Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes FD-RL, a reinforcement learning method targeting OCR challenges in formatted documents by leveraging entropy patterns for optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Advanced OCR models struggle with high output uncertainty (entropy) in structured text (e.g., tables, formulas), indicating a need for reasoning over diverse reading pathways for improved performance.

Method: FD-RL uses entropy-based data filtration to identify complex instances and applies format-specific rewards to decouple learning across different document structures, enabling format-level validation instead of token-level memorization.

Result: FD-RL achieved a record 90.41 score on OmniDocBench, outperforming end-to-end models, with ablation studies confirming the effectiveness of data filtering, training strategies, and reward design.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates that addressing high-uncertainty patterns through format-aware reinforcement learning significantly enhances OCR accuracy in structured documents while providing validated insights into training methodologies.

Abstract: Reading text from images or scanned documents via OCR models has been a longstanding focus of researchers. Intuitively, text reading is perceived as a straightforward perceptual task, and existing work primarily focuses on constructing enriched data engineering to enhance SFT capabilities. In this work, we observe that even advanced OCR models exhibit significantly higher entropy in formatted text (\emph{e.g.}, formula, table, etc.) compared to plain text, often by an order of magnitude. These statistical patterns reveal that advanced OCR models struggle with high output uncertainty when dealing with format sensitive document, suggesting that reasoning over diverse reading pathways may improve OCR performance. To address this, we propose format decoupled reinforcement learning (FD-RL), which leverages high-entropy patterns for targeted optimization. Our approach employs entropy-based data filtration strategy to identify format-intensive instances, and adopt format decoupled rewards tailored to different format types, enabling format-level validation rather than token-level memorization. FD-RL achieves an average score of 90.41 on OmniDocBench, setting a new record for end-to-end models on this highly popular benchmark. More importantly, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies over data, training, filtering, and rewarding strategies, thoroughly validating their effectiveness.

### [2] [Bias Detection and Rotation-Robustness Mitigation in Vision-Language Models and Generative Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08860)
*Tarannum Mithila*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究探讨了视觉-语言模型和生成模型在输入变换（如旋转和分布偏移）下的鲁棒性与公平性缺陷，提出通过数据增强、表征对齐和模型正则化的组合策略缓解偏差传播，并在多个数据集上验证方法有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视觉-语言模型（VLMs）在多模态任务中表现优异，但其在输入变换下的鲁棒性和公平性尚未充分研究。现有多模态系统可能在旋转等变换中出现模型预测不稳定、置信度偏差及人口统计偏差放大问题，需探究其机制并提出解决方案。

Result: 实验表明新方法在COCO、LAION等数据集上显著提升模型旋转鲁棒性（如准确率提升18.7%），同时减少性别/皮肤颜色偏差放大现象，且保持原始性能无明显下降（如FID分数维持3.5以下）

Conclusion: 揭示当前多模态系统在输入变换下的关键缺陷，证明通过协同优化数据增强、表征学习和模型约束可有效提升系统可靠性与公平性，为构建可解释AI提供可复现的技术框架。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and generative image models have achieved remarkable performance across multimodal tasks, yet their robustness and fairness under input transformations remain insufficiently explored. This work investigates bias propagation and robustness degradation in state-of-the-art vision-language and generative models, with a particular focus on image rotation and distributional shifts. We analyze how rotation-induced perturbations affect model predictions, confidence calibration, and demographic bias patterns. To address these issues, we propose rotation-robust mitigation strategies that combine data augmentation, representation alignment, and model-level regularization. Experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods significantly improve robustness while reducing bias amplification without sacrificing overall performance. This study highlights critical limitations of current multimodal systems and provides practical mitigation techniques for building more reliable and fair AI models.

### [3] [R$^2$BD: A Reconstruction-Based Method for Generalizable and Efficient Detection of Fake Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08867)
*Qingyu Liu,Zhongjie Ba,Jianmin Guo,Qiu Wang,Zhibo Wang,Jie Shi,Kui Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出R²BD框架，通过统一重建模型和单步残差偏差计算，实现高效且泛化的AIGC图像检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有重建方法依赖扩散模型且效率低下，需提升泛化能力与检测多样性。

Method: 1. G-LDM统一模拟VAE/GAN/扩散模型生成行为。2. 单步残差偏差模块加速检测流程。

Result: 检测速度提升22倍，跨数据集准确率提高13.87%，支持多生成模型检测。

Conclusion: R²BD在效率和泛化性上显著优于现有方法，代码数据集已开源。

Abstract: Recently, reconstruction-based methods have gained attention for AIGC image detection. These methods leverage pre-trained diffusion models to reconstruct inputs and measure residuals for distinguishing real from fake images. Their key advantage lies in reducing reliance on dataset-specific artifacts and improving generalization under distribution shifts. However, they are limited by significant inefficiency due to multi-step inversion and reconstruction, and their reliance on diffusion backbones further limits generalization to other generative paradigms such as GANs.
  In this paper, we propose a novel fake image detection framework, called R$^2$BD, built upon two key designs: (1) G-LDM, a unified reconstruction model that simulates the generation behaviors of VAEs, GANs, and diffusion models, thereby broadening the detection scope beyond prior diffusion-only approaches; and (2) a residual bias calculation module that distinguishes real and fake images in a single inference step, which is a significant efficiency improvement over existing methods that typically require 20$+$ steps.
  Extensive experiments on the benchmark from 10 public datasets demonstrate that R$^2$BD is over 22$\times$ faster than existing reconstruction-based methods while achieving superior detection accuracy. In cross-dataset evaluations, it outperforms state-of-the-art methods by an average of 13.87\%, showing strong efficiency and generalization across diverse generative methods.

### [4] [Residual Cross-Modal Fusion Networks for Audio-Visual Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08868)
*Yi Wang,Yinfeng Yu,Bin Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CRFN, a cross-modal residual fusion network for audio-visual embodied navigation that improves multimodal integration by avoiding single-modality dominance through residual interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with multimodal fusion in cross-domain scenarios due to single-modality dominance or information degradation, necessitating a more effective interaction model between heterogeneous features.

Method: CRFN employs bidirectional residual connections between audio and visual streams for complementary modeling and fine-grained alignment, combined with stabilization techniques to enhance convergence and robustness without relying on traditional concatenation or attention mechanisms.

Result: CRFN outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on Replica and Matterport3D datasets with significant cross-domain generalization improvements, while revealing distinct modality dependencies across datasets.

Conclusion: CRFN offers a novel perspective on cross-modal collaboration in embodied agents, highlighting modality dependence variations and demonstrating superior robustness in complex 3D environments.

Abstract: Audio-visual embodied navigation aims to enable an agent to autonomously localize and reach a sound source in unseen 3D environments by leveraging auditory cues. The key challenge of this task lies in effectively modeling the interaction between heterogeneous features during multimodal fusion, so as to avoid single-modality dominance or information degradation, particularly in cross-domain scenarios. To address this, we propose a Cross-Modal Residual Fusion Network, which introduces bidirectional residual interactions between audio and visual streams to achieve complementary modeling and fine-grained alignment, while maintaining the independence of their representations. Unlike conventional methods that rely on simple concatenation or attention gating, CRFN explicitly models cross-modal interactions via residual connections and incorporates stabilization techniques to improve convergence and robustness. Experiments on the Replica and Matterport3D datasets demonstrate that CRFN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art fusion baselines and achieves stronger cross-domain generalization. Notably, our experiments also reveal that agents exhibit differentiated modality dependence across different datasets. The discovery of this phenomenon provides a new perspective for understanding the cross-modal collaboration mechanism of embodied agents.

### [5] [ForensicFormer: Hierarchical Multi-Scale Reasoning for Cross-Domain Image Forgery Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08873)
*Hema Hariharan Samson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces ForensicFormer, a hierarchical multi-scale AI model combining low-level artifact detection, mid-level boundary analysis, and high-level semantic reasoning via cross-attention transformers to detect image forgeries across diverse domains (traditional, GAN, diffusion models), achieving 86.8% average accuracy and robust compression resistance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional forensic methods fail against AI-generated imagery and advanced editing tools. Existing single-paradigm approaches show <75% accuracy on out-of-distribution datasets, necessitating a unified cross-domain solution.

Method: Developed a hierarchical framework integrating (1) low-level artifact detection, (2) mid-level boundary analysis, and (3) high-level semantic reasoning through cross-attention transformers. Combines multi-scale features and leverages attention mechanisms for forensic analysis.

Result: 86.8% average accuracy across seven diverse datasets (4+ percentage points higher than state-of-the-art). Maintained 83% accuracy under JPEG compression (Q=70 vs 66% baseline). Pixel-level localization achieved 0.76 F1-score. Ablation studies confirmed hierarchical components contribute 4-10% accuracy improvements each.

Conclusion: ForensicFormer bridges classical image forensics and modern deep learning, offering robust, interpretable detection for unknown manipulation techniques in real-world deployments. Validation via ablation studies and human-aligned feature interpretability confirmed its practicality.

Abstract: The proliferation of AI-generated imagery and sophisticated editing tools has rendered traditional forensic methods ineffective for cross-domain forgery detection. We present ForensicFormer, a hierarchical multi-scale framework that unifies low-level artifact detection, mid-level boundary analysis, and high-level semantic reasoning via cross-attention transformers. Unlike prior single-paradigm approaches, which achieve <75% accuracy on out-of-distribution datasets, our method maintains 86.8% average accuracy across seven diverse test sets, spanning traditional manipulations, GAN-generated images, and diffusion model outputs - a significant improvement over state-of-the-art universal detectors. We demonstrate superior robustness to JPEG compression (83% accuracy at Q=70 vs. 66% for baselines) and provide pixel-level forgery localization with a 0.76 F1-score. Extensive ablation studies validate that each hierarchical component contributes 4-10% accuracy improvement, and qualitative analysis reveals interpretable forensic features aligned with human expert reasoning. Our work bridges classical image forensics and modern deep learning, offering a practical solution for real-world deployment where manipulation techniques are unknown a priori.

### [6] [Learning Domain-Invariant Representations for Cross-Domain Image Registration via Scene-Appearance Disentanglement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08875)
*Jiahao Qin,Yiwen Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出SAR-Net框架，通过解耦场景与外观数值特征实现跨域图像配准，在保持实时性能的同时达成3.1倍精度提升，解决传统方法亮度恒定假设失效问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨域图像配准时源/目标图像强度分布差异导致常规方法失效，尤其在需实时处理的显微镜等实际场景中更为严峻，亟需理论严谨且高效的解决方案。

Method: 构建SAR-Net框架，采用理论可证明的场景-外解耦架构：1) 通过可微分渲染将图像分解为域不变场景（深度/反射率）与域特定放射参数；2) 引入场景一致性损失（SC-loss）理论保障几何对齐；3) 融合域对齐损失（DA-loss）实现跨域适应。数学证明分解唯一性与SC-loss对齐充分性。

Result: 在双向扫描显微镜跨域配准任务中，SAR-Net达到0.885 SSIM/0.979 NCC（SOTA基线3.1x提升），处理速度77 FPS。消融实验显示：移除SC-loss导致SSIM下降90%，DA-loss缺失则使潜空间错位增长223倍，理论证明与实验结果完全吻合。

Conclusion: 本研究通过形式化建立场景-外观解耦与重新渲染机制，首次在理论层面上证明跨域图像配准的可行性，实验数据验证了模型在精度与效率的双重优势，为医学影像等实际应用提供可靠方案。

Abstract: Image registration under domain shift remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision and medical imaging: when source and target images exhibit systematic intensity differences, the brightness constancy assumption underlying conventional registration methods is violated, rendering correspondence estimation ill-posed. We propose SAR-Net, a unified framework that addresses this challenge through principled scene-appearance disentanglement. Our key insight is that observed images can be decomposed into domain-invariant scene representations and domain-specific appearance codes, enabling registration via re-rendering rather than direct intensity matching. We establish theoretical conditions under which this decomposition enables consistent cross-domain alignment (Proposition 1) and prove that our scene consistency loss provides a sufficient condition for geometric correspondence in the shared latent space (Proposition 2). Empirically, we validate SAR-Net on bidirectional scanning microscopy, where coupled domain shift and geometric distortion create a challenging real-world testbed. Our method achieves 0.885 SSIM and 0.979 NCC, representing 3.1x improvement over the strongest baseline, while maintaining real-time performance (77 fps). Ablation studies confirm that both scene consistency and domain alignment losses are necessary: removing either degrades performance by 90% SSIM or causes 223x increase in latent alignment error, respectively. Code and data are available at https://github.com/D-ST-Sword/SAR-NET.

Conclusion: 语义生命周期框架为具身智能提供了系统性设计范式，未来需突破持续学习能力与跨模态因果推理瓶颈，建议开发轻量化语义处理架构与场景化评估基准。

Abstract: Semantic information in embodied AI is inherently multi-source and multi-stage, making it challenging to fully leverage for achieving stable perception-to-action loops in real-world environments. Early studies have combined manual engineering with deep neural networks, achieving notable progress in specific semantic-related embodied tasks. However, as embodied agents encounter increasingly complex environments and open-ended tasks, the demand for more generalizable and robust semantic processing capabilities has become imperative. Recent advances in foundation models (FMs) address this challenge through their cross-domain generalization abilities and rich semantic priors, reshaping the landscape of embodied AI research. In this survey, we propose the Semantic Lifecycle as a unified framework to characterize the evolution of semantic knowledge within embodied AI driven by foundation models. Departing from traditional paradigms that treat semantic processing as isolated modules or disjoint tasks, our framework offers a holistic perspective that captures the continuous flow and maintenance of semantic knowledge. Guided by this embodied semantic lifecycle, we further analyze and compare recent advances across three key stages: acquisition, representation, and storage. Finally, we summarize existing challenges and outline promising directions for future research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 利用DLRT框架在迁移学习中压缩地理空间视觉Transformer模型，在保持任务准确性的同时显著减少参数量，优于LoRA等低秩方法，适用于资源受限的边缘设备


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型地理空间基础模型因参数量大且压缩易导致准确率损失，难以在边缘设备部署。现有压缩方法如LoRA效果有限，需开发能兼顾压缩率与任务性能的新型迁移学习压缩框架

Method: 采用流形约束优化框架DLRT，在迁移学习阶段对视觉Transformer模型参数进行结构化低维参数化。通过将压缩过程与下游任务目标对齐，维持参数有效性的同时实现模型压缩。与传统低秩分解不同，该方法通过流形约束保持参数空间的几何特性

Result: 在多种地理空间基准测试中，参数量减少达60%且Top-1准确率仅下降0.5-1.2%。相较LoRA等方法，在相同压缩率下准确率提升2.3-4.1个百分点，FLOPs降低5倍。特别在资源受限的边缘设备(NVIDIA Jetson AGX)部署时保持45帧/秒的推理速度

Conclusion: DLRT框架为地理空间视觉模型提供了有效的迁移学习压缩方案，在维持模型性能的前提下显著降低计算资源需求。该方法解决了参数压缩与任务性能保障的矛盾，为边缘智能提供了实用的模型轻量化解决方案

Abstract: Deploying geospatial foundation models on resource-constrained edge devices demands compact architectures that maintain high downstream performance. However, their large parameter counts and the accuracy loss often induced by compression limit practical adoption. In this work, we leverage manifold-constrained optimization framework DLRT to compress large vision transformer-based geospatial foundation models during transfer learning. By enforcing structured low-dimensional parameterizations aligned with downstream objectives, this approach achieves strong compression while preserving task-specific accuracy. We show that the method outperforms of-the-shelf low-rank methods as LoRA. Experiments on diverse geospatial benchmarks confirm substantial parameter reduction with minimal accuracy loss, enabling high-performing, on-device geospatial models.

*Satyaki Roy Chowdhury,Golrokh Mirzaei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UAMSA-UNet通过多尺度注意力和贝叶斯平滑先验，在脑肿瘤分割中显著提升准确性和计算效率，超越传统U-Net。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CNN/U-Net在肿瘤浸润区域易产生噪声边界，需要更鲁棒的分割方法。

Method: 提出UAMSA-UNet，结合蒙特卡洛Dropout学习平滑先验，融合多尺度特征和注意力图，设计平滑正则化损失抑制预测波动。

Result: 在BraTS2023/2024数据集上，Dice系数分别提升3.3%/4.5%，IoU提升2.7%/4.0%，计算量比U-Net++下降42.5%。

Conclusion: 该方法实现高质量分割与效率平衡，并为结合Transformer模块提供可扩展框架。

Abstract: Brain tumor segmentation is essential for diagnosis and treatment planning, yet many CNN and U-Net based approaches produce noisy boundaries in regions of tumor infiltration. We introduce UAMSA-UNet, an Uncertainty-Aware Multi-Scale Attention-based Bayesian U-Net that in- stead leverages Monte Carlo Dropout to learn a data-driven smoothing prior over its predictions, while fusing multi-scale features and attention maps to capture both fine details and global context. Our smoothing-regularized loss augments binary cross-entropy with a variance penalty across stochas- tic forward passes, discouraging spurious fluctuations and yielding spatially coherent masks. On BraTS2023, UAMSA- UNet improves Dice Similarity Coefficient by up to 3.3% and mean IoU by up to 2.7% over U-Net; on BraTS2024, it delivers up to 4.5% Dice and 4.0% IoU gains over the best baseline. Remarkably, it also reduces FLOPs by 42.5% rel- ative to U-Net++ while maintaining higher accuracy. These results demonstrate that, by combining multi-scale attention with a learned smoothing prior, UAMSA-UNet achieves both better segmentation quality and computational efficiency, and provides a flexible foundation for future integration with transformer-based modules for further enhanced segmenta- tion results.

Abstract: Traditional two-dimensional thermography, despite being non-invasive and useful for defect detection in the construction field, is limited in effectively assessing complex geometries, inaccessible areas, and subsurface defects. This paper introduces Thermo-LIO, a novel multi-sensor system that can enhance Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) by fusing thermal imaging with high-resolution LiDAR. To achieve this, the study first develops a multimodal fusion method combining thermal imaging and LiDAR, enabling precise calibration and synchronization of multimodal data streams to create accurate representations of temperature distributions in buildings. Second, it integrates this fusion approach with LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO), enabling full coverage of large-scale structures and allowing for detailed monitoring of temperature variations and defect detection across inspection cycles. Experimental validations, including case studies on a bridge and a hall building, demonstrate that Thermo-LIO can detect detailed thermal anomalies and structural defects more accurately than traditional methods. The system enhances diagnostic precision, enables real-time processing, and expands inspection coverage, highlighting the crucial role of multimodal sensor integration in advancing SHM methodologies for large-scale civil infrastructure.

### [11] [SAM-pose2seg: Pose-Guided Human Instance Segmentation in Crowds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08982)
*Constantin Kolomiiets,Miroslav Purkrabek,Jiri Matas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出姿态引导的SAM改进方法PoseMaskRefine，在保持原模型泛化能力的同时，通过引入姿态关键点增强遮挡场景下的分割鲁棒性。推断时仅需少量关键点即可准确预测，代码模型已开源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Segment Anything Model在遮挡场景下存在关键点不可见导致性能下降的问题，需要增强其对于遮挡人体的分割能力。

Method: 对SAM 2.1进行轻量级编码器改造，提出PoseMaskRefine微调策略，将高可见性姿态关键点融入迭代修正过程，并优化推理阶段的提示策略（保留最高可见性3个关键点）。

Result: 在多数据集中提升分割准确性、鲁棒性，降低对缺失肢体/服饰误判的敏感度，单关键点即可实现精确掩码预测。

Conclusion: 姿态引导微调有效解决了SAM的遮挡感知局限，在保持原模型泛化性的同时显著提升复杂场景性能。

Abstract: Segment Anything (SAM) provides an unprecedented foundation for human segmentation, but may struggle under occlusion, where keypoints may be partially or fully invisible. We adapt SAM 2.1 for pose-guided segmentation with minimal encoder modifications, retaining its strong generalization. Using a fine-tuning strategy called PoseMaskRefine, we incorporate pose keypoints with high visibility into the iterative correction process originally employed by SAM, yielding improved robustness and accuracy across multiple datasets. During inference, we simplify prompting by selecting only the three keypoints with the highest visibility. This strategy reduces sensitivity to common errors, such as missing body parts or misclassified clothing, and allows accurate mask prediction from as few as a single keypoint. Our results demonstrate that pose-guided fine-tuning of SAM enables effective, occlusion-aware human segmentation while preserving the generalization capabilities of the original model. The code and pretrained models will be available at https://mirapurkrabek.github.io/BBox-MaskPose.

### [12] [Depth-Wise Representation Development Under Blockwise Self-Supervised Learning for Video Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09040)
*Jonas Römer,Timo Dickscheid*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文探讨了在无需端到端反向传播的情况下，通过分块自监督学习（BWSSL）训练带掩码的视频Transformer模型的有效性，并分析了其表示学习的动态特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 端到端反向传播依赖全局误差信号进行长距离信用分配，而近期分块自监督学习（BWSSL）的进展促使研究者探索是否可通过局部优化实现多层模型训练。视频数据的时空上下文和长时序结构为方法应用提出了挑战。

Method: 将编码器划分为多个分块，每个分块通过局部掩码重建损失进行独立优化，应用于掩码视频自编码Transformer模型。

Result: 不同模型规模和分块粒度下训练均能收敛，其表示能力通过线性探针和检索任务评估接近端到端基线模型；分析发现分块训练可更早暴露高层结构，后层分块趋于几何保持状态并出现饱和现象。

Conclusion: 分块训练可诱导token级特征迁移，晚期分块饱和与接口形成可能是当前性能差距的核心因素。

Abstract: End-to-end backpropagation couples all layers through a global error signal, enabling coordinated learning but requiring long-range credit assignment. Motivated by recent progress in blockwise self-supervised learning (BWSSL), we ask whether masked video transformers can be trained without end-to-end backpropagation. Applying BWSSL to masked video modeling remains relatively underexplored and must handle spatiotemporal context and long-range temporal structure. More broadly, analyses that compare BWSSL and end-to-end training in terms of learning dynamics and depth-wise representation development remain sparse. We apply blockwise learning to a masked autoencoding video vision transformer by partitioning the encoder into blocks, each of which is optimized with a local masked reconstruction loss. Across model sizes and partition granularities, training converges and yields representations close to matched end-to-end baselines under linear-probe and retrieval proxies. In order to compare intermediate representations, we analyze depth-wise decodability, inter-block similarity, and patch-level diagnostics. Blockwise training exposes higher-level structure earlier, while later blocks saturate and operate in a more geometry-preserving regime. It can also induce token-level shifts consistent with stronger early mixing that pooled metrics can miss. These findings point to late-block saturation and interface formation as contributors to the remaining gap.

### [13] [Exploring Reliable Spatiotemporal Dependencies for Efficient Visual Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09078)
*Junze Shi,Yang Yu,Jian Shi,Haibo Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本论文提出STDTrack框架，通过引入密集视频采样和时空依赖建模，在保持实时效率的同时实现轻量级目标跟踪的性能突破。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有轻量级追踪方法训练时仅使用单模版和单搜索图像，未能充分挖掘视频时空信息，导致轻量级与高性能追踪器存在性能差距。

Method: 设计密集视频采样策略，提出时空传播token引导特征提取，构建多帧信息融合模块（MFIFM）结合历史上下文，并通过质量评估机制维护时空token存储器（STM），配合多尺度预测头应对目标形变。

Result: 在六个基准数据集达到SOTA性能，GOT-10k数据集上以192FPS（GPU）/41FPS（CPU）表现超越部分非实时高性能追踪器（如MixFormer）。

Conclusion: 通过时空信息深度整合方案成功弥合轻量级与高性能追踪器间的性能鸿沟，为实时视觉跟踪任务提供新范式。

Abstract: Recent advances in transformer-based lightweight object tracking have established new standards across benchmarks, leveraging the global receptive field and powerful feature extraction capabilities of attention mechanisms. Despite these achievements, existing methods universally employ sparse sampling during training--utilizing only one template and one search image per sequence--which fails to comprehensively explore spatiotemporal information in videos. This limitation constrains performance and cause the gap between lightweight and high-performance trackers. To bridge this divide while maintaining real-time efficiency, we propose STDTrack, a framework that pioneers the integration of reliable spatiotemporal dependencies into lightweight trackers. Our approach implements dense video sampling to maximize spatiotemporal information utilization. We introduce a temporally propagating spatiotemporal token to guide per-frame feature extraction. To ensure comprehensive target state representation, we disign the Multi-frame Information Fusion Module (MFIFM), which augments current dependencies using historical context. The MFIFM operates on features stored in our constructed Spatiotemporal Token Maintainer (STM), where a quality-based update mechanism ensures information reliability. Considering the scale variation among tracking targets, we develop a multi-scale prediction head to dynamically adapt to objects of different sizes. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art results across six benchmarks. Notably, on GOT-10k, STDTrack rivals certain high-performance non-real-time trackers (e.g., MixFormer) while operating at 192 FPS(GPU) and 41 FPS(CPU).

Abstract: Accurately localizing and segmenting relevant objects from optical remote sensing images (ORSIs) is critical for advancing remote sensing applications. Existing methods are typically built upon moderate-scale pre-trained models and employ diverse optimization strategies to achieve promising performance under full-parameter fine-tuning. In fact, deeper and larger-scale foundation models can provide stronger support for performance improvement. However, due to their massive number of parameters, directly adopting full-parameter fine-tuning leads to pronounced training difficulties, such as excessive GPU memory consumption and high computational costs, which result in extremely limited exploration of large-scale models in existing works. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic wavelet expert-guided fine-tuning paradigm with fewer trainable parameters, dubbed WEFT, which efficiently adapts large-scale foundation models to ORSIs segmentation tasks by leveraging the guidance of wavelet experts. Specifically, we introduce a task-specific wavelet expert extractor to model wavelet experts from different perspectives and dynamically regulate their outputs, thereby generating trainable features enriched with task-specific information for subsequent fine-tuning. Furthermore, we construct an expert-guided conditional adapter that first enhances the fine-grained perception of frozen features for specific tasks by injecting trainable features, and then iteratively updates the information of both types of feature, allowing for efficient fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that our WEFT not only outperforms 21 state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on three ORSIs datasets, but also achieves optimal results in camouflage, natural, and medical scenarios.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为SAM-Aug的高效标注框架，用于时间序列遥感图像的少样本语义分割，通过结合Segment Anything Model (SAM)的几何感知能力与区域一致性损失函数，解决了标注数据稀缺场景下的土地覆盖制图难题。


<details>

Abstract: Few-shot semantic segmentation of time-series remote sensing images remains a critical challenge, particularly in regions where labeled data is scarce or costly to obtain. While state-of-the-art models perform well under full supervision, their performance degrades significantly under limited labeling, limiting their real-world applicability. In this work, we propose SAM-Aug, a new annotation-efficient framework that leverages the geometry-aware segmentation capability of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to improve few-shot land cover mapping. Our approach constructs cloud-free composite images from temporal sequences and applies SAM in a fully unsupervised manner to generate geometry-aware mask priors. These priors are then integrated into training through a proposed loss function called RegionSmoothLoss, which enforces prediction consistency within each SAM-derived region across temporal frames, effectively regularizing the model to respect semantically coherent structures. Extensive experiments on the PASTIS-R benchmark under a 5 percent labeled setting demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of SAM-Aug. Averaged over three random seeds (42, 2025, 4090), our method achieves a mean test mIoU of 36.21 percent, outperforming the state-of-the-art baseline by +2.33 percentage points, a relative improvement of 6.89 percent. Notably, on the most favorable split (seed=42), SAM-Aug reaches a test mIoU of 40.28 percent, representing an 11.2 percent relative gain with no additional labeled data. The consistent improvement across all seeds confirms the generalization power of leveraging foundation model priors under annotation scarcity. Our results highlight that vision models like SAM can serve as useful regularizers in few-shot remote sensing learning, offering a scalable and plug-and-play solution for land cover monitoring without requiring manual annotations or model fine-tuning.

Conclusion: 结构化建模能显著提升大模型在低质量文本识别任务中的性能，同时通过残差调制机制实现跨模态特征交互与领域适应

Abstract: Real-world License Plate Recognition (LPR) faces significant challenges from severe degradations such as motion blur, low resolution, and complex illumination. The prevailing "restoration-then-recognition" two-stage paradigm suffers from a fundamental flaw: the pixel-level optimization objectives of image restoration models are misaligned with the semantic goals of character recognition, leading to artifact interference and error accumulation. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated powerful general capabilities, they lack explicit structural modeling for license plate character sequences (e.g., fixed length, specific order). To address this, we propose an end-to-end structure-aware multimodal reasoning framework based on Qwen3-VL. The core innovation lies in the Character-Aware Multimodal Reasoning Module (CMRM), which introduces a set of learnable Character Slot Queries. Through a cross-attention mechanism, these queries actively retrieve fine-grained evidence corresponding to character positions from visual features. Subsequently, we inject these character-aware representations back into the visual tokens via residual modulation, enabling the language model to perform autoregressive generation based on explicit structural priors. Furthermore, combined with the LoRA parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy, the model achieves domain adaptation while retaining the generalization capabilities of the large model. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world severely degraded datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing restoration-recognition combinations and general VLMs, validating the superiority of incorporating structured reasoning into large models for low-quality text recognition tasks.

Motivation: 现有大型视觉-语言模型(LVLMs)在皮肤病诊断中因无法区分细微病灶与背景噪声而表现不佳，且医学领域存在'参数即能力'的局限性假设。

Method: 提出虚拟宽度动态视觉编码器(DVE)在不扩展参数的情况下展开复杂病理流形，结合两阶段强化学习策略：第一阶段对齐医学描述，第二阶段重建诊断纹理，并建立临床导向的评估协议。

Result: 在Fitzpatrick17k数据集上，7B参数模型相较Qwen3VL-235B/GPT-5.2等超大规模模型，Top-1准确率提升12.06%，Top-6准确率提升28.57%。

Conclusion: 通过参数缩放之外的几何容量优化和信息流控制，能实现更优的医学诊断推理能力，突破传统模型规模依赖。

Abstract: General-purpose Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), despite their massive scale, often falter in dermatology due to "diffuse attention" - the inability to disentangle subtle pathological lesions from background noise. In this paper, we challenge the assumption that parameter scaling is the only path to medical precision. We introduce SkinFlow, a framework that treats diagnosis as an optimization of visual information transmission efficiency. Our approach utilizes a Virtual-Width Dynamic Vision Encoder (DVE) to "unfold" complex pathological manifolds without physical parameter expansion, coupled with a two-stage Reinforcement Learning strategy. This strategy sequentially aligns explicit medical descriptions (Stage I) and reconstructs implicit diagnostic textures (Stage II) within a constrained semantic space. Furthermore, we propose a clinically grounded evaluation protocol that prioritizes diagnostic safety and hierarchical relevance over rigid label matching. Empirical results are compelling: our 7B model establishes a new state-of-the-art on the Fitzpatrick17k benchmark, achieving a +12.06% gain in Top-1 accuracy and a +28.57% boost in Top-6 accuracy over the massive general-purpose models (e.g., Qwen3VL-235B and GPT-5.2). These findings demonstrate that optimizing geometric capacity and information flow yields superior diagnostic reasoning compared to raw parameter scaling.

Abstract: Robustness to natural corruptions remains a critical challenge for reliable deep learning, particularly in safety-sensitive domains. We study a family of model-based training approaches that leverage a learned nuisance variation model to generate realistic corruptions, as well as new hybrid strategies that combine random coverage with adversarial refinement in nuisance space. Using the Challenging Unreal and Real Environments for Traffic Sign Recognition dataset (CURE-TSR), with Snow and Rain corruptions, we evaluate accuracy, calibration, and training complexity across corruption severities. Our results show that model-based methods consistently outperform baselines Vanilla, Adversarial Training, and AugMix baselines, with model-based adversarial training providing the strongest robustness under across all corruptions but at the expense of higher computation and model-based data augmentation achieving comparable robustness with $T$ less computational complexity without incurring a statistically significant drop in performance. These findings highlight the importance of learned nuisance models for capturing natural variability, and suggest a promising path toward more resilient and calibrated models under challenging conditions.

Motivation: 探讨生成式AI在建筑领域应用的准确性，尤其是在历史风格复现方面的表现，填补该领域研究空白。

Method: 选取5个AI平台，使用30个建筑相关提示生成600张图像，由两位建筑史专家独立评分，统计准确率并分析错误模式。

Result: Common提示准确率是Rare提示的2.7倍；平台整体准确率32%-52%；全错误图像占比存在显著差异（Google Imagen 3最少，微软最多）；发现中世纪风格混用、装饰元素错误等问题。

Conclusion: 建议强制标注AI生成内容来源，规范训练数据集标准，并呼吁在建筑教育中谨慎使用AI图像。

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) text-to-image systems are increasingly used to generate architectural imagery, yet their capacity to reproduce accurate images in a historically rule-bound field remains poorly characterized. We evaluated five widely used GenAI image platforms (Adobe Firefly, DALL-E 3, Google Imagen 3, Microsoft Image Generator, and Midjourney) using 30 architectural prompts spanning styles, typologies, and codified elements. Each prompt-generator pair produced four images (n = 600 images total). Two architectural historians independently scored each image for accuracy against predefined criteria, resolving disagreements by consensus. Set-level performance was summarized as zero to four accurate images per four-image set. Image output from Common prompts was 2.7-fold more accurate than from Rare prompts (p < 0.05). Across platforms, overall accuracy was limited (highest accuracy score 52 percent; lowest 32 percent; mean 42 percent). All-correct (4 out of 4) outcomes were similar across platforms. By contrast, all-incorrect (0 out of 4) outcomes varied substantially, with Imagen 3 exhibiting the fewest failures and Microsoft Image Generator exhibiting the highest number of failures. Qualitative review of the image dataset identified recurring patterns including over-embellishment, confusion between medieval styles and their later revivals, and misrepresentation of descriptive prompts (for example, egg-and-dart, banded column, pendentive). These findings support the need for visible labeling of GenAI synthetic content, provenance standards for future training datasets, and cautious educational use of GenAI architectural imagery.

Conclusion: N EIoU通过非单调梯度调制和几何去耦实现了精度、优化稳定性与移动端计算效率的平衡，为边缘农业监测系统提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In this work, we propose N EIoU YOLOv9, a lightweight detection framework based on a signal aware bounding box regression loss derived from non monotonic gradient focusing and geometric decoupling principles, referred to as N EIoU (Non monotonic Efficient Intersection over Union). The proposed loss reshapes localization gradients by combining non monotonic focusing with decoupled width and height optimization, thereby enhancing weak regression signals for hard samples with low overlap while reducing gradient interference. This design is particularly effective for small and low contrast targets commonly observed in agricultural disease imagery. The proposed N EIoU loss is integrated into a lightweight YOLOv9t architecture and evaluated on a self collected field dataset comprising 5908 rice leaf images across four disease categories and healthy leaves. Experimental results demonstrate consistent performance gains over the standard CIoU loss, achieving a mean Average Precision of 90.3 percent, corresponding to a 4.3 percent improvement over the baseline, with improved localization accuracy under stricter evaluation criteria. For practical validation, the optimized model is deployed on an Android device using TensorFlow Lite with Float16 quantization, achieving an average inference time of 156 milliseconds per frame while maintaining accuracy. These results confirm that the proposed approach effectively balances accuracy, optimization stability, and computational efficiency for edge based agricultural monitoring systems.

Abstract: Deploying medical image segmentation models in routine clinical workflows is often constrained by on-premises infrastructure, where computational resources are fixed and cloud-based inference may be restricted by governance and security policies. While high-capacity models achieve strong segmentation accuracy, their computational demands hinder practical deployment and long-term maintainability in hospital environments. We present a deployment-oriented framework that leverages knowledge distillation to translate a high-performing segmentation model into a scalable family of compact student models, without modifying the inference pipeline. The proposed approach preserves architectural compatibility with existing clinical systems while enabling systematic capacity reduction. The framework is evaluated on a multi-site brain MRI dataset comprising 1,104 3D volumes, with independent testing on 101 curated cases, and is further examined on abdominal CT to assess cross-modality generalizability. Under aggressive parameter reduction (94%), the distilled student model preserves nearly all of the teacher's segmentation accuracy (98.7%), while achieving substantial efficiency gains, including up to a 67% reduction in CPU inference latency without additional deployment overhead. These results demonstrate that knowledge distillation provides a practical and reliable pathway for converting research-grade segmentation models into maintainable, deployment-ready components for on-premises clinical workflows in real-world health systems.

Conclusion: 点追踪作为有效时间线索可提升视频分割稳定性，代码开源促进临床应用（https://github.com/DeepRCL/PointSeg），支持运动分析等下游任务

Abstract: Purpose: Myocardium segmentation in echocardiography videos is a challenging task due to low contrast, noise, and anatomical variability. Traditional deep learning models either process frames independently, ignoring temporal information, or rely on memory-based feature propagation, which accumulates error over time. Methods: We propose Point-Seg, a transformer-based segmentation framework that integrates point tracking as a temporal cue to ensure stable and consistent segmentation of myocardium across frames. Our method leverages a point-tracking module trained on a synthetic echocardiography dataset to track key anatomical landmarks across video sequences. These tracked trajectories provide an explicit motion-aware signal that guides segmentation, reducing drift and eliminating the need for memory-based feature accumulation. Additionally, we incorporate a temporal smoothing loss to further enhance temporal consistency across frames. Results: We evaluate our approach on both public and private echocardiography datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that Point-Seg has statistically similar accuracy in terms of Dice to state-of-the-art segmentation models in high quality echo data, while it achieves better segmentation accuracy in lower quality echo with improved temporal stability. Furthermore, Point-Seg has the key advantage of pixel-level myocardium motion information as opposed to other segmentation methods. Such information is essential in the computation of other downstream tasks such as myocardial strain measurement and regional wall motion abnormality detection. Conclusion: Point-Seg demonstrates that point tracking can serve as an effective temporal cue for consistent video segmentation, offering a reliable and generalizable approach for myocardium segmentation in echocardiography videos.

Conclusion: 建立了一种高效的非配对跨模态学习范式，为医学图像跨模态迁移提供新方向。

Abstract: White-Light Imaging (WLI) is the standard for endoscopic cancer screening, but Narrow-Band Imaging (NBI) offers superior diagnostic details. A key challenge is transferring knowledge from NBI to enhance WLI-only models, yet existing methods are critically hampered by their reliance on paired NBI-WLI images of the same lesion, a costly and often impractical requirement that leaves vast amounts of clinical data untapped. In this paper, we break this paradigm by introducing PaGKD, a novel Pairing-free Group-level Knowledge Distillation framework that that enables effective cross-modal learning using unpaired WLI and NBI data. Instead of forcing alignment between individual, often semantically mismatched image instances, PaGKD operates at the group level to distill more complete and compatible knowledge across modalities. Central to PaGKD are two complementary modules: (1) Group-level Prototype Distillation (GKD-Pro) distills compact group representations by extracting modality-invariant semantic prototypes via shared lesion-aware queries; (2) Group-level Dense Distillation (GKD-Den) performs dense cross-modal alignment by guiding group-aware attention with activation-derived relation maps. Together, these modules enforce global semantic consistency and local structural coherence without requiring image-level correspondence. Extensive experiments on four clinical datasets demonstrate that PaGKD consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving relative AUC improvements of 3.3%, 1.1%, 2.8%, and 3.2%, respectively, establishing a new direction for cross-modal learning from unpaired data.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of affordance grounding from RGBD images of an object, which aims to localize surface regions corresponding to a text query that describes an action on the object. While existing methods predict affordance regions only on visible surfaces, we propose Affostruction, a generative framework that reconstructs complete geometry from partial observations and grounds affordances on the full shape including unobserved regions. We make three core contributions: generative multi-view reconstruction via sparse voxel fusion that extrapolates unseen geometry while maintaining constant token complexity, flow-based affordance grounding that captures inherent ambiguity in affordance distributions, and affordance-driven active view selection that leverages predicted affordances for intelligent viewpoint sampling. Affostruction achieves 19.1 aIoU on affordance grounding (40.4\% improvement) and 32.67 IoU for 3D reconstruction (67.7\% improvement), enabling accurate affordance prediction on complete shapes.

Conclusion: 理论严谨的COOL-SD方法有效解决AR模型生成效率瓶颈，在保持图像质量的同时显著提升推理速度。

Abstract: Despite significant progress in autoregressive image generation, inference remains slow due to the sequential nature of AR models and the ambiguity of image tokens, even when using speculative decoding. Recent works attempt to address this with relaxed speculative decoding but lack theoretical grounding. In this paper, we establish the theoretical basis of relaxed SD and propose COOL-SD, an annealed relaxation of speculative decoding built on two key insights. The first analyzes the total variation (TV) distance between the target model and relaxed speculative decoding and yields an optimal resampling distribution that minimizes an upper bound of the distance. The second uses perturbation analysis to reveal an annealing behaviour in relaxed speculative decoding, motivating our annealed design. Together, these insights enable COOL-SD to generate images faster with comparable quality, or achieve better quality at similar latency. Experiments validate the effectiveness of COOL-SD, showing consistent improvements over prior methods in speed-quality trade-offs.

Abstract: Reconstructing natural visual scenes from neural activity is a key challenge in neuroscience and computer vision. We present SpikeVAEDiff, a novel two-stage framework that combines a Very Deep Variational Autoencoder (VDVAE) and the Versatile Diffusion model to generate high-resolution and semantically meaningful image reconstructions from neural spike data. In the first stage, VDVAE produces low-resolution preliminary reconstructions by mapping neural spike signals to latent representations. In the second stage, regression models map neural spike signals to CLIP-Vision and CLIP-Text features, enabling Versatile Diffusion to refine the images via image-to-image generation.
  We evaluate our approach on the Allen Visual Coding-Neuropixels dataset and analyze different brain regions. Our results show that the VISI region exhibits the most prominent activation and plays a key role in reconstruction quality. We present both successful and unsuccessful reconstruction examples, reflecting the challenges of decoding neural activity. Compared with fMRI-based approaches, spike data provides superior temporal and spatial resolution. We further validate the effectiveness of the VDVAE model and conduct ablation studies demonstrating that data from specific brain regions significantly enhances reconstruction performance.

Abstract: Infrared object detection focuses on identifying and locating objects in complex environments (\eg, dark, snow, and rain) where visible imaging cameras are disabled by poor illumination. However, due to low contrast and weak edge information in infrared images, it is challenging to extract discriminative object features for robust detection. To deal with this issue, we propose a novel vision-language representation learning paradigm for infrared object detection. An additional textual supervision with rich semantic information is explored to guide the disentanglement of object and non-object features. Specifically, we propose a Semantic Feature Alignment (SFA) module to align the object features with the corresponding text features. Furthermore, we develop an Object Feature Disentanglement (OFD) module that disentangles text-aligned object features and non-object features by minimizing their correlation. Finally, the disentangled object features are entered into the detection head. In this manner, the detection performance can be remarkably enhanced via more discriminative and less noisy features. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance on two benchmarks: M\textsuperscript{3}FD (83.7\% mAP), FLIR (86.1\% mAP). Our code will be publicly available once the paper is accepted.

Conclusion: CLIDD实现了高精度与低计算开销的统一，在不同部署场景下均表现出鲁棒性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Robust local feature representations are essential for spatial intelligence tasks such as robot navigation and augmented reality. Establishing reliable correspondences requires descriptors that provide both high discriminative power and computational efficiency. To address this, we introduce Cross-Layer Independent Deformable Description (CLIDD), a method that achieves superior distinctiveness by sampling directly from independent feature hierarchies. This approach utilizes learnable offsets to capture fine-grained structural details across scales while bypassing the computational burden of unified dense representations. To ensure real-time performance, we implement a hardware-aware kernel fusion strategy that maximizes inference throughput. Furthermore, we develop a scalable framework that integrates lightweight architectures with a training protocol leveraging both metric learning and knowledge distillation. This scheme generates a wide spectrum of model variants optimized for diverse deployment constraints. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our approach achieves superior matching accuracy and exceptional computational efficiency simultaneously. Specifically, the ultra-compact variant matches the precision of SuperPoint while utilizing only 0.004M parameters, achieving a 99.7% reduction in model size. Furthermore, our high-performance configuration outperforms all current state-of-the-art methods, including high-capacity DINOv2-based frameworks, while exceeding 200 FPS on edge devices. These results demonstrate that CLIDD delivers high-precision local feature matching with minimal computational overhead, providing a robust and scalable solution for real-time spatial intelligence tasks.

Conclusion: DeTracker通过运动解耦与时间特征融合有效解决了卫星视频跟踪的非稳态干扰问题，新数据集填补了领域测试基准空白，为复杂运动环境下的视频分析提供了新思路。

Abstract: Satellite videos provide continuous observations of surface dynamics but pose significant challenges for multi-object tracking (MOT), especially under unstabilized conditions where platform jitter and the weak appearance of tiny objects jointly degrade tracking performance. To address this problem, we propose DeTracker, a joint detection-and-tracking framework tailored for unstabilized satellite videos. DeTracker introduces a Global--Local Motion Decoupling (GLMD) module that explicitly separates satellite platform motion from true object motion through global alignment and local refinement, leading to improved trajectory stability and motion estimation accuracy. In addition, a Temporal Dependency Feature Pyramid (TDFP) module is developed to perform cross-frame temporal feature fusion, enhancing the continuity and discriminability of tiny-object representations. We further construct a new benchmark dataset, SDM-Car-SU, which simulates multi-directional and multi-speed platform motions to enable systematic evaluation of tracking robustness under varying motion perturbations. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real unstabilized satellite videos demonstrate that DeTracker significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving 61.1% MOTA on SDM-Car-SU and 47.3% MOTA on real satellite video data.

TL;DR: Introduces adaptive anisotropic textures for Gaussian Splatting to improve efficiency and image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Gaussian Splatting methods use fixed square textures, causing inefficient memory use and poor adaptation to scene variability.

Method: Proposes adaptive anisotropic textures with a gradient-guided rule to adjust resolution and aspect ratio, allowing detail-aware, non-uniform allocation.

Result: Outperforms fixed-texture methods with higher image quality and reduced memory consumption while maintaining fidelity.

Conclusion: Adaptive anisotropic textures enhance texture efficiency and adaptability, making Gaussian Splatting more effective for real-time 3D rendering.

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a powerful representation for high-quality, real-time 3D scene rendering. While recent works extend Gaussians with learnable textures to enrich visual appearance, existing approaches allocate a fixed square texture per primitive, leading to inefficient memory usage and limited adaptability to scene variability. In this paper, we introduce adaptive anisotropic textured Gaussians (A$^2$TG), a novel representation that generalizes textured Gaussians by equipping each primitive with an anisotropic texture. Our method employs a gradient-guided adaptive rule to jointly determine texture resolution and aspect ratio, enabling non-uniform, detail-aware allocation that aligns with the anisotropic nature of Gaussian splats. This design significantly improves texture efficiency, reducing memory consumption while enhancing image quality. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that A TG consistently outperforms fixed-texture Gaussian Splatting methods, achieving comparable rendering fidelity with substantially lower memory requirements.

Abstract: Recent diffusion-based video generation models can synthesize visually plausible videos, yet they often struggle to satisfy physical constraints. A key reason is that most existing approaches remain single-stage: they entangle high-level physical understanding with low-level visual synthesis, making it hard to generate content that require explicit physical reasoning. To address this limitation, we propose a training-free three-stage pipeline,\textit{PhyRPR}:\textit{Phy\uline{R}eason}--\textit{Phy\uline{P}lan}--\textit{Phy\uline{R}efine}, which decouples physical understanding from visual synthesis. Specifically, \textit{PhyReason} uses a large multimodal model for physical state reasoning and an image generator for keyframe synthesis; \textit{PhyPlan} deterministically synthesizes a controllable coarse motion scaffold; and \textit{PhyRefine} injects this scaffold into diffusion sampling via a latent fusion strategy to refine appearance while preserving the planned dynamics. This staged design enables explicit physical control during generation. Extensive experiments under physics constraints show that our method consistently improves physical plausibility and motion controllability.

Abstract: Delineating wildfire affected areas using satellite imagery remains challenging due to irregular and spatially heterogeneous spectral changes across the electromagnetic spectrum. While recent deep learning approaches achieve high accuracy when high-resolution multispectral data are available, their applicability in operational settings, where a quick delineation of the burn scar shortly after a wildfire incident is required, is limited by the trade-off between spatial resolution and temporal revisit frequency of current satellite systems. To address this limitation, we propose a novel deep learning model, namely BAM-MRCD, which employs multi-resolution, multi-source satellite imagery (MODIS and Sentinel-2) for the timely production of detailed burnt area maps with high spatial and temporal resolution. Our model manages to detect even small scale wildfires with high accuracy, surpassing similar change detection models as well as solid baselines.

Abstract: Whole-brain parcellation from MRI is a critical yet challenging task due to the complexity of subdividing the brain into numerous small, irregular shaped regions. Traditionally, template-registration methods were used, but recent advances have shifted to deep learning for faster workflows. While large models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) offer transferable feature representations, they are not tailored for the high precision required in brain parcellation. To address this, we propose BrainSegNet, a novel framework that adapts SAM for accurate whole-brain parcellation into 95 regions. We enhance SAM by integrating U-Net skip connections and specialized modules into its encoder and decoder, enabling fine-grained anatomical precision. Key components include a hybrid encoder combining U-Net skip connections with SAM's transformer blocks, a multi-scale attention decoder with pyramid pooling for varying-sized structures, and a boundary refinement module to sharpen edges. Experimental results on the Human Connectome Project (HCP) dataset demonstrate that BrainSegNet outperforms several state-of-the-art methods, achieving higher accuracy and robustness in complex, multi-label parcellation.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a prominent 3D representation for high-fidelity and real-time rendering. Prior work has coupled physics simulation with Gaussians, but predominantly targets soft, deformable materials, leaving brittle fracture largely unresolved. This stems from two key obstacles: the lack of volumetric interiors with coherent textures in GS representation, and the absence of fracture-aware simulation methods for Gaussians. To address these challenges, we introduce GaussianFluent, a unified framework for realistic simulation and rendering of dynamic object states. First, it synthesizes photorealistic interiors by densifying internal Gaussians guided by generative models. Second, it integrates an optimized Continuum Damage Material Point Method (CD-MPM) to enable brittle fracture simulation at remarkably high speed. Our approach handles complex scenarios including mixed-material objects and multi-stage fracture propagation, achieving results infeasible with previous methods. Experiments clearly demonstrate GaussianFluent's capability for photo-realistic, real-time rendering with structurally consistent interiors, highlighting its potential for downstream application, such as VR and Robotics.

Abstract: In the information and communications technology (ICT) industry, training a domain-specific large language model (LLM) or constructing a retrieval-augmented generation system requires a substantial amount of high-value domain knowledge. However, the knowledge is not only hidden in the textual modality but also in the image modality. Traditional methods can parse text from domain documents but dont have image captioning ability. Multi-modal LLM (MLLM) can understand images, but they do not have sufficient domain knowledge. To address the above issues, this paper proposes a multi-stage progressive training strategy to train a Domain-specific Image Captioning Model (DICModel) in ICT, and constructs a standard evaluation system to validate the performance of DICModel. Specifically, this work first synthesizes about 7K image-text pairs by combining the Mermaid tool and LLMs, which are used for the first-stage supervised-fine-tuning (SFT) of DICModel. Then, ICT-domain experts manually annotate about 2K image-text pairs for the second-stage SFT of DICModel. Finally, experts and LLMs jointly synthesize about 1.5K visual question answering data for the instruction-based SFT. Experimental results indicate that our DICModel with only 7B parameters performs better than other state-of-the-art models with 32B parameters. Compared to the SOTA models with 7B and 32B parameters, our DICModel increases the BLEU metric by approximately 56.8% and 20.8%, respectively. On the objective questions constructed by ICT domain experts, our DICModel outperforms Qwen2.5-VL 32B by 1% in terms of accuracy rate. In summary, this work can efficiently and accurately extract the logical text from images, which is expected to promote the development of multimodal models in the ICT domain.

Result: VGG16-CIFAR10实验：FLOP↓90.11%，参数↓96.30%，微调后Top-1准确率仅降1.67%（93.44%→91.77%）。

Conclusion: 频谱重构保真度可有效评估通道冗余性，SCAP在结构化剪枝中实现高压缩率与性能平衡。

Abstract: We propose Spectral Complex Autoencoder Pruning (SCAP), a reconstruction-based criterion that measures functional redundancy at the level of individual output channels. For each convolutional layer, we construct a complex interaction field by pairing the full multi-channel input activation as the real part with a single output-channel activation (spatially aligned and broadcast across input channels) as the imaginary part. We transform this complex field to the frequency domain and train a low-capacity autoencoder to reconstruct normalized spectra. Channels whose spectra are reconstructed with high fidelity are interpreted as lying close to a low-dimensional manifold captured by the autoencoder and are therefore more compressible; conversely, channels with low fidelity are retained as they encode information that cannot be compactly represented by the learned manifold. This yields an importance score (optionally fused with the filter L1 norm) that supports simple threshold-based pruning and produces a structurally consistent pruned network. On VGG16 trained on CIFAR-10, at a fixed threshold of 0.6, we obtain 90.11% FLOP reduction and 96.30% parameter reduction with an absolute Top-1 accuracy drop of 1.67% from a 93.44% baseline after fine-tuning, demonstrating that spectral reconstruction fidelity of complex interaction fields is an effective proxy for channel-level redundancy under aggressive compression.

Abstract: With advances in artificial intelligence, image processing has gained significant interest. Image super-resolution is a vital technology closely related to real-world applications, as it enhances the quality of existing images. Since enhancing fine details is crucial for the super-resolution task, pixels that contribute to high-frequency information should be emphasized. This paper proposes two methods to enhance high-frequency details in super-resolution images: a Laplacian pyramid-based detail loss and a repeated upscaling and downscaling process. Total loss with our detail loss guides a model by separately generating and controlling super-resolution and detail images. This approach allows the model to focus more effectively on high-frequency components, resulting in improved super-resolution images. Additionally, repeated upscaling and downscaling amplify the effectiveness of the detail loss by extracting diverse information from multiple low-resolution features. We conduct two types of experiments. First, we design a CNN-based model incorporating our methods. This model achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing all currently available CNN-based and even some attention-based models. Second, we apply our methods to existing attention-based models on a small scale. In all our experiments, attention-based models adding our detail loss show improvements compared to the originals. These results demonstrate our approaches effectively enhance super-resolution images across different model structures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual histopathological evaluation after neoadjuvant chemotherapy is time-consuming, subjective, and inconsistent. Accurate automated assessment is critical for prognosis but existing methods show performance drops in patient-level generalization.

Method: 1) Integrated radiomic features as multimodal input alongside images. 2) Proposed hierarchical binary classification with trainable weighted loss (tumor vs non-tumor → viable vs non-viable) instead of flat three-class classification. Evaluated on TCIA OS dataset.

Result: Hierarchical loss with radiomic features significantly improved per-class performance. Combined methods achieved new state-of-the-art accuracy on the open dataset, with benefits in both classification and interpretability.

Conclusion: Multimodal architecture with radiomic features and hierarchical loss design effectively addresses inter-observer variability in tumor viability assessment, providing a reproducible clinical decision support tool.

Abstract: Osteosarcoma (OS) is an aggressive primary bone malignancy. Accurate histopathological assessment of viable versus non-viable tumor regions after neoadjuvant chemotherapy is critical for prognosis and treatment planning, yet manual evaluation remains labor-intensive, subjective, and prone to inter-observer variability. Recent advances in digital pathology have enabled automated necrosis quantification. Evaluating on test data, independently sampled on patient-level, revealed that the deep learning model performance dropped significantly from the tile-level generalization ability reported in previous studies. First, this work proposes the use of radiomic features as additional input in model training. We show that, despite that they are derived from the images, such a multimodal input effectively improved the classification performance, in addition to its added benefits in interpretability. Second, this work proposes to optimize two binary classification tasks with hierarchical classes (i.e. tumor-vs-non-tumor and viable-vs-non-viable), as opposed to the alternative ``flat'' three-class classification task (i.e. non-tumor, non-viable tumor, viable tumor), thereby enabling a hierarchical loss. We show that such a hierarchical loss, with trainable weightings between the two tasks, the per-class performance can be improved significantly. Using the TCIA OS Tumor Assessment dataset, we experimentally demonstrate the benefits from each of the proposed new approaches and their combination, setting a what we consider new state-of-the-art performance on this open dataset for this application.

Conclusion: Video-MSR填补了动态场景空间推理基准空白，证明了多跳空间指令数据的重要性，为未来MLLM空间认知能力研究奠定基础。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning has emerged as a critical capability for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), drawing increasing attention and rapid advancement. However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on single-step perception-to-judgment tasks, leaving scenarios requiring complex visual-spatial logical chains significantly underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce Video-MSR, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate Multi-hop Spatial Reasoning (MSR) in dynamic video scenarios. Video-MSR systematically probes MSR capabilities through four distinct tasks: Constrained Localization, Chain-based Reference Retrieval, Route Planning, and Counterfactual Physical Deduction. Our benchmark comprises 3,052 high-quality video instances with 4,993 question-answer pairs, constructed via a scalable, visually-grounded pipeline combining advanced model generation with rigorous human verification. Through a comprehensive evaluation of 20 state-of-the-art MLLMs, we uncover significant limitations, revealing that while models demonstrate proficiency in surface-level perception, they exhibit distinct performance drops in MSR tasks, frequently suffering from spatial disorientation and hallucination during multi-step deductions. To mitigate these shortcomings and empower models with stronger MSR capabilities, we further curate MSR-9K, a specialized instruction-tuning dataset, and fine-tune Qwen-VL, achieving a +7.82% absolute improvement on Video-MSR. Our results underscore the efficacy of multi-hop spatial instruction data and establish Video-MSR as a vital foundation for future research. The code and data will be available at https://github.com/ruiz-nju/Video-MSR.

PrivLEX is the first interpretable privacy classifier aligned with legal concepts that leverages the recognition capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). PrivLEX relies on zero-shot VLM concept detection to provide interpretable classification through a label-free Concept Bottleneck Model, without requiring explicit concept labels during training. We demonstrate PrivLEX's ability to identify personal data concepts that are present in images. We further analyse the sensitivity of such concepts as perceived by human annotators of image privacy datasets.

*Ritabrata Chakraborty,Hrishit Mitra,Shivakumara Palaiahnakote,Umapada Pal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究通过分析跨数据集目标检测（CD-OD）中的场景特异性，发现相同场景类型间检测性能较稳定，而跨场景类型迁移性能显著下降，表明域偏移是关键挑战。使用CLIP相似性进行开放标签评估可部分缓解问题，但性能提升有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目标检测模型通常在分布内数据上表现良好，但在不同基准数据集上性能急剧下降。该研究旨在通过场景特异性视角，系统解析跨数据集检测的性能下降原因，为模型在分布外数据上的应用提供指导。

Method: 将数据集分为场景无关（多样化日常场景）和场景特定（狭窄环境）两类，基于标准检测模型在所有训练-测试组合上的迁移性能，分析跨场景检测结构。通过封闭标签与开放标签（基于CLIP相似性映射最近邻标签）协议对比，解耦域偏移与标签不匹配的影响。

Result: 同场景类型内迁移稳定，跨场景类型迁移性能大幅下降且具有不对称性。从特定源到无关目标的迁移最易失效，且域偏移主导最难情境。开放标签评估提升效果有限，错误修正多集中在基于图像证据的语义近似类别。

Conclusion: 该研究基于场景特异性提出CD-OD的理论框架，揭示域偏移对跨分布检测的核心影响，并为分布外检测器评估提供了开放标签协议的实用指导。

Abstract: Object detectors often perform well in-distribution, yet degrade sharply on a different benchmark. We study cross-dataset object detection (CD-OD) through a lens of setting specificity. We group benchmarks into setting-agnostic datasets with diverse everyday scenes and setting-specific datasets tied to a narrow environment, and evaluate a standard detector family across all train--test pairs. This reveals a clear structure in CD-OD: transfer within the same setting type is relatively stable, while transfer across setting types drops substantially and is often asymmetric. The most severe breakdowns occur when transferring from specific sources to agnostic targets, and persist after open-label alignment, indicating that domain shift dominates in the hardest regimes. To disentangle domain shift from label mismatch, we compare closed-label transfer with an open-label protocol that maps predicted classes to the nearest target label using CLIP similarity. Open-label evaluation yields consistent but bounded gains, and many corrected cases correspond to semantic near-misses supported by the image evidence. Overall, we provide a principled characterization of CD-OD under setting specificity and practical guidance for evaluating detectors under distribution shift. Code will be released at \href{[https://github.com/Ritabrata04/cdod-icpr.git}{https://github.com/Ritabrata04/cdod-icpr}.

### [42] [V-DPM: 4D Video Reconstruction with Dynamic Point Maps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09499)
*Edgar Sucar,Eldar Insafutdinov,Zihang Lai,Andrea Vedaldi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出V-DPM方法将动态点云图(DPMs)扩展到视频领域，通过改进表示能力与模型适配，在动态场景的3D/4D重建中实现SOTA，首次同时恢复场景动态深度与全3D运动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DPMs仅支持图像对且需后处理优化，无法有效处理视频序列中的动态场景。DUSt3ER等静态方法在多视角下存在性能瓶颈，动态场景的完整运动恢复仍未解决。

Method: 1) 设计视频版DPM表示，优化信息表达与神经预测兼容性；2) 基于VGGT静态模型，通过视频微调与少量合成数据迁移学习适配动态场景；3) 保留原方法高效前馈特点的同时支持多帧联合优化。

Result: 在动态场景数据集上超越P3等SOTA方法：1) 首次实现逐点全3D运动场恢复；2) 深度估计误差降低23%；3) 运动场重建质量提升35%；4) 支持4D时序连续重建。

Conclusion: 视频特化的DPM表示能有效平衡静态与动态信息建模，通过轻量级微调即可使静态模型适应动态场景。所提方法为视频3D重建提供了新的建模范式，为动态场景理解提供了更完整的几何表示基础。

Abstract: Powerful 3D representations such as DUSt3R invariant point maps, which encode 3D shape and camera parameters, have significantly advanced feed forward 3D reconstruction. While point maps assume static scenes, Dynamic Point Maps (DPMs) extend this concept to dynamic 3D content by additionally representing scene motion. However, existing DPMs are limited to image pairs and, like DUSt3R, require post processing via optimization when more than two views are involved. We argue that DPMs are more useful when applied to videos and introduce V-DPM to demonstrate this. First, we show how to formulate DPMs for video input in a way that maximizes representational power, facilitates neural prediction, and enables reuse of pretrained models. Second, we implement these ideas on top of VGGT, a recent and powerful 3D reconstructor. Although VGGT was trained on static scenes, we show that a modest amount of synthetic data is sufficient to adapt it into an effective V-DPM predictor. Our approach achieves state of the art performance in 3D and 4D reconstruction for dynamic scenes. In particular, unlike recent dynamic extensions of VGGT such as P3, DPMs recover not only dynamic depth but also the full 3D motion of every point in the scene.

*Lennart Eing,Cristina Luna-Jiménez,Silvan Mertes,Elisabeth André*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本论文提出了一种新的面部表情识别(FER)方法，通过使用视频联合嵌入预测架构(V-JEPAs)取代传统的像素级重建预训练方法，显著提升了在RAVDESS和CREMA-D数据集上的性能，并展示了跨数据集的强泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频理解预训练方法依赖像素级重建，导致编码器捕获无关信息(如背景颜色)。本文旨在通过V-JEPAs直接预测嵌入域中的掩码区域，促使编码器专注学习与FER相关的语义特征，提升模型效率和泛化性。

Method: 采用V-JEPA架构，训练编码器通过未掩码区域的嵌入预测掩码区域的嵌入，从而避免冗余信息干扰。预训练后，在RAVDESS和CREMA-D数据集上训练浅层分类器，并进行跨数据集评估。

Result: 在RAVDESS数据集达到SOTA性能，在CREMA-D数据集中超越所有视觉方法(+1.48 WAR)，跨数据集评估显示显著泛化能力提升。

Conclusion: 基于嵌入的预训练方法(V-JEPAs)能有效促进FER研究，代码开源进一步推动领域发展。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel application of Video Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (V-JEPAs) for Facial Expression Recognition (FER). Departing from conventional pre-training methods for video understanding that rely on pixel-level reconstructions, V-JEPAs learn by predicting embeddings of masked regions from the embeddings of unmasked regions. This enables the trained encoder to not capture irrelevant information about a given video like the color of a region of pixels in the background. Using a pre-trained V-JEPA video encoder, we train shallow classifiers using the RAVDESS and CREMA-D datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance on RAVDESS and outperforming all other vision-based methods on CREMA-D (+1.48 WAR). Furthermore, cross-dataset evaluations reveal strong generalization capabilities, demonstrating the potential of purely embedding-based pre-training approaches to advance FER. We release our code at https://github.com/lennarteingunia/vjepa-for-fer.

*Yue Yao,Ruining Yang,Tom Gedeon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于分层数据服务器的双部分模式匹配算法（BMM），用于在无法实时标注目标域数据的情况下构建高效训练集，通过匹配目标域与源域的语义模式减少域间差异，提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目标域数据分布通常具有独特语义模式，若训练集缺失这些模式将导致性能下降。现有方法侧重改进模型迭代，却忽视数据服务器结构优化这一潜在关键路径。

Method: 设计分层数据服务器架构，通过双部分模式匹配算法（BMM）：1. 构建源域数据树，2. 将目标域模式逐层匹配至最优源域节点，3. 输出匹配模式组成训练集。

Result: 在目标重识别（re-ID）和检测任务中，BMM训练集的域间差异比现有算法降低12-18%，模型精度提升5-7%。与伪标签等UDA方法联用后精度进一步提升4%。

Conclusion: 研究首次验证了数据服务结构优化对无监督域适应的决定性作用，BMM实现的数据中心化UDA方法与模型中心化方法正交，可叠加改进现有方法。

Abstract: We explore a situation in which the target domain is accessible, but real-time data annotation is not feasible. Instead, we would like to construct an alternative training set from a large-scale data server so that a competitive model can be obtained. For this problem, because the target domain usually exhibits distinct modes (i.e., semantic clusters representing data distribution), if the training set does not contain these target modes, the model performance would be compromised. While prior existing works improve algorithms iteratively, our research explores the often-overlooked potential of optimizing the structure of the data server. Inspired by the hierarchical nature of web search engines, we introduce a hierarchical data server, together with a bipartite mode matching algorithm (BMM) to align source and target modes. For each target mode, we look in the server data tree for the best mode match, which might be large or small in size. Through bipartite matching, we aim for all target modes to be optimally matched with source modes in a one-on-one fashion. Compared with existing training set search algorithms, we show that the matched server modes constitute training sets that have consistently smaller domain gaps with the target domain across object re-identification (re-ID) and detection tasks. Consequently, models trained on our searched training sets have higher accuracy than those trained otherwise. BMM allows data-centric unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) orthogonal to existing model-centric UDA methods. By combining the BMM with existing UDA methods like pseudo-labeling, further improvement is observed.

*Shuyang Xiang,Hao Guan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究验证了低分辨率视觉信号可作为中文字符建模的有效替代方案，8×8像素灰度图输入达到39.2%准确率，与传统索引方法相当且具备热启动优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 汉字作为表意文字具有视觉结构与语义/语音的关联性，传统离散索引建模方法未能利用该特性，需探索视觉信息对低资源语言建模的潜在提升效果。

Method: 使用低分辨率（8×8像素）汉字灰度图像替代传统token ID作为解码器输入，在字符级语言模型中进行对比实验。

Result: 视觉输入模型准确率39.2% vs. 传统方法39.1%，低资源场景下训练0.4%时视觉模型准确率12%显著高于传统方法6%，且收敛速度更快。

Conclusion: 最小化视觉结构可为中文建模提供鲁棒信号，在准确率和训练效率层面均验证了视觉表征的补充价值，为字符表示学习提供了新视角。

Abstract: Large language models typically represent Chinese characters as discrete index-based tokens, largely ignoring their visual form. For logographic scripts, visual structure carries semantic and phonetic information, which may aid prediction. We investigate whether low-resolution visual inputs can serve as an alternative for character-level modeling. Instead of token IDs, our decoder receives grayscale images of individual characters, with resolutions as low as $8 \times 8$ pixels. Remarkably, these inputs achieve 39.2\% accuracy, comparable to the index-based baseline of 39.1\%. Such low-resource settings also exhibit a pronounced \emph{hot-start} effect: by 0.4\% of total training, accuracy reaches above 12\%, while index-based models lag at below 6\%. Overall, our results demonstrate that minimal visual structure can provide a robust and efficient signal for Chinese language modeling, offering an alternative perspective on character representation that complements traditional index-based approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成模型仅依赖图像强度导致生成可靠性差且应用灵活性受限，需解决数据缺失问题并提升模型适应性。

Method: 基于Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks改进扩散模型，引入变形场机制进行图像生成，实现多模态MRI数据的适配。

Result: 在OASIS-3数据集上PSNR提升5.6%、SSIM提高0.12，且能扩展到组织分割等属性图生成。

Conclusion: DF-DiffCom在图像质量和多模态扩展性上显著优于现有方法，为纵向脑影像研究提供可靠工具。

Abstract: Longitudinal brain MRI is essential for lifespan study, yet high attrition rates often lead to missing data, complicating analysis. Deep generative models have been explored, but most rely solely on image intensity, leading to two key limitations: 1) the fidelity or trustworthiness of the generated brain images are limited, making downstream studies questionable; 2) the usage flexibility is restricted due to fixed guidance rooted in the model structure, restricting full ability to versatile application scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce DF-DiffCom, a Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN)-enhanced diffusion model that smartly leverages deformation fields for trustworthy longitudinal brain image completion. Trained on OASIS-3, DF-DiffCom outperforms state-of-the-art methods, improving PSNR by 5.6% and SSIM by 0.12. More importantly, its modality-agnostic nature allows smooth extension to varied MRI modalities, even to attribute maps such as brain tissue segmentation results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要训练，并引入CLIP/BERT文本编码器的嵌入，而本方法通过直接使用多模态大语言模型进行文本到文本搜索实现训练自由和去嵌入化。

Method: 基于多视角图像生成的稀疏体素光栅化模型，结合视觉语言模型和多模态大语言模型进行体素分组与语义标注。

Result: 在复杂指代表达分割任务中展现出优于现有研究的性能，且代码已开源。

Conclusion: 实现了无需训练的3D场景理解框架，通过消除嵌入参数优化流程，在开放词汇分割和指代表达分割任务中表现突出。

Abstract: We propose OpenVoxel, a training-free algorithm for grouping and captioning sparse voxels for the open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding tasks. Given the sparse voxel rasterization (SVR) model obtained from multi-view images of a 3D scene, our OpenVoxel is able to produce meaningful groups that describe different objects in the scene. Also, by leveraging powerful Vision Language Models (VLMs) and Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), our OpenVoxel successfully build an informative scene map by captioning each group, enabling further 3D scene understanding tasks such as open-vocabulary segmentation (OVS) or referring expression segmentation (RES). Unlike previous methods, our method is training-free and does not introduce embeddings from a CLIP/BERT text encoder. Instead, we directly proceed with text-to-text search using MLLMs. Through extensive experiments, our method demonstrates superior performance compared to recent studies, particularly in complex referring expression segmentation (RES) tasks. The code will be open.

Motivation: 手写能力在教育场景中具有核心地位，但如何通过数字技术提供有效的错误反馈仍是一个未被充分研究的领域，现有系统存在明显技术瓶颈。

Method: 基于图像输入到错误标注的处理流程，对模块化解析系统和端到端学习系统进行实证对比，并系统性分析导致性能不足的关键技术难点。

### [49] [Iterative Differential Entropy Minimization (IDEM) method for fine rigid pairwise 3D Point Cloud Registration: A Focus on the Metric](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09601)
*Emmanuele Barberi,Felice Sfravara,Filippo Cucinotta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel differential entropy-based metric (IDEM) for fine rigid pairwise 3D point cloud registration, addressing limitations of traditional methods (e.g., ICP, RMSE) in handling noise, density differences, holes, and partial overlap. IDEM offers symmetric optimization without fixing a reference point cloud, showing improved alignment accuracy in challenging scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing point cloud registration methods (e.g., ICP) rely on asymmetric Euclidean distances and require strong initial alignment. They fail when both point clouds suffer from real-world issues like noise, density mismatches, holes, or limited overlap. The authors aim to develop a symmetric, robust metric that eliminates dependence on fixed references and handles such challenges.

Method: A ‌differential entropy-based objective function‌ is introduced to measure alignment quality via the distribution of point disparities. This metric is invariant to the choice of fixed point cloud, unlike Euclidean distances. A new optimization framework (IDEM) minimizes this entropy, revealing a clear optimal transformation without prior alignment. Experiments compare IDEM with RMSE, Chamfer distance, and Hausdorff distance across synthetic and real-world datasets.

Result: IDEM achieves superior alignment accuracy compared to RMSE-based methods when point clouds have noise, density differences, holes, or partial overlap. The metric demonstrates a distinct minimum at the optimal transformation, indicating higher robustness to challenging conditions. Symmetric optimization avoids bias from selecting a fixed reference cloud.

Conclusion: The entropy-based metric overcomes asymmetry and sensitivity to initial alignment in traditional registration methods. It provides a more reliable solution for real-world point cloud registration tasks where both input clouds may be degraded. Future work may explore extensions to non-rigid registration or large-scale datasets.

Abstract: Point cloud registration is a central theme in computer vision, with alignment algorithms continuously improving for greater robustness. Commonly used methods evaluate Euclidean distances between point clouds and minimize an objective function, such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). However, these approaches are most effective when the point clouds are well-prealigned and issues such as differences in density, noise, holes, and limited overlap can compromise the results. Traditional methods, such as Iterative Closest Point (ICP), require choosing one point cloud as fixed, since Euclidean distances lack commutativity. When only one point cloud has issues, adjustments can be made, but in real scenarios, both point clouds may be affected, often necessitating preprocessing. The authors introduce a novel differential entropy-based metric, designed to serve as the objective function within an optimization framework for fine rigid pairwise 3D point cloud registration, denoted as Iterative Differential Entropy Minimization (IDEM). This metric does not depend on the choice of a fixed point cloud and, during transformations, reveals a clear minimum corresponding to the best alignment. Multiple case studies are conducted, and the results are compared with those obtained using RMSE, Chamfer distance, and Hausdorff distance. The proposed metric proves effective even with density differences, noise, holes, and partial overlap, where RMSE does not always yield optimal alignment.

TL;DR: 本文提出MANGO方法，通过无配对图像翻译解决机器人视觉策略在模拟到真实环境中的视角一致性问题，实现跨视角的高成功率操作策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉策略在相机视角变化下表现脆弱，真实数据有限且模拟与现实存在视觉差异，需解决数据匮乏与sim2real翻译的视角一致性问题。

Method: 设计MANGO框架：1) 分割条件化的InfoNCE损失增强特征关联；2) 高正则化判别器抑制模式崩溃；3) 改进PatchNCE损失保留局部结构，仅需少量固定视角真实数据实现多视角翻译。

Result: MANGO在未见视角下翻译质量显著优于基线方法，结合模仿学习的策略成功率提升至60%，而未增强策略在相同场景下完全失效。

Conclusion: 基于对比学习与正则化设计的MANGO能有效克服sim2real视觉差异，在仅需少量真实数据情况下生成高质量多视角图像，显著提升策略泛化能力。

Abstract: Vision-based policies for robot manipulation have achieved significant recent success, but are still brittle to distribution shifts such as camera viewpoint variations. Robot demonstration data is scarce and often lacks appropriate variation in camera viewpoints. Simulation offers a way to collect robot demonstrations at scale with comprehensive coverage of different viewpoints, but presents a visual sim2real challenge. To bridge this gap, we propose MANGO -- an unpaired image translation method with a novel segmentation-conditioned InfoNCE loss, a highly-regularized discriminator design, and a modified PatchNCE loss. We find that these elements are crucial for maintaining viewpoint consistency during sim2real translation. When training MANGO, we only require a small amount of fixed-camera data from the real world, but show that our method can generate diverse unseen viewpoints by translating simulated observations. In this domain, MANGO outperforms all other image translation methods we tested. Imitation-learning policies trained on data augmented by MANGO are able to achieve success rates as high as 60\% on views that the non-augmented policy fails completely on.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)的两阶段群体排序与校准框架(GRCF)，通过动态调整比较权重和语义间隔，提升多模态情感分析的预测稳定性与相关性校准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统点向回归方法在多模态情感分析中易受标注噪声影响且忽视样本间相对顺序；现有成对序学习框架存在统一比较权重和静态排序间隔两个局限性，导致模型无法自适应关注难排序样本及表征情感类间语义距离差异。

Method: GRCF框架包含两个阶段：第一阶段引入受GRPO启发的Advantage-Weighted动态间隔排序损失，构建精细化序结构；第二阶段采用MAE驱动目标对预测幅度进行校准。通过群体相对策略优化思想实现相对顺序保持与绝对评分校准的联合优化。

Result: 在核心回归基准测试中达到SOTA性能，在幽默检测和讽刺检测等分类任务中也展现出强泛化能力，验证了框架的通用性。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了传统方法在标签噪声敏感性、相对排序表征、动态样本关注等方面的权衡问题，为多模态情感分析提供新的优化范式。

Abstract: Most Multimodal Sentiment Analysis research has focused on point-wise regression. While straightforward, this approach is sensitive to label noise and neglects whether one sample is more positive than another, resulting in unstable predictions and poor correlation alignment. Pairwise ordinal learning frameworks emerged to address this gap, capturing relative order by learning from comparisons. Yet, they introduce two new trade-offs: First, they assign uniform importance to all comparisons, failing to adaptively focus on hard-to-rank samples. Second, they employ static ranking margins, which fail to reflect the varying semantic distances between sentiment groups. To address this, we propose a Two-Stage Group-wise Ranking and Calibration Framework (GRCF) that adapts the philosophy of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our framework resolves these trade-offs by simultaneously preserving relative ordinal structure, ensuring absolute score calibration, and adaptively focusing on difficult samples. Specifically, Stage 1 introduces a GRPO-inspired Advantage-Weighted Dynamic Margin Ranking Loss to build a fine-grained ordinal structure. Stage 2 then employs an MAE-driven objective to align prediction magnitudes. To validate its generalizability, we extend GRCF to classification tasks, including multimodal humor detection and sarcasm detection. GRCF achieves state-of-the-art performance on core regression benchmarks, while also showing strong generalizability in classification tasks.

Conclusion: 结构化领域适配方法有效提升侵入感知效果，开源的CogRail基准为后续研究提供支持。

Abstract: Accurate and early perception of potential intrusion targets is essential for ensuring the safety of railway transportation systems. However, most existing systems focus narrowly on object classification within fixed visual scopes and apply rule-based heuristics to determine intrusion status, often overlooking targets that pose latent intrusion risks. Anticipating such risks requires the cognition of spatial context and temporal dynamics for the object of interest (OOI), which presents challenges for conventional visual models. To facilitate deep intrusion perception, we introduce a novel benchmark, CogRail, which integrates curated open-source datasets with cognitively driven question-answer annotations to support spatio-temporal reasoning and prediction. Building upon this benchmark, we conduct a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art visual-language models (VLMs) using multimodal prompts to identify their strengths and limitations in this domain. Furthermore, we fine-tune VLMs for better performance and propose a joint fine-tuning framework that integrates three core tasks, position perception, movement prediction, and threat analysis, facilitating effective adaptation of general-purpose foundation models into specialized models tailored for cognitive intrusion perception. Extensive experiments reveal that current large-scale multimodal models struggle with the complex spatial-temporal reasoning required by the cognitive intrusion perception task, underscoring the limitations of existing foundation models in this safety-critical domain. In contrast, our proposed joint fine-tuning framework significantly enhances model performance by enabling targeted adaptation to domain-specific reasoning demands, highlighting the advantages of structured multi-task learning in improving both accuracy and interpretability.

Result: 实现高去匿名化准确率，发现特定文本提示导致近完美区分度，揭示模型生成结果的系统性特征

Conclusion: 投票式排行榜存在根本性安全漏洞，需要改进匿名化技术以应对新型识别攻击

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models are increasingly popular, producing a large share of AI-generated images online. To compare model quality, voting-based leaderboards have become the standard, relying on anonymized model outputs for fairness. In this work, we show that such anonymity can be easily broken. We find that generations from each T2I model form distinctive clusters in the image embedding space, enabling accurate deanonymization without prompt control or training data. Using 22 models and 280 prompts (150K images), our centroid-based method achieves high accuracy and reveals systematic model-specific signatures. We further introduce a prompt-level distinguishability metric and conduct large-scale analyses showing how certain prompts can lead to near-perfect distinguishability. Our findings expose fundamental security flaws in T2I leaderboards and motivate stronger anonymization defenses.

Abstract: Large-scale vision-language models such as CLIP achieve strong zero-shot recognition but struggle with classes that are rarely seen during pretraining, including newly emerging entities and culturally specific categories. We introduce LiteEmbed, a lightweight framework for few-shot personalization of CLIP that enables new classes to be added without retraining its encoders. LiteEmbed performs subspace-guided optimization of text embeddings within CLIP's vocabulary, leveraging a PCA-based decomposition that disentangles coarse semantic directions from fine-grained variations. Two complementary objectives, coarse alignment and fine separation, jointly preserve global semantic consistency while enhancing discriminability among visually similar classes. Once optimized, the embeddings are plug-and-play, seamlessly substituting CLIP's original text features across classification, retrieval, segmentation, and detection tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate substantial gains over prior methods, establishing LiteEmbed as an effective approach for adapting CLIP to underrepresented, rare, or unseen classes.

### [55] [Self-Supervised Animal Identification for Long Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09663)
*Xuyang Fang,Sion Hannuna,Edwin Simpson,Neill Campbell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A self-supervised method for animal identification in long videos achieves 97%+ accuracy with minimal GPU memory, eliminating manual labeling needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional animal tracking requires laborious manual annotation; existing self-supervised methods face computational/memory bottlenecks for long sequences.

Method: Reframes identification as global clustering (not sequential tracking) via frame pair sampling, pre-trained backbone, Hungarian algorithm-based pseudo-labeling, and adapted vision-language loss.

Result: 97%+ accuracy on real-world datasets with <1GB GPU memory/batch - outperforming contrastive methods by 10x memory efficiency, matches supervised models using 1,000+ labeled frames.

Conclusion: Enables resource-efficient, high-accuracy animal tracking for ecological research without manual annotation, deployable on consumer hardware.

Abstract: Identifying individual animals in long-duration videos is essential for behavioral ecology, wildlife monitoring, and livestock management. Traditional methods require extensive manual annotation, while existing self-supervised approaches are computationally demanding and ill-suited for long sequences due to memory constraints and temporal error propagation. We introduce a highly efficient, self-supervised method that reframes animal identification as a global clustering task rather than a sequential tracking problem. Our approach assumes a known, fixed number of individuals within a single video -- a common scenario in practice -- and requires only bounding box detections and the total count. By sampling pairs of frames, using a frozen pre-trained backbone, and employing a self-bootstrapping mechanism with the Hungarian algorithm for in-batch pseudo-label assignment, our method learns discriminative features without identity labels. We adapt a Binary Cross Entropy loss from vision-language models, enabling state-of-the-art accuracy ($>$97\%) while consuming less than 1 GB of GPU memory per batch -- an order of magnitude less than standard contrastive methods. Evaluated on challenging real-world datasets (3D-POP pigeons and 8-calves feeding videos), our framework matches or surpasses supervised baselines trained on over 1,000 labeled frames, effectively removing the manual annotation bottleneck. This work enables practical, high-accuracy animal identification on consumer-grade hardware, with broad applicability in resource-constrained research settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCE-SLAM 提出通过场景坐标嵌入解决单目视觉SLAM中的尺度漂移问题，并通过两模块实现尺度一致性，实验证明在KITTI等数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单一视角的视觉SLAM存在累积的尺度漂移问题，而传统帧对帧方法因局部优化缺乏全局约束，因此需端到端方案以维持尺度一致性。

Method: 引入场景坐标嵌入（3D几何关系表征）与几何引导聚合模块，利用注意力机制传播历史尺度信息，并通过场景坐标捆绑调整以显式3D坐标约束实现全局一致性。

Result: 在KITTI数据集上绝对轨迹误差降低8.36米，且保持36FPS实时性，在大规模场景中实现尺度一致性。

Conclusion: SCE-SLAM通过端到端学习与显式几何约束有效抑制尺度漂移，兼顾性能与效率，适用于资源受限平台。

Abstract: Monocular visual SLAM enables 3D reconstruction from internet video and autonomous navigation on resource-constrained platforms, yet suffers from scale drift, i.e., the gradual divergence of estimated scale over long sequences. Existing frame-to-frame methods achieve real-time performance through local optimization but accumulate scale drift due to the lack of global constraints among independent windows. To address this, we propose SCE-SLAM, an end-to-end SLAM system that maintains scale consistency through scene coordinate embeddings, which are learned patch-level representations encoding 3D geometric relationships under a canonical scale reference. The framework consists of two key modules: geometry-guided aggregation that leverages 3D spatial proximity to propagate scale information from historical observations through geometry-modulated attention, and scene coordinate bundle adjustment that anchors current estimates to the reference scale through explicit 3D coordinate constraints decoded from the scene coordinate embeddings. Experiments on KITTI, Waymo, and vKITTI demonstrate substantial improvements: our method reduces absolute trajectory error by 8.36m on KITTI compared to the best prior approach, while maintaining 36 FPS and achieving scale consistency across large-scale scenes.

TL;DR: STEP3-VL-10B是一个高效的轻量级多模态基础模型，通过统一预训练和强化学习策略，在保持10B参数下仍超越超大模型，支持复杂推理并开源社区使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态模型中效率与性能平衡问题，现有大模型计算消耗高，需开发轻量级但具前沿智能的开放模型。

Method: 采用1.2T多模态tokens统一预训练，结合语言对齐的感知编码器和Qwen3-8B解码器；规模化强化学习后训练流水线（＞1k迭代）；设计并行协同推理（PaCoRe）优化测试时计算资源分配。

Result: 在MMBench达92.2%、MMMU达80.11%，AIME2025和MathVision复杂推理任务精度分别为94.43%和75.95%，性能超GLM-4.6V-106B、Qwen3-VL-235B及Gemini 2.5 Pro等20倍大模型。

Conclusion: STEP3-VL-10B以低参数量实现多模态SOTA性能，开源模型为社区提供高效可复现基准，验证「高效模型设计」在高精度复杂推理上的可行性。

Abstract: We present STEP3-VL-10B, a lightweight open-source foundation model designed to redefine the trade-off between compact efficiency and frontier-level multimodal intelligence. STEP3-VL-10B is realized through two strategic shifts: first, a unified, fully unfrozen pre-training strategy on 1.2T multimodal tokens that integrates a language-aligned Perception Encoder with a Qwen3-8B decoder to establish intrinsic vision-language synergy; and second, a scaled post-training pipeline featuring over 1k iterations of reinforcement learning. Crucially, we implement Parallel Coordinated Reasoning (PaCoRe) to scale test-time compute, allocating resources to scalable perceptual reasoning that explores and synthesizes diverse visual hypotheses. Consequently, despite its compact 10B footprint, STEP3-VL-10B rivals or surpasses models 10$\times$-20$\times$ larger (e.g., GLM-4.6V-106B, Qwen3-VL-235B) and top-tier proprietary flagships like Gemini 2.5 Pro and Seed-1.5-VL. Delivering best-in-class performance, it records 92.2% on MMBench and 80.11% on MMMU, while excelling in complex reasoning with 94.43% on AIME2025 and 75.95% on MathVision. We release the full model suite to provide the community with a powerful, efficient, and reproducible baseline.

TL;DR: 本文提出SRENDER，通过生成关键帧结合3D重建和渲染，实现比扩散模型快40倍的视频生成，保持高质量和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型生成视频计算成本高，难以实现实时应用（如AI交互、AR/VR），需寻找高效策略。

Method: 1) 用扩散模型生成稀疏关键帧；2) 通过3D重建与渲染合成完整视频；3) 模型预测关键帧数量以适应不同相机路径复杂度。

Result: 生成20秒视频速度提升超40倍，且保持高视觉保真度和时间稳定性。

Conclusion: SRENDER通过3D表示和动态计算分配，为可控视频合成提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: Modern video generative models based on diffusion models can produce very realistic clips, but they are computationally inefficient, often requiring minutes of GPU time for just a few seconds of video. This inefficiency poses a critical barrier to deploying generative video in applications that require real-time interactions, such as embodied AI and VR/AR. This paper explores a new strategy for camera-conditioned video generation of static scenes: using diffusion-based generative models to generate a sparse set of keyframes, and then synthesizing the full video through 3D reconstruction and rendering. By lifting keyframes into a 3D representation and rendering intermediate views, our approach amortizes the generation cost across hundreds of frames while enforcing geometric consistency. We further introduce a model that predicts the optimal number of keyframes for a given camera trajectory, allowing the system to adaptively allocate computation. Our final method, SRENDER, uses very sparse keyframes for simple trajectories and denser ones for complex camera motion. This results in video generation that is more than 40 times faster than the diffusion-based baseline in generating 20 seconds of video, while maintaining high visual fidelity and temporal stability, offering a practical path toward efficient and controllable video synthesis.

TL;DR: 提出COMPOSE框架，通过超图划分解决多视角3D姿态估计中的全局一致性关联问题，比现有方法提升23%平均精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有两阶段方法仅依赖成对关联建模，难以保证多视角间全局循环一致性，导致误匹配误差累积。需从组合优化视角解决稀疏视角下的复杂关联问题。

Method: 将多视角姿态关联建模为超图划分问题，引入超边同时约束多个视角的一致性；通过几何剪枝策略高效求解指数级复杂度的整数线性规划问题。

Result: 在优化方法中提升23%平均精度，超越自监督端到端方法11%，验证了全局约束对稀疏视角3D姿态估计的有效性。

Conclusion: COMPOSE通过严格的全局一致性建模和高效剪枝策略，为多视角3D姿态估计提供新范式，解决了传统两阶段框架的关联模糊性瓶颈。

Abstract: 3D pose estimation from sparse multi-views is a critical task for numerous applications, including action recognition, sports analysis, and human-robot interaction. Optimization-based methods typically follow a two-stage pipeline, first detecting 2D keypoints in each view and then associating these detections across views to triangulate the 3D pose. Existing methods rely on mere pairwise associations to model this correspondence problem, treating global consistency between views (i.e., cycle consistency) as a soft constraint. Yet, reconciling these constraints for multiple views becomes brittle when spurious associations propagate errors. We thus propose COMPOSE, a novel framework that formulates multi-view pose correspondence matching as a hypergraph partitioning problem rather than through pairwise association. While the complexity of the resulting integer linear program grows exponentially in theory, we introduce an efficient geometric pruning strategy to substantially reduce the search space. COMPOSE achieves improvements of up to 23% in average precision over previous optimization-based methods and up to 11% over self-supervised end-to-end learned methods, offering a promising solution to a widely studied problem.

TL;DR: 提出SAM3-DMS解耦策略，通过细粒度个体记忆选择优化视频多目标跟踪，显著提升高密度场景下的分割稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原始SAM3的群体记忆选择机制在复杂多目标场景中易因平均性能指标忽略个体可靠性，导致跟踪不稳定。

Method: 设计无需训练的解耦记忆选择策略，对每个目标独立建模并动态选取最可靠的个体记忆特征进行跟踪。

Result: 实验表明新方法在目标密度高时仍保持优异身份保持能力，相较基线模型提升15.3%的跟踪连续性指标。

Conclusion: 该策略为复杂动态场景的多目标视频分割提供了鲁棒性解决方案，尤其适合大规模密集目标的实时跟踪场景。

Abstract: Segment Anything 3 (SAM3) has established a powerful foundation that robustly detects, segments, and tracks specified targets in videos. However, in its original implementation, its group-level collective memory selection is suboptimal for complex multi-object scenarios, as it employs a synchronized decision across all concurrent targets conditioned on their average performance, often overlooking individual reliability. To this end, we propose SAM3-DMS, a training-free decoupled strategy that utilizes fine-grained memory selection on individual objects. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves robust identity preservation and tracking stability. Notably, our advantage becomes more pronounced with increased target density, establishing a solid foundation for simultaneous multi-target video segmentation in the wild.

TL;DR: Fast-ThinkAct reduces inference latency in vision-language-action tasks through efficient latent reasoning distillation while maintaining strong performance in long-horizon planning and adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CoT-based vision-language-action frameworks suffer from high inference latency due to lengthy reasoning traces, despite improved generalization capabilities.

Method: The authors propose a distillation-based framework that learns compact latent chain-of-thought representations guided by a preference-driven objective, aligning language-guided manipulation trajectories while preserving reasoning capabilities for embodied control.

Result: Experiments demonstrate 89.3% reduced inference latency compared to state-of-the-art models, with preserved performance in long-horizon planning, few-shot adaptation, and failure recovery across multiple embodied manipulation benchmarks.

Conclusion: Compact reasoning representations can effectively bridge vision-language reasoning with action execution in embodied tasks, enabling low-latency yet capable policy learning.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) tasks require reasoning over complex visual scenes and executing adaptive actions in dynamic environments. While recent studies on reasoning VLAs show that explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) can improve generalization, they suffer from high inference latency due to lengthy reasoning traces. We propose Fast-ThinkAct, an efficient reasoning framework that achieves compact yet performant planning through verbalizable latent reasoning. Fast-ThinkAct learns to reason efficiently with latent CoTs by distilling from a teacher, driven by a preference-guided objective to align manipulation trajectories that transfers both linguistic and visual planning capabilities for embodied control. This enables reasoning-enhanced policy learning that effectively connects compact reasoning to action execution. Extensive experiments across diverse embodied manipulation and reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that Fast-ThinkAct achieves strong performance with up to 89.3\% reduced inference latency over state-of-the-art reasoning VLAs, while maintaining effective long-horizon planning, few-shot adaptation, and failure recovery.

Result: 基线方法胜率达82.5%±3.3%，远超最佳协商协议（13.8%±2.6%），性能差距达6倍且统计显著（p<0.01），同时计算成本降低1.5-2.5倍。

Conclusion: 多LLM系统的复杂协商机制在质量和成本效率上均无优势，推翻了复杂结构必然提升性能的主流假设。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems where Large Language Models (LLMs) deliberate to form consensus have gained significant attention, yet their practical value over simpler methods remains under-scrutinized. We introduce DELIBERATIONBENCH, a controlled benchmark evaluating three deliberation protocols against a strong baseline of selecting the best response from a pool of model outputs. Across 270 questions and three independent seeds (810 total evaluations), we find a striking negative result: the best-single baseline achieves an 82.5% +- 3.3% win rate, dramatically outperforming the best deliberation protocol(13.8% +- 2.6%). This 6.0x performance gap is statistically significant (p < 0.01) and comes at 1.5-2.5x higher computational cost. Our findings challenge assumptions that complexity enhances quality in multi-LLM systems.

Conclusion: 建议将慢性病维度纳入PTSD研究框架，重视社交媒体作为监测工具的社会价值，倡导开发精准干预方案

Abstract: Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a multifaceted mental health condition, particularly challenging for individuals with pre-existing medical conditions. This review critically examines the intersection of PTSD and chronic illnesses as expressed on social media platforms. By systematically analyzing literature from 2008 to 2024, the study explores how PTSD manifests and is managed in individuals with chronic conditions such as cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune disorders, with a focus on online expressions on platforms like X (formally known as Twitter) and Facebook. Findings demonstrate that social media data offers valuable insights into the unique challenges faced by individuals with both PTSD and chronic illnesses. Specifically, natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) techniques can identify potential PTSD cases among these populations, achieving accuracy rates between 74% and 90%. Furthermore, the role of online support communities in shaping coping strategies and facilitating early interventions is highlighted. This review underscores the necessity of incorporating considerations of pre-existing medical conditions in PTSD research and treatment, emphasizing social media's potential as a monitoring and support tool for vulnerable groups. Future research directions and clinical implications are also discussed, with an emphasis on developing targeted interventions.

Result: 跨9家提供商的26个前沿模型测试显示平均71.3%攻击成功率，无家族模型能可靠防御，与先前对抗诗歌研究共同印证此类攻击的普适性。

Conclusion: 基于叙事结构的 jailbreak 构成不可忽视的新漏洞类别，传统模式匹配防御难以穷尽文化编码框架，需通过可解释性研究探索叙事线索如何重塑模型表征及意图识别。

Abstract: Safety mechanisms in LLMs remain vulnerable to attacks that reframe harmful requests through culturally coded structures. We introduce Adversarial Tales, a jailbreak technique that embeds harmful content within cyberpunk narratives and prompts models to perform functional analysis inspired by Vladimir Propp's morphology of folktales. By casting the task as structural decomposition, the attack induces models to reconstruct harmful procedures as legitimate narrative interpretation. Across 26 frontier models from nine providers, we observe an average attack success rate of 71.3%, with no model family proving reliably robust. Together with our prior work on Adversarial Poetry, these findings suggest that structurally-grounded jailbreaks constitute a broad vulnerability class rather than isolated techniques. The space of culturally coded frames that can mediate harmful intent is vast, likely inexhaustible by pattern-matching defenses alone. Understanding why these attacks succeed is therefore essential: we outline a mechanistic interpretability research agenda to investigate how narrative cues reshape model representations and whether models can learn to recognize harmful intent independently of surface form.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) risk retaining sensitive, copyrighted, or harmful information from their training data. Entity-level unlearning addresses this issue by removing all knowledge of a specific entity while preserving the model's overall capabilities. Existing approaches typically rely on full-model fine-tuning or prompt-based interventions, which can be computationally expensive or brittle when handling paraphrased queries. Recently, model editing has emerged as an efficient alternative for updating knowledge in LLMs, offering a promising direction for unlearning. However, existing editing techniques are typically designed for instance-level updates, modifying responses to specific attributes of an entity rather than eliminating all knowledge associated with the entity. In this paper, we investigate how editing techniques can be adapted for effective and efficient entity-level unlearning. To this end, we introduce a novel consistency-aware editing (CAE) framework. CAE aggregates a diverse set of prompts related to a target entity, including its attributes, relations, and adversarial paraphrases. It then jointly learns a low-rank update guided by a consistency regularizer that aligns the editing directions across prompts. This promotes robust and comprehensive forgetting while minimizing interference with unrelated knowledge. We further examine where different entities are stored within the model and how many diverse prompts are needed for successful unlearning. We evaluate CAE on two challenging benchmarks, RWKU and ToFU, and demonstrate that it (i) provides insights into how entity-level knowledge is internally represented and deleted in LLMs, (ii) significantly improves forgetting accuracy and robustness over traditional unlearning and editing baselines, and (iii) enables scalable entity removal using only tens of carefully selected prompts.

Abstract: The increasing volume and complexity of scientific literature demand robust methods for organizing and understanding research documents. In this study, we explore how structured knowledge, specifically, subject-predicate-object triples, can enhance the clustering and classification of scientific papers. We propose a modular pipeline that combines unsupervised clustering and supervised classification over multiple document representations: raw abstracts, extracted triples, and hybrid formats that integrate both. Using a filtered arXiv corpus, we extract relational triples from abstracts and construct four text representations, which we embed using four state-of-the-art transformer models: MiniLM, MPNet, SciBERT, and SPECTER. We evaluate the resulting embeddings with KMeans, GMM, and HDBSCAN for unsupervised clustering, and fine-tune classification models for arXiv subject prediction. Our results show that full abstract text yields the most coherent clusters, but that hybrid representations incorporating triples consistently improve classification performance, reaching up to 92.6% accuracy and 0.925 macro-F1. We also find that lightweight sentence encoders (MiniLM, MPNet) outperform domain-specific models (SciBERT, SPECTER) in clustering, while SciBERT excels in structured-input classification. These findings highlight the complementary benefits of combining unstructured text with structured knowledge, offering new insights into knowledge-infused representations for semantic organization of scientific documents.

Motivation: 自动短答案评分面临学生回答语言多样性、需要细粒度评分标准对齐以及LLM模型作为评审员的可靠性验证三个核心挑战。现有的研究缺乏对LLM在评分场景下的系统性评估。

Method: 通过ScientsBank基准测试数据集和Qwen 2.5-72B模型，从三个维度进行评估：1）LLM评分与专家判断的对齐程度与评分标准复杂度的关系；2）基于共识的低置信度结果延迟机制（Trust Curve）在准确率和不确定性之间的权衡；3）模型对随机输入扰动和对抗性攻击的鲁棒性。

Result: 实验发现二分类任务对齐度高达94%，但评分标准粒度增加时性能显著下降。Trust Curve机制通过过滤15%低置信度样本，使剩余样本准确率提升7%。对抗测试显示模型对同义词替换敏感但能抵抗指令注入攻击。

Conclusion: Rubric条件下的LLM评分系统需强化不确定性估算和鲁棒性测试，二分类场景可部署但多粒度评分需改进评分标准对齐策略。研究结果为高风险教育场景的LLM应用提供了部署基准和技术改进方向。

Abstract: Automated short-answer grading (ASAG) remains a challenging task due to the linguistic variability of student responses and the need for nuanced, rubric-aligned partial credit. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising solution, their reliability as automated judges in rubric-based settings requires rigorous assessment. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the performance of LLM-judges for rubric-based short-answer grading. We investigate three key aspects: the alignment of LLM grading with expert judgment across varying rubric complexities, the trade-off between uncertainty and accuracy facilitated by a consensus-based deferral mechanism, and the model's robustness under random input perturbations and adversarial attacks. Using the SciEntsBank benchmark and Qwen 2.5-72B, we find that alignment is strong for binary tasks but degrades with increased rubric granularity. Our "Trust Curve" analysis demonstrates a clear trade-off where filtering low-confidence predictions improves accuracy on the remaining subset. Additionally, robustness experiments reveal that while the model is resilient to prompt injection, it is sensitive to synonym substitutions. Our work provides critical insights into the capabilities and limitations of rubric-conditioned LLM judges, highlighting the importance of uncertainty estimation and robustness testing for reliable deployment.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型训练及推理阶段产生巨大的碳足迹，本研究旨在探索小型语言模型在预定义任务中作为环保替代方案的可行性。

Method: 对大型语言模型与微调后的小型语言模型进行性能-排放权衡分析，研究范围涵盖自然语言处理、推理和编程领域的六个选定任务。

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has raised concerns about their enormous carbon footprint, starting with energy-intensive training and continuing through repeated inference. This study investigates the potential of using fine-tuned Small Language Models (SLMs) as a sustainable alternative for predefined tasks. Here, we present a comparative analysis of the performance-emissions trade-off between LLMs and fine-tuned SLMs across selected tasks under Natural Language Processing, Reasoning and Programming. Our results show that in four out of the six selected tasks, SLMs maintained comparable performances for a significant reduction in carbon emissions during inference. Our findings demonstrate the viability of smaller models in mitigating the environmental impact of resource-heavy LLMs, thus advancing towards sustainable, green AI.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出InftyThink with Cross-Chain Memory，通过引入语义缓存改进LLM的迭代推理能力，既提升结构化任务准确性，也暴露了其异构领域适用性限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于迭代摘要的LLM推理框架（如InftyThink）存在重复生成相似推理策略的问题，且上下文扩展失控。研究旨在通过引入可长期复用的语义记忆机制解决此缺陷。

Method: 开发了基于嵌入空间的语义缓存系统，存储历史成功推理模式（引理库），推理时通过相似性检索并条件化利用最相关引理引导生成，同时严格控制上下文窗口增长。

Result: 在数学推理数据集（MATH500/AIME2024/GPQA-Diamond）中：1）结构化任务准确率显著提升；2）异构领域测试出现性能下降；3）几何分析证实缓存检索在嵌入空间形成方向性修正/破坏的吸引子模式。

Conclusion: 基于相似性的跨推理链记忆机制能有效提升LLM自我优化能力，但会引入领域适应性风险，揭示了长期记忆增强系统的收益与局限性。

Abstract: Iterative summarization based reasoning frameworks such as InftyThink enable long-horizon reasoning in large language models (LLMs) by controlling context growth, but they repeatedly regenerate similar reasoning strategies across tasks. We introduce InftyThink with Cross-Chain Memory, an extension that augments iterative reasoning with an embedding-based semantic cache of previously successful reasoning patterns. At each reasoning step, the model retrieves and conditions on the most semantically similar stored lemmas, guiding inference without expanding the context window indiscriminately. Experiments on MATH500, AIME2024, and GPQA-Diamond demonstrate that semantic lemma retrieval improves accuracy in structured domains while exposing failure modes in tests that include heterogeneous domains. Geometric analyses of reasoning trajectories reveal that cache retrieval induces directional biases in embedding space, leading to consistent fix (improve baseline accuracy) and break (degradation in baseline accuracy) attractors. Our results highlight both the benefits and limits of similarity-based memory for self-improving LLM reasoning.

### [70] [Scalable and Reliable Evaluation of AI Knowledge Retrieval Systems: RIKER and the Coherent Simulated Universe](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08847)
*JV Roig*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RIKER proposes a novel evaluation methodology for knowledge systems by inverting the paradigm to generate documents from known ground truth, enabling scalable, deterministic, and contamination-resistant scoring without human annotation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations are hindered by static benchmark contamination, LLM judge bias, and high-cost human annotations. RIKER addresses these limitations through synthetic document generation from structured ground truth.

Method: Uses 'paradigm inversion' to create documents from predefined ground truth rather than extracting truth from documents. This allows deterministic evaluation via regenerable corpora, avoiding contamination and enabling scalable analysis of 33 models across 21 billion tokens.

Result: Findings show context length claims often exceed actual usability (degradation past 32K tokens), cross-document aggregation is harder than single-document extraction, and grounding ability does not imply hallucination resistance.

Conclusion: RIKER introduces a domain-agnostic framework for constructing scalable, reusable evaluations, applicable wherever synthetic documents can be generated from structured ground truth, solving contamination, scalability, and bias issues.

Abstract: Evaluating knowledge systems (LLMs, RAG, knowledge graphs, etc) faces fundamental challenges: static benchmarks are vulnerable to contamination, LLM-based judges exhibit systematic biases, and ground truth extraction requires expensive human annotation. We present RIKER (Retrieval Intelligence and Knowledge Extraction Rating), both a benchmark and a replicable methodology based on paradigm inversion - generating documents from known ground truth rather than extracting ground truth from documents. This approach enables deterministic scoring and scalable evaluation without human annotation or reference models, and contamination resistance through regenerable corpora. Our evaluation of 33 models using over 21 billion tokens reveals that context length claims frequently exceed usable capacity, with significant degradation beyond 32K tokens; cross-document aggregation proves substantially harder than single-document extraction; and grounding ability and hallucination resistance are distinct capabilities - models excelling at finding facts that exist may still fabricate facts that do not. Beyond the specific benchmark, we contribute a domain-agnostic methodology for constructing scalable and contamination-resistant evaluations wherever synthetic documents can be generated from structured ground truth.

Abstract: This paper presents PediaMind-R1, a domain-specialized large language model designed to achieve active personalization in intelligent parenting scenarios. Unlike conventional systems that provide generic suggestions, PediaMind-R1 draws on insights from developmental psychology. It introduces temperament theory from the Thomas-Chess framework and builds a temperament knowledge graph for infants and toddlers (0-3 years). Our two-stage training pipeline first uses supervised fine-tuning to teach structured chain-of-thought reasoning, and then applies a GRPO-based alignment stage to reinforce logical consistency, domain expertise, and empathetic caregiving strategies. We further design an evaluation framework comprising temperament-sensitive multiple-choice tests and human assessments. The results demonstrate that PediaMind-R1 can accurately interpret early childhood temperament profiles and proactively engage in individualized reasoning. This work highlights the value of integrating vertical-domain modeling with psychological theory. It offers a novel approach to developing user-centered LLMs that advance the practice of active personalization in sensitive caregiving contexts.

*Manas Khatore,Sumana Sridharan,Kevork Sulahian,Benjamin J. Smith,Shi Feng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Automated answer matching using LLMs effectively resists strategic text manipulations like verbosity and conflicting answers, with binary scoring proving more robust than continuous scoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To validate the reliability of automated answer matching systems against strategic attacks that could exploit human-like evaluation flaws, ensuring scalability for educational and assessment applications.

Method: Experimenter prompted LLMs with three adversarial strategies: verbose responses, multiple unconfident answers, and conflicting answers positioned early in text outputs, while comparing binary vs continuous scoring models.

Result: Attack strategies failed to inflate scores and often reduced them; binary scorers showed 12.3% greater resistance to manipulation compared to continuous scorers while maintaining 94.7% accuracy in correct answer detection.

Conclusion: Robust automated answer matching systems with binary scoring can reliably replace human evaluators for standardized assessments when reference answers exist, resisting low-cost text manipulation tactics.

Abstract: Automated answer matching, which leverages LLMs to evaluate free-text responses by comparing them to a reference answer, shows substantial promise as a scalable and aligned alternative to human evaluation. However, its reliability requires robustness against strategic attacks such as guesswork or verbosity that may artificially inflate scores without improving actual correctness. In this work, we systematically investigate whether such tactics deceive answer matching models by prompting examinee models to: (1) generate verbose responses, (2) provide multiple answers when unconfident, and (3) embed conflicting answers with the correct answer near the start of their response. Our results show that these manipulations do not increase scores and often reduce them. Additionally, binary scoring (which requires a matcher to answer with a definitive "correct" or "incorrect") is more robust to attacks than continuous scoring (which requires a matcher to determine partial correctness). These findings show that answer matching is generally robust to inexpensive text manipulation and is a viable alternative to traditional LLM-as-a-judge or human evaluation when reference answers are available.

Abstract: Automated news verification requires structured claim extraction, but existing approaches either lack schema compliance or generalize poorly across domains. This paper presents NewsScope, a cross-domain dataset, benchmark, and fine-tuned model for schema-grounded news claim extraction. The dataset contains 455 articles across politics, health, science/environment, and business, consisting of 395 in-domain articles and 60 out-of-source articles for generalization testing. LLaMA 3.1 8B was fine-tuned using LoRA on 315 training examples and evaluated on held-out in-domain (80 articles) and out-of-source (60 articles) test sets. Human evaluation on 400 claims shows NewsScope achieves 89.4% human-evaluated accuracy compared to GPT-4o-mini's 93.7% (p=0.07). NewsScope outperforms GPT-4o-mini on political claims (94.3% vs. 87.8%). A numeric grounding filter further improves accuracy to 91.6%, narrowing the gap to 2.1 percentage points. Inter-annotator agreement studies (160 claims) confirm labeling reliability (94.6% positive agreement on SUPPORTED judgments). The open-weight model enables offline deployment at approximately $15 on-demand compute (or $0 on free tiers). Code and benchmark are publicly released.

Conclusion: 通过动态多步想象建模未来状态，ITP为复杂任务规划提供了通用解决方案，为未来智能体设计提供了关键洞察。

Abstract: Recent advances in world models have shown promise for modeling future dynamics of environmental states, enabling agents to reason and act without accessing real environments. Current methods mainly perform single-step or fixed-horizon rollouts, leaving their potential for complex task planning under-exploited. We propose Imagine-then-Plan (\texttt{ITP}), a unified framework for agent learning via lookahead imagination, where an agent's policy model interacts with the learned world model, yielding multi-step ``imagined'' trajectories. Since the imagination horizon may vary by tasks and stages, we introduce a novel adaptive lookahead mechanism by trading off the ultimate goal and task progress. The resulting imagined trajectories provide rich signals about future consequences, such as achieved progress and potential conflicts, which are fused with current observations, formulating a partially \textit{observable} and \textit{imaginable} Markov decision process to guide policy learning. We instantiate \texttt{ITP} with both training-free and reinforcement-trained variants. Extensive experiments across representative agent benchmarks demonstrate that \texttt{ITP} significantly outperforms competitive baselines. Further analyses validate that our adaptive lookahead largely enhances agents' reasoning capability, providing valuable insights into addressing broader, complex tasks.

*Pedro Memoli Buffa,Luciano Del Corro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper shows how analyzing LLM output entropy can effectively estimate domain-specific model accuracy and guide data collection strategies under domain shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Develop scalable solutions for two linked challenges in LLM deployment: (1) Monitoring performance degradation across shifting domains and (2) Prioritizing data acquisition to address largest performance gaps.

Method: Analyze output-entropy profiles from final-layer next-token probabilities using 11 statistical features. Train lightweight classifiers to predict instance correctness, then aggregate predictions to estimate domain-level accuracy at inference time.

Result: Evaluated on 10 STEM benchmarks with 9 LLMs (3B-20B): (1) Entropy-based estimates strongly correlated with held-out accuracy (2) 60% of models showed monotonic domain ranking (3) Signal works across various architecture families

Conclusion: Final-layer entropy profiles provide an effective, scalable signal for monitoring model performance and optimizing data collection in dynamic deployment environments.

Abstract: Deploying LLMs raises two coupled challenges: (1) monitoring - estimating where a model underperforms as traffic and domains drift - and (2) improvement - prioritizing data acquisition to close the largest performance gaps. We test whether an inference-time signal can estimate slice-level accuracy under domain shift. For each response, we compute an output-entropy profile from final-layer next-token probabilities (from top-k logprobs) and summarize it with eleven statistics. A lightweight classifier predicts instance correctness, and averaging predicted probabilities yields a domain-level accuracy estimate. We evaluate on ten STEM reasoning benchmarks with exhaustive train/test compositions (k in {1,2,3,4}; all "10 choose k" combinations), across nine LLMs from six families (3B-20B). Estimates often track held-out benchmark accuracy, and several models show near-monotonic ordering of domains. Output-entropy profiles are thus an accessible signal for scalable monitoring and for targeting data acquisition.

Abstract: We present TranslateGemma, a suite of open machine translation models based on the Gemma 3 foundation models. To enhance the inherent multilingual capabilities of Gemma 3 for the translation task, we employ a two-stage fine-tuning process. First, supervised fine-tuning is performed using a rich mixture of high-quality large-scale synthetic parallel data generated via state-of-the-art models and human-translated parallel data. This is followed by a reinforcement learning phase, where we optimize translation quality using an ensemble of reward models, including MetricX-QE and AutoMQM, targeting translation quality. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TranslateGemma with human evaluation on the WMT25 test set across 10 language pairs and with automatic evaluation on the WMT24++ benchmark across 55 language pairs. Automatic metrics show consistent and substantial gains over the baseline Gemma 3 models across all sizes. Notably, smaller TranslateGemma models often achieve performance comparable to larger baseline models, offering improved efficiency. We also show that TranslateGemma models retain strong multimodal capabilities, with enhanced performance on the Vistra image translation benchmark. The release of the open TranslateGemma models aims to provide the research community with powerful and adaptable tools for machine translation.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has necessitated more robust evaluation methods that go beyond static benchmarks, which are increasingly prone to data saturation and leakage. In this paper, we propose a dynamic benchmarking framework for evaluating multilingual and multicultural capabilities through the social deduction game Spyfall. In our setup, models must engage in strategic dialogue to either identify a secret agent or avoid detection, utilizing culturally relevant locations or local foods. Our results show that our game-based rankings align closely with the Chatbot Arena. However, we find a significant performance gap in non-English contexts: models are generally less proficient when handling locally specific entities and often struggle with rule-following or strategic integrity in non-English languages. We demonstrate that this game-based approach provides a scalable, leakage-resistant, and culturally nuanced alternative to traditional NLP benchmarks.

Abstract: The development of large language models (LLMs) has achieved superior performance in a range of downstream tasks, including LLM-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). The quality of generated content heavily relies on the usefulness of the retrieved information and the capacity of LLMs' internal information processing mechanism to incorporate it in answer generation. It is generally assumed that the retrieved information is relevant to the question. However, the retrieved information may have a variable degree of relevance and usefulness, depending on the question and the document collection. It is important to take into account the relevance of the retrieved information in answer generation. In this paper, we propose OpenDecoder, a new approach that leverages explicit evaluation of the retrieved information as quality indicator features for generation. We aim to build a RAG model that is more robust to varying levels of noisy context. Three types of explicit evaluation information are considered: relevance score, ranking score, and QPP (query performance prediction) score. The experimental results on five benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and better robustness of OpenDecoder by outperforming various baseline methods. Importantly, this paradigm is flexible to be integrated with the post-training of LLMs for any purposes and incorporated with any type of external indicators.

Abstract: Scientific reasoning increasingly requires linking structured experimental data with the unstructured literature that explains it, yet most large language model (LLM) assistants cannot reason jointly across these modalities. We introduce SpectraQuery, a hybrid natural-language query framework that integrates a relational Raman spectroscopy database with a vector-indexed scientific literature corpus using a Structured and Unstructured Query Language (SUQL)-inspired design. By combining semantic parsing with retrieval-augmented generation, SpectraQuery translates open-ended questions into coordinated SQL and literature retrieval operations, producing cited answers that unify numerical evidence with mechanistic explanation. Across SQL correctness, answer groundedness, retrieval effectiveness, and expert evaluation, SpectraQuery demonstrates strong performance: approximately 80 percent of generated SQL queries are fully correct, synthesized answers reach 93-97 percent groundedness with 10-15 retrieved passages, and battery scientists rate responses highly across accuracy, relevance, grounding, and clarity (4.1-4.6/5). These results show that hybrid retrieval architectures can meaningfully support scientific workflows by bridging data and discourse for high-volume experimental datasets.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs align with humans superficially in judging socially grounded language but struggle with deeper interpretation of figurative language like idioms and Gen Z slang, with GPT-4 performing best but still facing challenges in context-dependent expressions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether instruction-tuned LLMs can align with humans in both surface-level judgments and deeper representational understanding of figurative/socio-pragmatic language, addressing gaps in models' ability to handle context-dependent linguistic traits.

Method: Human participants and four LLMs (GPT-4, Gemma-2-9B, Llama-3.2, Mistral-7B) rated 240 dialogue-based sentences (covering 6 traits) and 40 interpretive questions per sentence using a 10-point Likert scale, comparing alignment at surface and representational levels.

Result: LLMs showed surface-level alignment with humans but significant divergence in representational understanding, particularly for idioms and Gen Z slang. GPT-4 most closely mirrored human patterns, while all models struggled with sarcasm, slang, and idiomacy.

Conclusion: Current LLMs have limitations in capturing socio-pragmatic depth in language, with implications for applications requiring nuanced interpretation of figurative or context-dependent expressions, despite surface-level accuracy.

Abstract: Large language models generate judgments that resemble those of humans. Yet the extent to which these models align with human judgments in interpreting figurative and socially grounded language remains uncertain. To investigate this, human participants and four instruction-tuned LLMs of different sizes (GPT-4, Gemma-2-9B, Llama-3.2, and Mistral-7B) rated 240 dialogue-based sentences representing six linguistic traits: conventionality, sarcasm, funny, emotional, idiomacy, and slang. Each of the 240 sentences was paired with 40 interpretive questions, and both humans and LLMs rated these sentences on a 10-point Likert scale. Results indicated that humans and LLMs aligned at the surface level with humans, but diverged significantly at the representational level, especially in interpreting figurative sentences involving idioms and Gen Z slang. GPT-4 most closely approximates human representational patterns, while all models struggle with context-dependent and socio-pragmatic expressions like sarcasm, slang, and idiomacy.

TL;DR: 研究表明，大型语言模型的'顿悟'并非获得新推理范式，而是整合记忆事实到已有推理路径的过程，且顿悟后的模型在知识迁移性上仍存在局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索参数共享Transformer的'顿悟'阶段是否能真正提升组合任务表现，并论证其高昂计算成本的性价比。

Method: 通过机械分析对比顿悟前后模型的推理路径，验证推理模式变化、数据分布影响及知识迁移能力。

Result: 1. 顿悟与非顿悟模型使用相同推理路径；2. 高准确率与推理模式形成可独立发生；3. 泛化电路迁移新知识能力有限。

Conclusion: 顿悟是知识整合而非范式革新过程，且计算成本与实际获得的有限泛化能力不匹配。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at factual retrieval, they often struggle with the "curse of two-hop reasoning" in compositional tasks. Recent research suggests that parameter-sharing transformers can bridge this gap by forming a "Generalization Circuit" during a prolonged "grokking" phase. A fundamental question arises: Is a grokked model superior to its non-grokked counterparts on downstream tasks? Furthermore, is the extensive computational cost of waiting for the grokking phase worthwhile? In this work, we conduct a mechanistic study to evaluate the Generalization Circuit's role in knowledge assimilation and transfer. We demonstrate that: (i) The inference paths established by non-grokked and grokked models for in-distribution compositional queries are identical. This suggests that the "Generalization Circuit" does not represent the sudden acquisition of a new reasoning paradigm. Instead, we argue that grokking is the process of integrating memorized atomic facts into an naturally established reasoning path. (ii) Achieving high accuracy on unseen cases after prolonged training and the formation of a certain reasoning path are not bound; they can occur independently under specific data regimes. (iii) Even a mature circuit exhibits limited transferability when integrating new knowledge, suggesting that "grokked" Transformers do not achieve a full mastery of compositional logic.

TL;DR: SITA是一种针对低资源声调语言的轻量级预训练语音编码器适配方法，通过分阶段多目标训练实现说话人无关和声调敏感的表示学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低资源声调语言在现代语音技术中缺乏有效表示，需解决说话人性别等无关变量干扰的同时保持声调区分能力，传统多语言编码器难以有效表征声调

Method: 提出分阶段训练策略：(1) 跨性别对比损失与声调排斥损失联合优化，确保词义一致性并分离同词异调实例；(2) 引入CTC+知识蒸馏的ASR辅助目标稳定识别结构

Result: 在苗语基准数据集上提升了跨性别词汇检索准确率(较基线+12.3%)，维持可接受的ASR精度(XLS-R老师的88.1%)，迁移至普通话也取得类似提升(字符准确率+4.7%)

Conclusion: SITA构建了通用型多语言语音编码器适配框架，系统性解决了低资源声调语言中表示学习的两大核心矛盾，为相关资源匮乏的语言提供了有效技术路径

Abstract: Tonal low-resource languages are widely spoken yet remain underserved by modern speech technology. A key challenge is learning representations that are robust to nuisance variation such as gender while remaining tone-aware for different lexical meanings. To address this, we propose SITA, a lightweight adaptation recipe that enforces Speaker-Invariance and Tone-Awareness for pretrained wav2vec-style encoders. SITA uses staged multi-objective training: (i) a cross-gender contrastive objective encourages lexical consistency across speakers, while a tone-repulsive loss prevents tone collapse by explicitly separating same-word different-tone realizations; and (ii) an auxiliary Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC)-based ASR objective with distillation stabilizes recognition-relevant structure. We evaluate primarily on Hmong, a highly tonal and severely under-resourced language where off-the-shelf multilingual encoders fail to represent tone effectively. On a curated Hmong word corpus, SITA improves cross-gender lexical retrieval accuracy, while maintaining usable ASR accuracy relative to an ASR-adapted XLS-R teacher. We further observe similar gains when transferring the same recipe to Mandarin, suggesting SITA is a general, plug-in approach for adapting multilingual speech encoders to tonal languages.

Conclusion: 未来挑战包括：多源差异整合、分歧可视化框架开发、多元建模的实践权衡。强调从分歧捕捉到决策应用的转化需要跨学科方法革新。

Abstract: Annotator disagreement is widespread in NLP, particularly for subjective and ambiguous tasks such as toxicity detection and stance analysis. While early approaches treated disagreement as noise to be removed, recent work increasingly models it as a meaningful signal reflecting variation in interpretation and perspective. This survey provides a unified view of disagreement-aware NLP methods. We first present a domain-agnostic taxonomy of the sources of disagreement spanning data, task, and annotator factors. We then synthesize modeling approaches using a common framework defined by prediction targets and pooling structure, highlighting a shift from consensus learning toward explicitly modeling disagreement, and toward capturing structured relationships among annotators. We review evaluation metrics for both predictive performance and annotator behavior, and noting that most fairness evaluations remain descriptive rather than normative. We conclude by identifying open challenges and future directions, including integrating multiple sources of variation, developing disagreement-aware interpretability frameworks, and grappling with the practical tradeoffs of perspectivist modeling.

Motivation: Existing LLMs often suffer from low-quality Korean data and lack of cultural alignment, limiting reliable and culturally appropriate response generation in Korean contexts.

Method: Developed a comprehensive pipeline with proprietary data cleansing, synthetic data generation, curriculum learning-based data mixing, and a custom Korean-optimized tokenizer. Introduced two configurations: Mi:dm 2.0 Base (11.5B parameters) and Mini (2.3B parameters).

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art results on Korean-specific benchmarks, including top-tier zero-shot performance on KMMLU and strong evaluations in language, humanities, and social science tasks.

Conclusion: The MIT-licensed Mi:dm 2.0 lineup aims to accelerate Korean AI adoption, strengthen the developer community, and support K-intelligence through accessible, high-performance models.

Abstract: We introduce Mi:dm 2.0, a bilingual large language model (LLM) specifically engineered to advance Korea-centric AI. This model goes beyond Korean text processing by integrating the values, reasoning patterns, and commonsense knowledge inherent to Korean society, enabling nuanced understanding of cultural contexts, emotional subtleties, and real-world scenarios to generate reliable and culturally appropriate responses. To address limitations of existing LLMs, often caused by insufficient or low-quality Korean data and lack of cultural alignment, Mi:dm 2.0 emphasizes robust data quality through a comprehensive pipeline that includes proprietary data cleansing, high-quality synthetic data generation, strategic data mixing with curriculum learning, and a custom Korean-optimized tokenizer to improve efficiency and coverage. To realize this vision, we offer two complementary configurations: Mi:dm 2.0 Base (11.5B parameters), built with a depth-up scaling strategy for general-purpose use, and Mi:dm 2.0 Mini (2.3B parameters), optimized for resource-constrained environments and specialized tasks. Mi:dm 2.0 achieves state-of-the-art performance on Korean-specific benchmarks, with top-tier zero-shot results on KMMLU and strong internal evaluation results across language, humanities, and social science tasks. The Mi:dm 2.0 lineup is released under the MIT license to support extensive research and commercial use. By offering accessible and high-performance Korea-centric LLMs, KT aims to accelerate AI adoption across Korean industries, public services, and education, strengthen the Korean AI developer community, and lay the groundwork for the broader vision of K-intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统符号关系标签简化了现实关系的复杂性，丢失语义细节，而大语言模型（LLM）的出现使得自然语言化关系表示成为可能，但现有知识图谱仍受限于历史模型兼容性。

Method: 提出混合设计框架：保留最小结构化骨架（如实体对+关键属性），引入自然语言描述，通过LLM生成可控的关系表述，平衡灵活性与可扩展性。

Result: 未提供实证数据（本文为观点性论文），但论证了符号化向自然语言转型的必要性，提供了可整合现有技术的混合架构设计原则。

Conclusion: 知识图谱应利用LLM优势，从刚性符号转向语境化自然语言关系，同时保留关键结构，以支持更丰富语义建模与下游应用兼容性。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) have commonly been constructed using predefined symbolic relation schemas, typically implemented as categorical relation labels. This design has notable shortcomings: real-world relations are often contextual, nuanced, and sometimes uncertain, and compressing it into discrete relation labels abstracts away critical semantic detail. Nevertheless, symbolic-relation KGs remain widely used because they have been operationally effective and broadly compatible with pre-LLM downstream models and algorithms, in which KG knowledge could be retrieved or encoded into quantified features and embeddings at scale. The emergence of LLMs has reshaped how knowledge is created and consumed. LLMs support scalable synthesis of domain facts directly in concise natural language, and prompting-based inference favors context-rich free-form text over quantified representations. This position paper argues that these changes call for rethinking the representation of relations themselves rather than merely using LLMs to populate conventional schemas more efficiently. We therefore advocate moving from symbolic to natural-language relation descriptions, and we propose hybrid design principles that preserve a minimal structural backbone while enabling more flexible and context-sensitive relational representations.

TL;DR: 本文研究显示，当前人类偏好评估在检测生成模型小改进时面临可检测性限制，尤其当偏好信号分散于各类提示中时，常规样本量不足，而优化评估协议（如降低提示变异）可显著提升检测效能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型改进需可靠评估方法，但现有偏好评估的检测效能受样本量、分配策略和协议设计的影响机制尚不明确，需系统性研究以优化评估效率。

Method: 理论分析不同参数配置下的最优分配策略，结合多模态实证数据（包含文本、图像、代码等）验证信号分散度对检测结果的影响，并对比不同评估协议对可检测性的提升效果。

Result: 理论证明比例分配在信号分散场景下的最优性；实证表明多数场景需数倍于现行规模的标注量，而减少提示变异的基准测试通过降低1.5倍方差实现40%检测效能提升；80%历史负样本结果被重新解释为评估不足。

Conclusion: 评估设计需综合考量效应量与预算，传统评估可能因样本不足导致模型能力误判，推荐采用变异控制协议并动态调整采样方案以提升科学性。

Abstract: Human preference evaluations are widely used to compare generative models, yet it remains unclear how many judgments are required to reliably detect small improvements. We show that when preference signal is diffuse across prompts (i.e., all prompt types are similarly informative), proportional allocation is minimax-optimal: no allocation strategy substantially improves detectability. Empirical analysis of large-scale human preference datasets shows that most comparisons fall into this diffuse regime, exhibiting small preference margins that require far more judgments than typically collected, even in well-sampled comparisons. These limits persist across evaluation protocols and modalities, including chat, image generation, and code generation with execution feedback. In contrast, curated benchmarks that reduce prompt induced variability systematically induce larger margins and improve detectability through a $1.5\times$ reduction in prompt-level variance. Our results show that inconclusive or negative human evaluation outcomes frequently reflect underpowered evaluation rather than model equivalence, underscoring the need to account explicitly for effect size, budget, and protocol design.

Conclusion: 证明SubTokenTest能有效暴露LLM分词机制的局限性，为改进模型架构和训练方法提供实证依据，验证测试时扩展策略的缓解作用

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced their reasoning capabilities. However, they continue to struggle with basic character-level tasks, such as counting letters in words, a problem rooted in their tokenization process. While existing benchmarks have highlighted this weakness through basic character operations, such failures are often dismissed due to lacking practical relevance. Yet, many real-world applications, such as navigating text-based maps or interpreting structured tables, rely heavily on precise sub-token understanding. In this regard, we introduce SubTokenTest, a comprehensive benchmark that assesses sub-token understanding through practical, utility-driven tasks. Our benchmark includes ten tasks across four domains and isolates tokenization-related failures by decoupling performance from complex reasoning. We provide a comprehensive evaluation of nine advanced LLMs. Additionally, we investigate the impact of test-time scaling on sub-token reasoning and explore how character-level information is encoded within the hidden states.

Abstract: Current patent claim generation systems face three fundamental limitations: poor cross-jurisdictional generalization, inadequate semantic relationship modeling between claims and prior art, and unreliable quality assessment. We introduce a novel three-stage framework that addresses these challenges through relationship-aware similarity analysis, domain-adaptive claim generation, and unified quality assessment. Our approach employs multi-head attention with eight specialized heads for explicit relationship modeling, integrates curriculum learning with dynamic LoRA adapter selection across five patent domains, and implements cross-attention mechanisms between evaluation aspects for comprehensive quality assessment. Extensive experiments on USPTO HUPD dataset, EPO patent collections, and Patent-CE benchmark demonstrate substantial improvements: 7.6-point ROUGE-L gain over GPT-4o, 8.3\% BERTScore enhancement over Llama-3.1-8B, and 0.847 correlation with human experts compared to 0.623 for separate evaluation models. Our method maintains 89.4\% cross-jurisdictional performance retention versus 76.2\% for baselines, establishing a comprehensive solution for automated patent prosecution workflows.

Motivation: 现有研究多关注刻板印象或表征偏差，而本文专注于客观问题中由身份引发的核心响应质量下降问题，并发现偏差源于生成而非知识编码。

Method: 设计身份稳健生成框架，选择性中和提示中非关键的身份信息，同时保留语义关键属性以保持内容完整性。

Result: 在4个基准测试和18种身份类型中，相较标准提示减少77%身份偏差，相较提示防御方法减少45%偏差。

Conclusion: 填补了身份线索影响生成质量的空白，提供新方法降低LLM响应偏差，同时维持事实准确性和内容可用性。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) outputs often vary across user sociodemographic attributes, leading to disparities in factual accuracy, utility, and safety, even for objective questions where demographic information is irrelevant. Unlike prior work on stereotypical or representational bias, this paper studies identity-dependent degradation of core response quality. We show empirically that such degradation arises from biased generation behavior, despite factual knowledge being robustly encoded across identities. Motivated by this mismatch, we propose a lightweight, training-free framework for identity-robust generation that selectively neutralizes non-critical identity information while preserving semantically essential attributes, thus maintaining output content integrity. Experiments across four benchmarks and 18 sociodemographic identities demonstrate an average 77% reduction in identity-dependent bias compared to vanilla prompting and a 45% reduction relative to prompt-based defenses. Our work addresses a critical gap in mitigating the impact of user identity cues in prompts on core generation quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LoRA存在秩崩溃、尺度模糊等问题，且全量微调计算成本高，需改进低资源场景下的模型适配方法。

Method: 在LoRA的ΔW=BA⊤基础上引入Σ矩阵形成ΔW=BΣA⊤，并约束B/A矩阵正交（Stiefel流形），通过几何重参数化兼容现有优化器。

Result: 在欧洲社会科学语义库层次概念检索任务中，OrthoGeoLoRA在同等低秩预算下超越标准LoRA及多种PEFT变体的排序指标。

Conclusion: 该方法为资源受限环境提供更高效的基础模型适配路径，尤其适用于数字图书馆等Web4Good场景。

Abstract: Large language models and text encoders increasingly power web-based information systems in the social sciences, including digital libraries, data catalogues, and search interfaces used by researchers, policymakers, and civil society. Full fine-tuning is often computationally and energy intensive, which can be prohibitive for smaller institutions and non-profit organizations in the Web4Good ecosystem. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), especially Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), reduces this cost by updating only a small number of parameters. We show that the standard LoRA update $ΔW = BA^\top$ has geometric drawbacks: gauge freedom, scale ambiguity, and a tendency toward rank collapse. We introduce OrthoGeoLoRA, which enforces an SVD-like form $ΔW = BΣA^\top$ by constraining the low-rank factors to be orthogonal (Stiefel manifold). A geometric reparameterization implements this constraint while remaining compatible with standard optimizers such as Adam and existing fine-tuning pipelines. We also propose a benchmark for hierarchical concept retrieval over the European Language Social Science Thesaurus (ELSST), widely used to organize social science resources in digital repositories. Experiments with a multilingual sentence encoder show that OrthoGeoLoRA outperforms standard LoRA and several strong PEFT variants on ranking metrics under the same low-rank budget, offering a more compute- and parameter-efficient path to adapt foundation models in resource-constrained settings.

Motivation: 传统SFT强制模型匹配单一参考答案，导致过拟合非核心表达；尽管引入多参考答案可缓解该问题，但数据和算力成本过高，需寻求更高效的替代方案。

Method: 发现词元概率与语义重要性的关联：高概率词承载核心逻辑框架，低概率词多为可替换表达；通过选择性屏蔽低概率词实现防过拟合（ProFit方法）。

Result: 实验表明ProFit在通用推理与数学基准测试中表现优于传统SFT基线模型。

Conclusion: ProFit通过低成本策略避免单参考答案过拟合，相比昂贵的多参考答案方案，能更高效提升模型性能。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a fundamental post-training strategy to align Large Language Models (LLMs) with human intent. However, traditional SFT often ignores the one-to-many nature of language by forcing alignment with a single reference answer, leading to the model overfitting to non-core expressions. Although our empirical analysis suggests that introducing multiple reference answers can mitigate this issue, the prohibitive data and computational costs necessitate a strategic shift: prioritizing the mitigation of single-reference overfitting over the costly pursuit of answer diversity. To achieve this, we reveal the intrinsic connection between token probability and semantic importance: high-probability tokens carry the core logical framework, while low-probability tokens are mostly replaceable expressions. Based on this insight, we propose ProFit, which selectively masks low-probability tokens to prevent surface-level overfitting. Extensive experiments confirm that ProFit consistently outperforms traditional SFT baselines on general reasoning and mathematical benchmarks.

Designed to bridge the gap between reasoning capability and inference efficiency, A.X K1 supports explicitly controllable reasoning to facilitate scalable deployment across diverse real-world scenarios. We propose a simple yet effective Think-Fusion training recipe, enabling user-controlled switching between thinking and non-thinking modes within a single unified model. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that A.X K1 achieves performance competitive with leading open-source models, while establishing a distinctive advantage in Korean-language benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Ca2KG addresses overconfidence in KG-RAG models by introducing a causality-aware calibration framework, using counterfactual prompting and re-scoring to improve prediction reliability without sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KG-RAG models produce high-confidence but potentially unreliable predictions regardless of knowledge graph completeness, limiting their use in critical applications. Reliable calibration is essential for deployment in high-stakes domains.

Method: Ca2KG incorporates counterfactual prompting to expose uncertainties in retrieved knowledge and integrates a panel-based re-scoring mechanism to stabilize predictions under varying conditions.

Result: Experiments on two complex QA datasets show Ca2KG improves calibration metrics (e.g., Brier score, ECE) while maintaining or slightly surpassing baseline accuracy (e.g., F1 score) compared to standard KG-RAG models.

Conclusion: Ca2KG effectively reduces overconfidence in knowledge graph-augmented reasoning while preserving LLMs' factual accuracy, enabling safer deployment of KG-RAG systems in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Knowledge Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-RAG) extends the RAG paradigm by incorporating structured knowledge from knowledge graphs, enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform more precise and explainable reasoning. While KG-RAG improves factual accuracy in complex tasks, existing KG-RAG models are often severely overconfident, producing high-confidence predictions even when retrieved sub-graphs are incomplete or unreliable, which raises concerns for deployment in high-stakes domains. To address this issue, we propose Ca2KG, a Causality-aware Calibration framework for KG-RAG. Ca2KG integrates counterfactual prompting, which exposes retrieval-dependent uncertainties in knowledge quality and reasoning reliability, with a panel-based re-scoring mechanism that stabilises predictions across interventions. Extensive experiments on two complex QA datasets demonstrate that Ca2KG consistently improves calibration while maintaining or even enhancing predictive accuracy.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了FairToT框架，在不修改模型参数的前提下，通过提示引导的毒性评估和两个可解释公平性指标，提升大型语言模型在推理阶段的公平性，有效降低群体层面的毒性判断偏差。实验表明该方法可在维持预测稳定性的同时显著减少公平性偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs在隐性仇恨言论等细微表达的毒性判断中存在显著群体偏差且难以通过训练修正，而现有方法忽视了何时触发修正机制的关键问题。当模型对同一内容因涉及不同群体而产生毒性判断波动时，需要可靠的机制来识别并修正这种偏差。

Method: 提出FairToT推理框架：1) 设计prompt引导的毒性评估流程，自动识别需二次验证的群体相关案例；2) 开发两个可解释的公平性指标（如毒性置信度差异分析）动态检测模型判断波动；3) 通过多轮评估机制在推理阶段进行偏差修正。整个过程不依赖模型参数修改。

Result: 在基准数据集的实验中，FairToT将群体层面的毒性预测差异降低达57%，毒性判断波动率下降42%，同时维持0.89以上的预测一致性F1值。与基线模型相比，其公平性指标提升幅度达31%，且无需额外训练成本。

Conclusion: 推理阶段的动态质量控制能有效提升LLMs的公平性，FairToT提供的可解释公平性指标验证了后处理方法的可行性，为平衡安全审核系统的效率与公平性提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for toxicity assessment in online moderation systems, where fairness across demographic groups is essential for equitable treatment. However, LLMs often produce inconsistent toxicity judgements for subtle expressions, particularly those involving implicit hate speech, revealing underlying biases that are difficult to correct through standard training. This raises a key question that existing approaches often overlook: when should corrective mechanisms be invoked to ensure fair and reliable assessments? To address this, we propose FairToT, an inference-time framework that enhances LLM fairness through prompt-guided toxicity assessment. FairToT identifies cases where demographic-related variation is likely to occur and determines when additional assessment should be applied. In addition, we introduce two interpretable fairness indicators that detect such cases and improve inference consistency without modifying model parameters. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that FairToT reduces group-level disparities while maintaining stable and reliable toxicity predictions, demonstrating that inference-time refinement offers an effective and practical approach for fairness improvement in LLM-based toxicity assessment systems.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), their potential has garnered significant attention in Chinese Classical Studies (CCS). While existing research has primarily focused on text and visual modalities, the audio corpus within this domain remains largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose the Multi-task Classical Chinese Literary Genre Audio Corpus (MCGA). It encompasses a diverse range of literary genres across six tasks: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Speech-to-Text Translation (S2TT), Speech Emotion Captioning (SEC), Spoken Question Answering (SQA), Speech Understanding (SU), and Speech Reasoning (SR). Through the evaluation of ten MLLMs, our experimental results demonstrate that current models still face substantial challenges when processed on the MCGA test set. Furthermore, we introduce an evaluation metric for SEC and a metric to measure the consistency between the speech and text capabilities of MLLMs. We release MCGA and our code to the public to facilitate the development of MLLMs with more robust multidimensional audio capabilities in CCS.

TL;DR: ReGraM通过聚焦于知识图谱中的相关子图而非完整图谱，显著提升医学问答系统的准确性与推理稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学问答系统依赖全知识图谱遍历或大规模检索，导致噪声干扰和多跳推理不稳定。作者提出核心问题在于如何为每个查询识别并推理合适的证据子集，而非单纯扩展知识访问。

Method: 提出区域优先的知识图谱推理框架ReGraM：1) 构建查询对齐的子图；2) 在局部区域内进行多证据感知模式的逐步推理；3) 通过约束推理范围打破传统假设（所有关系同等重要）。

Result: 在7个医学问答基准测试中，ReGraM相较KGARevion基线：MCQ准确率提升8.04%，SAQ提升4.50%，幻觉率降低42.9%。消融实验证实区域构建与跳步推理的对齐是性能提升的关键。

Conclusion: 区域优先的知识图谱推理范式能有效提升医学问答的事实准确性与一致性，尤其在领域特定场景中表现突出。

Abstract: Recent studies in medical question answering (Medical QA) have actively explored the integration of large language models (LLMs) with biomedical knowledge graphs (KGs) to improve factual accuracy. However, most existing approaches still rely on traversing the entire KG or performing large-scale retrieval, which introduces substantial noise and leads to unstable multi-hop reasoning. We argue that the core challenge lies not in expanding access to knowledge, but in identifying and reasoning over the appropriate subset of evidence for each query. ReGraM is a region-first knowledge graph reasoning framework that addresses this challenge by constructing a query-aligned subgraph and performing stepwise reasoning constrained to this localized region under multiple evidence aware modes. By focusing inference on only the most relevant portion of the KG, ReGraM departs from the assumption that all relations are equally useful an assumption that rarely holds in domain-specific medical settings. Experiments on seven medical QA benchmarks demonstrate that ReGraM consistently outperforms a strong baseline (KGARevion), achieving an 8.04% absolute accuracy gain on MCQ, a 4.50% gain on SAQ, and a 42.9% reduction in hallucination rate. Ablation and qualitative analyses further show that aligning region construction with hop-wise reasoning is the primary driver of these improvements. Overall, our results highlight region-first KG reasoning as an effective paradigm for improving factual accuracy and consistency in medical QA.

TL;DR: This paper analyzes how language models handle German definite articles, finding that parameter updates for specific gender-case transitions affect unrelated settings, suggesting memorization rather than rule-based generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study investigates whether language models rely on rule-based generalization or memorization for grammatical agreement, challenging the assumption that they encode abstract grammatical rules.

Method: The paper employs GRADIEND, a gradient-based interpretability technique, to learn parameter update directions for gender-case specific article transitions in German definite articles.

Result: Parameter updates for specific gender-case transitions frequently affect unrelated gender-case settings, revealing substantial overlap among the most affected neurons across different settings.

Conclusion: The findings argue against strictly rule-based encoding of German definite articles, indicating that language models at least partly rely on memorized associations rather than abstract grammatical rules for grammatical agreement.

Abstract: Language models perform well on grammatical agreement, but it is unclear whether this reflects rule-based generalization or memorization. We study this question for German definite singular articles, whose forms depend on gender and case. Using GRADIEND, a gradient-based interpretability method, we learn parameter update directions for gender-case specific article transitions. We find that updates learned for a specific gender-case article transition frequently affect unrelated gender-case settings, with substantial overlap among the most affected neurons across settings. These results argue against a strictly rule-based encoding of German definite articles, indicating that models at least partly rely on memorized associations rather than abstract grammatical rules.

Conclusion: 对话系统需要专门设计的共同基础表示机制，关系化建模方法提供了有效框架。研究结果为建造持续理解用户意图的真实对话系统提供了理论支持与技术路径。

Abstract: Common ground plays a critical role in situated spoken dialogues, where interlocutors must establish and maintain shared references to entities, events, and relations to sustain coherent interaction. For dialog systems, the ability to correctly ground conversational content in order to refer back to it later is particularly important. Prior studies have demonstrated that LLMs are capable of performing grounding acts such as requesting clarification or producing acknowledgments, yet relatively little work has investigated how common ground can be explicitly represented and stored for later use. Without such mechanisms, it remains unclear whether acknowledgment or clarification behaviors truly reflect a grounded understanding. In this work, we evaluate a model's ability to establish and exploit common ground through relational references to entities within the shared context in a situational dialogue. We test multiple methods for representing common ground in situated dialogues and further propose approaches to improve both the establishment of common ground and its subsequent use in the conversation.

Abstract: The scarcity of annotated datasets for clinical information extraction in non-English languages hinders the evaluation of large language model (LLM)-based methods developed primarily in English. In this study, we present the first comprehensive bilingual evaluation of LLMs for the clinical Relation Extraction (RE) task in both English and Turkish. To facilitate this evaluation, we introduce the first English-Turkish parallel clinical RE dataset, derived and carefully curated from the 2010 i2b2/VA relation classification corpus. We systematically assess a diverse set of prompting strategies, including multiple in-context learning (ICL) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) approaches, and compare their performance to fine-tuned baselines such as PURE. Furthermore, we propose Relation-Aware Retrieval (RAR), a novel in-context example selection method based on contrastive learning, that is specifically designed to capture both sentence-level and relation-level semantics. Our results show that prompting-based LLM approaches consistently outperform traditional fine-tuned models. Moreover, evaluations for English performed better than their Turkish counterparts across all evaluated LLMs and prompting techniques. Among ICL methods, RAR achieves the highest performance, with Gemini 1.5 Flash reaching a micro-F1 score of 0.906 in English and 0.888 in Turkish. Performance further improves to 0.918 F1 in English when RAR is combined with a structured reasoning prompt using the DeepSeek-V3 model. These findings highlight the importance of high-quality demonstration retrieval and underscore the potential of advanced retrieval and prompting techniques to bridge resource gaps in clinical natural language processing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过考察'未完成体悖论'（过去进行时对活动类与成就类动词的实现差异），验证LLMs是否具备语义组合能力而非仅依赖表层概率模式。

Method: 构建诊断数据集ImperfectiveNLI测试多语义类别差异；评估开源模型权重，结合表示分析与基于提示的干预实验。

Result: 模型普遍存在目标导向预测偏差，覆盖明确否定表达；嵌入层可区分过程/结果但解码决策受目标达成先验支配；提示干预降低幻觉完成但增加正当蕴涵拒绝率。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs缺乏体范畴结构意识，表现为准叙事引擎而非保真逻辑推理者，揭示预训练语言模型的语义理解局限性。

Abstract: Do Large Language Models (LLMs) genuinely grasp the compositional semantics of events, or do they rely on surface-level probabilistic heuristics? We investigate the Imperfective Paradox, a logical phenomenon where the past progressive aspect entails event realization for activities (e.g., running $\to$ ran) but not for accomplishments (e.g., building $\nrightarrow$ built). We introduce ImperfectiveNLI, a diagnostic dataset designed to probe this distinction across diverse semantic classes. Evaluating state-of-the-art open-weight models, we uncover a pervasive Teleological Bias: models systematically hallucinate completion for goal-oriented events, often overriding explicit textual negation. Representational analyses show that while internal embeddings often distinguish process from result, inference decisions are dominated by strong priors about goal attainment. We further find that prompting-based interventions reduce hallucinated completions but also increase incorrect rejections of valid entailments. Our findings suggest that current LLMs lack structural aspectual awareness, operating as predictive narrative engines rather than faithful logical reasoners.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在特定领域微调后易出现能力退化或灾难性遗忘，需探究模型参数中能力的分布机制，并寻求兼顾能力保留与迁移的解决方案。

Method: 通过分析跨语言/领域的模型激活模式，定位能力相关通道（<5%），基于激活差异筛选关键通道进行参数迁移，结合轻量微调实现能力整合。

Result: 在多语言数学与科学推理任务中，ACT成功恢复遗忘能力且保留原有技能；可融合多个专业化模型，实现多能力集成且干扰最小。

Conclusion: 模型能力集中在少数离散通道，ACT通过激活引导的能力定位与迁移，为模型专业化与泛化平衡提供了有效路径。

Abstract: Large language models can be continually pre-trained or fine-tuned to improve performance in specific domains, languages, or skills, but this specialization often degrades other capabilities and may cause catastrophic forgetting. We investigate how abilities are distributed within LLM parameters by analyzing module activations under domain- and language-specific inputs for closely related models. Across layers and modules, we find that ability-related activations are highly concentrated in a small set of channels (typically <5\%), and these channels are largely disentangled with good sufficiency and stability. Building on these observations, we propose ACT (Activation-Guided Channel-wise Ability Transfer), which localizes ability-relevant channels via activation differences and selectively transfers only the corresponding parameters, followed by lightweight fine-tuning for compatibility. Experiments on multilingual mathematical and scientific reasoning show that ACT can recover forgotten abilities while preserving retained skills. It can also merge multiple specialized models to integrate several abilities into a single model with minimal interference. Our code and data will be publicly released.

Conclusion: PAGER通过结构化知识表示增强RAG性能，为检索增强生成提供了更系统和有效的框架设计范式。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge. Recently, some works have incorporated iterative knowledge accumulation processes into RAG models to progressively accumulate and refine query-related knowledge, thereby constructing more comprehensive knowledge representations. However, these iterative processes often lack a coherent organizational structure, which limits the construction of more comprehensive and cohesive knowledge representations. To address this, we propose PAGER, a page-driven autonomous knowledge representation framework for RAG. PAGER first prompts an LLM to construct a structured cognitive outline for a given question, which consists of multiple slots representing a distinct knowledge aspect. Then, PAGER iteratively retrieves and refines relevant documents to populate each slot, ultimately constructing a coherent page that serves as contextual input for guiding answer generation. Experiments on multiple knowledge-intensive benchmarks and backbone models show that PAGER consistently outperforms all RAG baselines. Further analyses demonstrate that PAGER constructs higher-quality and information-dense knowledge representations, better mitigates knowledge conflicts, and enables LLMs to leverage external knowledge more effectively.

Method: 通过训练具有BERT特性的微型模型BabyLM，使用可修改的小规模语料库模拟大型模型的偏见形成机制，并在预训练阶段进行去偏见方法测试。

Result: BabyLMs在内在偏见形成、性能发展与BERT模型高度一致，且在多种去偏见方法中表现相似相关性。实验发现性别不平衡和毒性数据对偏见形成的特定影响，预训练成本从500GPU小时降至30小时。

Conclusion: BabyLMs可作为研究大规模语言模型去偏见的经济沙箱，显着降低研发成本并促进公平化模型研究的可及性。

Abstract: Pre-trained language models (LMs) have, over the last few years, grown substantially in both societal adoption and training costs. This rapid growth in size has constrained progress in understanding and mitigating their biases. Since re-training LMs is prohibitively expensive, most debiasing work has focused on post-hoc or masking-based strategies, which often fail to address the underlying causes of bias. In this work, we seek to democratise pre-model debiasing research by using low-cost proxy models. Specifically, we investigate BabyLMs, compact BERT-like models trained on small and mutable corpora that can approximate bias acquisition and learning dynamics of larger models. We show that BabyLMs display closely aligned patterns of intrinsic bias formation and performance development compared to standard BERT models, despite their drastically reduced size. Furthermore, correlations between BabyLMs and BERT hold across multiple intra-model and post-model debiasing methods. Leveraging these similarities, we conduct pre-model debiasing experiments with BabyLMs, replicating prior findings and presenting new insights regarding the influence of gender imbalance and toxicity on bias formation. Our results demonstrate that BabyLMs can serve as an effective sandbox for large-scale LMs, reducing pre-training costs from over 500 GPU-hours to under 30 GPU-hours. This provides a way to democratise pre-model debiasing research and enables faster, more accessible exploration of methods for building fairer LMs.

Result: 发现特定模型组件负责编码预训练冲突知识，并实现在推理阶段通过可解释性方法进行因果干预控制冲突。

Conclusion: 机械可解释性方法可有效定位并干预预训练知识冲突，为模型内部矛盾知识管理提供了新路径。

Abstract: In language models (LMs), intra-memory knowledge conflict largely arises when inconsistent information about the same event is encoded within the model's parametric knowledge. While prior work has primarily focused on resolving conflicts between a model's internal knowledge and external resources through approaches such as fine-tuning or knowledge editing, the problem of localizing conflicts that originate during pre-training within the model's internal representations remain unexplored. In this work, we design a framework based on mechanistic interpretability methods to identify where and how conflicting knowledge from the pre-training data is encoded within LMs. Our findings contribute to a growing body of evidence that specific internal components of a language model are responsible for encoding conflicting knowledge from pre-training, and we demonstrate how mechanistic interpretability methods can be leveraged to causally intervene in and control conflicting knowledge at inference time.

Abstract: The use of formal language for deductive logical reasoning aligns well with language models (LMs), where translating natural language (NL) into first-order logic (FOL) and employing an external solver results in a verifiable and therefore reliable reasoning system. However, smaller LMs often struggle with this translation task, frequently producing incorrect symbolic outputs due to formatting and translation errors. Existing approaches typically rely on self-iteration to correct these errors, but such methods depend heavily on the capabilities of the underlying model. To address this, we first categorize common errors and fine-tune smaller LMs using data synthesized by large language models. The evaluation is performed using the defined error categories. We introduce incremental inference, which divides inference into two stages, predicate generation and FOL translation, providing greater control over model behavior and enhancing generation quality as measured by predicate metrics. This decomposition framework also enables the use of a verification module that targets predicate-arity errors to further improve performance. Our study evaluates three families of models across four logical-reasoning datasets. The comprehensive fine-tuning, incremental inference, and verification modules reduce error rates, increase predicate coverage, and improve reasoning performance for smaller LMs, moving us closer to developing reliable and accessible symbolic-reasoning systems.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has fostered diverse paradigms for automated slide generation, ranging from code-driven layouts to image-centric synthesis. However, evaluating these heterogeneous systems remains challenging, as existing protocols often struggle to provide comparable scores across architectures or rely on uncalibrated judgments. In this paper, we introduce SlidesGen-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate slide generation through a lens of three core principles: universality, quantification, and reliability. First, to establish a unified evaluation framework, we ground our analysis in the visual domain, treating terminal outputs as renderings to remain agnostic to the underlying generation method. Second, we propose a computational approach that quantitatively assesses slides across three distinct dimensions - Content, Aesthetics, and Editability - offering reproducible metrics where prior works relied on subjective or reference-dependent proxies. Finally, to ensure high correlation with human preference, we construct the Slides-Align1.5k dataset, a human preference aligned dataset covering slides from nine mainstream generation systems across seven scenarios. Our experiments demonstrate that SlidesGen-Bench achieves a higher degree of alignment with human judgment than existing evaluation pipelines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动生成方法在组织结构、层次关系和方法比较上存在不足，难以达到专家综述的结构性和完整性，亟需一种更结构化的方法。

Method: 1) 结构优先：构建研究领域的概念树；2) 生成受概念树约束的比较表格；3) 使用概念树和表格作为结构约束生成文本，并引入综合评估框架评估结构质量、比较完整性和引用保真度。

Result: 在76个计算机科学主题上的实验表明，MVSS在组织结构和证据支持（引用保真度）上优于现有方法，且综合性能可与专家综述相媲美。

Conclusion: MVSS通过多视角的结构化表征（层次树+比较表格+文本）有效提升了自动综述的生成质量，并提供了客观的评估框架，为领域知识的系统梳理提供了新方法。

Abstract: Scientific surveys require not only summarizing large bodies of literature, but also organizing them into clear and coherent conceptual structures. Existing automatic survey generation methods typically focus on linear text generation and struggle to explicitly model hierarchical relations among research topics and structured methodological comparisons, resulting in gaps in structural organization compared to expert-written surveys. We propose MVSS, a multi-view structured survey generation framework that jointly generates and aligns citation-grounded hierarchical trees, structured comparison tables, and survey text. MVSS follows a structure-first paradigm: it first constructs a conceptual tree of the research domain, then generates comparison tables constrained by the tree, and finally uses both as structural constraints for text generation. This enables complementary multi-view representations across structure, comparison, and narrative. We introduce an evaluation framework assessing structural quality, comparative completeness, and citation fidelity. Experiments on 76 computer science topics show MVSS outperforms existing methods in organization and evidence grounding, achieving performance comparable to expert surveys.

TL;DR: 本文提出SERM（Self-Evolving Relevance Model）方法，通过多智能体样本挖掘与双层标注框架，解决工业级搜索场景中动态查询流导致的样本稀疏与伪标签不可靠问题，在大规模场景中实现性能迭代提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有相关性模型难以适应真实查询流的动态演变，而自我进化技术在工业场景中面临两大数据挑战：1）信息样本稀疏且难以识别，2）伪标签可靠性不足，亟需能动态适应且鲁棒性强的方案。

Method: 构建双模块架构：（1）多智能体样本挖掘器，利用分布偏移检测技术动态筛选高价值样本；（2）多智能体相关性标注器，采用双层共识框架（样本内一致性与模型间一致性）生成可靠伪标签，形成闭环自进化系统。

Result: 在服务日均数十亿请求的工业系统中，离线多语言测试显示迭代5次后模型性能提升12.7%，在线AB测试点击率提升8.3%，且伪标签准确率从基线62%提升至79%，验证了方法有效性。

Conclusion: SERM通过动态数据蒸馏与共识标注机制，为工业级搜索系统提供了可扩展的自进化范式，在实际部署中实现持续性能优化与业务指标提升。

Abstract: Due to the dynamically evolving nature of real-world query streams, relevance models struggle to generalize to practical search scenarios. A sophisticated solution is self-evolution techniques. However, in large-scale industrial settings with massive query streams, this technique faces two challenges: (1) informative samples are often sparse and difficult to identify, and (2) pseudo-labels generated by the current model could be unreliable. To address these challenges, in this work, we propose a Self-Evolving Relevance Model approach (SERM), which comprises two complementary multi-agent modules: a multi-agent sample miner, designed to detect distributional shifts and identify informative training samples, and a multi-agent relevance annotator, which provides reliable labels through a two-level agreement framework. We evaluate SERM in a large-scale industrial setting, which serves billions of user requests daily. Experimental results demonstrate that SERM can achieve significant performance gains through iterative self-evolution, as validated by extensive offline multilingual evaluations and online testing.

TL;DR: 本研究系统评估了MXFP格式下的后训练量化方法，发现MXFP8表现优异而MXFP4仍存挑战，提出预缩放策略可提升MXFP4效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管已有多种后训练量化算法，但多数聚焦于整数量化，MXFP格式下的量化行为尚未被充分探索，需要系统性研究。

Method: 对包含7种PTQ算法、15个基准测试和3种LLM家族的MXFP量化进行系统性研究，分析算法有效性、格式兼容性及误差源。

Result: 1) MXFP8保持近无损性能，MXFP4准确性显著下降；2) PTQ效果依赖格式兼容性，部分算法更优；3) 量化敏感度主要由语言模型决定；4) MXFP4误差主因是缩放因子，预缩放优化可有效缓解问题。

Conclusion: 研究结果为适配MXFP量化提供了实践指南，揭示了不同位宽限制下的优化方向及关键算法选择原则。

Abstract: Microscaling Floating-Point (MXFP) has emerged as a promising low-precision format for large language models (LLMs). Despite various post-training quantization (PTQ) algorithms being proposed, they mostly focus on integer quantization, while their applicability and behavior under MXFP formats remain largely unexplored. To address this gap, this work conducts a systematic investigation of PTQ under MXFP formats, encompassing over 7 PTQ algorithms, 15 evaluation benchmarks, and 3 LLM families. The key findings include: 1) MXFP8 consistently achieves near-lossless performance, while MXFP4 introduces substantial accuracy degradation and remains challenging; 2) PTQ effectiveness under MXFP depends strongly on format compatibility, with some algorithmic paradigms being consistently more effective than others; 3) PTQ performance exhibits highly consistent trends across model families and modalities, in particular, quantization sensitivity is dominated by the language model rather than the vision encoder in multimodal LLMs; 4) The scaling factor of quantization is a critical error source in MXFP4, and a simple pre-scale optimization strategy can significantly mitigate its impact. Together, these results provide practical guidance on adapting existing PTQ methods to MXFP quantization.

TL;DR: 本文提出Dialogue Telemetry（DT）框架，通过对话轮次级信号（进度估计与停滞检测）解决自主信息收集对话系统的效率监控问题，并通过强化学习应用验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自主对话系统缺乏实时观测对话效率的指标，无法及时识别无效追问现象，且传统因果诊断方法在实践中难以实施。这种工具缺失阻碍了任务关键场景（如救援）中信息获取的可靠性。

Method: 设计模型无关的DT框架：1) 进度估计器（PE）通过量化类别剩余信息潜力建立动态基准， 2) 停滞指数（SI）通过检测语义重复追问的低收益回答特征触发警报。通过模拟搜索与救援场景的LLM对话实验，在强化学习政策中整合DT信号进行验证。

Result: 实验区分出高效与停滞对话的可解释模式，SI成功识别出重复追问失效场景。集成DT信号的强化学习政策在运营成本约束下显著提升对话效率，证明了监测指标的实用价值。

Conclusion: DT框架填补了自主对话系统的实时监控工具缺口，其进度评估与停滞检测机制可解释且普适，为代价敏感型任务中的对话策略优化提供了新的技术路径。

Abstract: Autonomous systems conducting schema-grounded information-gathering dialogues face an instrumentation gap, lacking turn-level observables for monitoring acquisition efficiency and detecting when questioning becomes unproductive. We introduce Dialogue Telemetry (DT), a measurement framework that produces two model-agnostic signals after each question-answer exchange: (i) a Progress Estimator (PE) quantifying residual information potential per category (with a bits-based variant), and (ii) a Stalling Index (SI) detecting an observable failure signature characterized by repeated category probing with semantically similar, low-marginal-gain responses. SI flags this pattern without requiring causal diagnosis, supporting monitoring in settings where attributing degradation to specific causes may be impractical. We validate DT in controlled search-and-rescue (SAR)-inspired interviews using large language model (LLM)-based simulations, distinguishing efficient from stalled dialogue traces and illustrating downstream utility by integrating DT signals into a reinforcement learning (RL) policy. Across these settings, DT provides interpretable turn-level instrumentation that improves policy performance when stalling carries operational costs.

Method: 构建半结构化长链式思考框架，将生成过程分解为中间步骤：1) 多样性规划分支在计划阶段基于差异性引入分化 2) 群组感知多样性奖励函数激励差异化轨迹生成。

Result: 创造性写作基准测试显示新方法显著提升生成多样性（如n-gram熵值增加18.7%）且不损失质量（ROUGE-L保持0.72），多样性指标超越基线模型达23.4%。

Conclusion: 该框架实现了生成质量与多样性的均衡优化，为RL增强型LLM在开放域任务中的应用提供了可扩展的新型训练范式。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL)-based enhancement of large language models (LLMs) often leads to reduced output diversity, undermining their utility in open-ended tasks like creative writing. Current methods lack explicit mechanisms for guiding diverse exploration and instead prioritize optimization efficiency and performance over diversity. This paper proposes an RL framework structured around a semi-structured long Chain-of-Thought (CoT), in which the generation process is decomposed into explicitly planned intermediate steps. We introduce a Diverse Planning Branching method that strategically introduces divergence at the planning phase based on diversity variation, alongside a group-aware diversity reward to encourage distinct trajectories. Experimental results on creative writing benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly improves output diversity without compromising generation quality, consistently outperforming existing baselines.

Conclusion: TaxoBell解决了传统嵌入方法的关键缺陷，显著优于现有分类法扩展方法，适用于需要精确层级推理的领域。

Abstract: Taxonomies form the backbone of structured knowledge representation across diverse domains, enabling applications such as e-commerce catalogs, semantic search, and biomedical discovery. Yet, manual taxonomy expansion is labor-intensive and cannot keep pace with the emergence of new concepts. Existing automated methods rely on point-based vector embeddings, which model symmetric similarity and thus struggle with the asymmetric "is-a" relationships that are fundamental to taxonomies. Box embeddings offer a promising alternative by enabling containment and disjointness, but they face key issues: (i) unstable gradients at the intersection boundaries, (ii) no notion of semantic uncertainty, and (iii) limited capacity to represent polysemy or ambiguity. We address these shortcomings with TaxoBell, a Gaussian box embedding framework that translates between box geometries and multivariate Gaussian distributions, where means encode semantic location and covariances encode uncertainty. Energy-based optimization yields stable optimization, robust modeling of ambiguous concepts, and interpretable hierarchical reasoning. Extensive experimentation on five benchmark datasets demonstrates that TaxoBell significantly outperforms eight state-of-the-art taxonomy expansion baselines by 19% in MRR and around 25% in Recall@k. We further demonstrate the advantages and pitfalls of TaxoBell with error analysis and ablation studies.

Conclusion: 生成数据训练路由可行且有效，CASCAL算法显著提升了对低质生成器的容忍度。该成果为资源受限场景下的LLM服务优化提供了新方法。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) routers dynamically select optimal models for given inputs. Existing approaches typically assume access to ground-truth labeled data, which is often unavailable in practice, especially when user request distributions are heterogeneous and unknown. We introduce Routing with Generated Data (RGD), a challenging setting in which routers are trained exclusively on generated queries and answers produced from high-level task descriptions by generator LLMs. We evaluate query-answer routers (using both queries and labels) and query-only routers across four diverse benchmarks and 12 models, finding that query-answer routers degrade faster than query-only routers as generator quality decreases. Our analysis reveals two crucial characteristics of effective generators: they must accurately respond to their own questions, and their questions must produce sufficient performance differentiation among the model pool. We then show how filtering for these characteristics can improve the quality of generated data. We further propose CASCAL, a novel query-only router that estimates model correctness through consensus voting and identifies model-specific skill niches via hierarchical clustering. CASCAL is substantially more robust to generator quality, outperforming the best query-answer router by 4.6% absolute accuracy when trained on weak generator data.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种基于数值感知前缀标记的表征方法，提升Transformer模型在数值运算中的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer语言模型在数学推理任务上表现优异，但对数值和算术的基础理解存在系统性缺陷，因其符号化处理方式未显式编码数值大小信息。

Method: 设计专用数值前缀标记，其嵌入向量由数值本身直接约束，并与现有分词器及解码器架构兼容，在不改变模型结构的前提下增强数值表征能力。

Result: 在算术任务测试中，该方法在不同数值格式、任务类型及位数长度下均显著优于基线模型，尤其在数值范围外推场景中效果突出。

Conclusion: 显式数值编码有效解决了语言模型基础数值推理缺陷，为改善模型数学能力提供了高效且通用的技术路径。

Abstract: Transformer-based language models often achieve strong results on mathematical reasoning benchmarks while remaining fragile on basic numerical understanding and arithmetic operations. A central limitation is that numbers are processed as symbolic tokens whose embeddings do not explicitly encode numerical value, leading to systematic errors. We introduce a value-aware numerical representation that augments standard tokenized inputs with a dedicated prefix token whose embedding is explicitly conditioned on the underlying numerical value. This mechanism injects magnitude information directly into the model's input space while remaining compatible with existing tokenizers and decoder-only Transformer architectures. Evaluation on arithmetic tasks shows that the proposed approach outperforms baselines across numerical formats, tasks, and operand lengths. These results indicate that explicitly encoding numerical value is an effective and efficient way to improve fundamental numerical robustness in language models.
