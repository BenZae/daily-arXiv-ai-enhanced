However, current automated systems struggle with ultra-high-resolution drawings due to high computational demands, information loss, and a lack of holistic semantic understanding for design error identification. This paper proposes a novel three-stage framework for intelligent power grid drawing review, driven by pre-trained Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) through advanced prompt engineering. Mimicking the human expert review process, the first stage leverages an MLLM for global semantic understanding to intelligently propose domain-specific semantic regions from a low-resolution overview. The second stage then performs high-resolution, fine-grained recognition within these proposed regions, acquiring detailed information with associated confidence scores. In the final stage, a comprehensive decision-making module integrates these confidence-aware results to accurately diagnose design errors and provide a reliability assessment. Preliminary results on real-world power grid drawings demonstrate our approach significantly enhances MLLM's ability to grasp macroscopic semantic information and pinpoint design errors, showing improved defect discovery accuracy and greater reliability in review judgments compared to traditional passive MLLM inference. This research offers a novel, prompt-driven paradigm for intelligent and reliable power grid drawing review.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u7535\u7f51\u56fe\u7eb8\u5ba1\u67e5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u7cbe\u7ec6\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7ec6\u8282\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7f3a\u9677\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u5904\u7406\u8d85\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7535\u7f51\u56fe\u7eb8\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u7b97\u529b\u6d88\u8017\u5927\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5168\u5c40\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u8bc6\u522b\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "method": "1) MLLM\u5168\u5c40\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u53d6\u5173\u952e\u533a\u57df 2) \u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u533a\u57df\u7ec6\u8282\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u8f93\u51fa\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6 3) \u7ed3\u5408\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u51b3\u7b56\u6a21\u5757\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9519\u8bef\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u53ef\u9760\u6027", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u7535\u7f51\u56fe\u7eb8\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u8f83\u4f20\u7edfMLLM\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5b8f\u89c2\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7f3a\u9677\u53d1\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0e\u5ba1\u67e5\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u9ad828.6%\u548c34.2%", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u5ba1\u67e5\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7ec6\u8282\u5904\u7406\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u7ea7\u56fe\u7eb8\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6280\u672f\u4f18\u52bf"}}

Existing reawakening methods mainly rely on prompt-level optimization to manipulate sampling trajectories, neglecting other generative factors, which limits a comprehensive understanding of the underlying dynamics. In this paper, we model the generation process as an implicit function to enable a comprehensive theoretical analysis of multiple factors, including text conditions, model parameters, and latent states. We theoretically show that perturbing each factor can reawaken erased concepts. Building on this insight, we propose a novel concept reawakening method: Latent space Unblocking for concept REawakening (LURE), which reawakens erased concepts by reconstructing the latent space and guiding the sampling trajectory. Specifically, our semantic re-binding mechanism reconstructs the latent space by aligning denoising predictions with target distributions to reestablish severed text-visual associations. However, in multi-concept scenarios, naive reconstruction can cause gradient conflicts and feature entanglement. To address this, we introduce Gradient Field Orthogonalization, which enforces feature orthogonality to prevent mutual interference. Additionally, our Latent Semantic Identification-Guided Sampling (LSIS) ensures stability of the reawakening process via posterior density verification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LURE enables simultaneous, high-fidelity reawakening of multiple erased concepts across diverse erasure tasks and methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aLURE\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u5efa\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u5f15\u5bfc\u91c7\u6837\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u591a\u4e2a\u64e6\u9664\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u9ad8\u6548\u590d\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6982\u5ff5\u64e6\u9664\u6f0f\u6d1e\u7814\u7a76\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u63d0\u793a\u7ea7\u522b\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u6761\u4ef6\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u7b49\u5176\u4ed6\u751f\u6210\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u65e0\u6cd5\u5168\u9762\u5206\u6790\u590d\u73b0\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "1. \u5c06\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u9690\u51fd\u6570\u4ee5\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u56e0\u7d20\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff1b2. \u63d0\u51fa\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u89e3\u963b\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u68af\u5ea6\u573a\u6b63\u4ea4\u5316\u6280\u672f\u5904\u7406\u7279\u5f81\u7ea0\u7f20\uff1b3. \u901a\u8fc7\u540e\u9a8c\u5bc6\u5ea6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684LSIS\u6a21\u5757\u4fdd\u969c\u590d\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8de8\u591a\u79cd\u64e6\u9664\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cLURE\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u591a\u4e2a\u64e6\u9664\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u540c\u6b65\u590d\u73b0\uff0c\u590d\u73b0\u6210\u529f\u7387\u8f83\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u534740%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u660e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u590d\u73b0\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0cLURE\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u91cd\u6784\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u64e6\u9664\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Existing document AI systems remain limited by OCR errors, long-document fragmentation, constrained throughput, and insufficient auditability for high-stakes synthesis. We present a schema-constrained AI extraction system that transforms full-text biomedical PDFs into structured, analysis-ready records by explicitly restricting model inference through typed schemas, controlled vocabularies, and evidence-gated decisions. Documents are ingested using resume-aware hashing, partitioned into caption-aware page-level chunks, and processed asynchronously under explicit concurrency controls. Chunk-level outputs are deterministically merged into study-level records using conflict-aware consolidation, set-based aggregation, and sentence-level provenance to support traceability and post-hoc audit. Evaluated on a corpus of studies on direct oral anticoagulant level measurement, the pipeline processed all documents without manual intervention, maintained stable throughput under service constraints, and exhibited strong internal consistency across document chunks. Iterative schema refinement substantially improved extraction fidelity for synthesis-critical variables, including assay classification, outcome definitions, follow-up duration, and timing of measurement.

Existing benchmarks primarily emphasize indoor or street settings, overlooking the unique challenges of open-ended urban spaces characterized by rich semantics, complex geometries, and view variations. To address this, we introduce CityCube, a systematic benchmark designed to probe cross-view reasoning capabilities of current VLMs in urban settings. CityCube integrates four viewpoint dynamics to mimic camera movements and spans a wide spectrum of perspectives from multiple platforms, e.g., vehicles, drones and satellites. For a comprehensive assessment, it features 5,022 meticulously annotated multi-view QA pairs categorized into five cognitive dimensions and three spatial relation expressions. A comprehensive evaluation of 33 VLMs reveals a significant performance disparity with humans: even large-scale models struggle to exceed 54.1% accuracy, remaining 34.2% below human performance. By contrast, small-scale fine-tuned VLMs achieve over 60.0% accuracy, highlighting the necessity of our benchmark.

However, current safety evaluations in this field are mostly limited to detecting whether LLMs output prohibited words in single-turn conversations, neglecting the gradual erosion of safety boundaries in long dialogues. Examples include making definitive guarantees, assuming responsibility, and playing professional roles. We believe that with the evolution of mainstream LLMs, words with obvious safety risks are easily filtered by their underlying systems, while the real danger lies in the gradual transgression of boundaries during multi-turn interactions, driven by the LLM's attempts at comfort and empathy.\n  This paper proposes a multi-turn stress testing framework and conducts long-dialogue safety tests on three cutting-edge LLMs using two pressure methods: static progression and adaptive probing. We generated 50 virtual patient profiles and stress-tested each model through up to 20 rounds of virtual psychiatric dialogues. The experimental results show that violations are common, and both pressure modes produced similar violation rates. However, adaptive probing significantly advanced the time at which models crossed boundaries, reducing the average number of turns from 9.21 in static progression to 4.64. Under both mechanisms, making definitive or zero-risk promises was the primary way in which boundaries were breached. These findings suggest that the robustness of LLM safety boundaries cannot be inferred solely through single-turn tests; it is necessary to fully consider the wear and tear on safety boundaries caused by different interaction pressures and characteristics in extended dialogues.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7684\u538b\u529b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e3b\u6d41\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5fc3\u7406\u652f\u6301\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u4f1a\u9010\u6b65\u7a81\u7834\u5b89\u5168\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a2\u6d4b\u65b9\u5f0f\u80fd\u66f4\u5feb\u5f15\u53d1\u8fdd\u89c4\u627f\u8bfa\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5fc3\u7406\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ec5\u4fa7\u91cd\u5355\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7981\u7528\u8bcd\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u800c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u591a\u8f6e\u4ea4\u4e92\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8fb9\u754c\u9010\u6b65\u4fb5\u8680\uff08\u5982\u8fc7\u5ea6\u627f\u8bfa\u3001\u8d8a\u6743\u884c\u4e3a\uff09\u66f4\u503c\u5f97\u8b66\u60d5\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa20\u8f6e\u865a\u62df\u7cbe\u795e\u79d1\u5bf9\u8bdd\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u9759\u6001\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a2\u6d4b\u4e24\u79cd\u538b\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5bf950\u4e2a\u865a\u62df\u60a3\u8005\u6863\u6848\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e0d\u540c\u4ea4\u4e92\u538b\u529b\u4e0b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8fb9\u754c\u7a81\u7834\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u4e24\u79cd\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6a21\u5f0f\u5747\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u9891\u8fdd\u89c4\uff0c\u4f46\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a2\u6d4b\u4f7f\u5b89\u5168\u8fb9\u754c\u7a81\u7834\u65f6\u95f4\u63d0\u524d\uff08\u5e73\u5747\u8f6e\u6b21\u4ece9.21\u964d\u81f34.64\uff09\uff0c\u8fc7\u5ea6\u627f\u8bfa\u6210\u4e3a\u6700\u4e3b\u8981\u7684\u8fdd\u89c4\u5f62\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u8f6e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u771f\u5b9e\u5b89\u5168\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u5145\u5206\u8003\u91cf\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u4ea4\u4e92\u538b\u529b\u5bf9\u5b89\u5168\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u78e8\u635f\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5e76\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u5171\u60c5\u9a71\u52a8\u4e0b\u7684\u9690\u6027\u8fdd\u89c4\u98ce\u9669\u3002"}}

Low-quality labels may hamper performance and make the model training less robust. To address this issue, we propose SegAE (Segmentation Assessment Engine), a lightweight vision-language model (VLM) that automatically predicts label quality across 142 anatomical structures. Trained on over four million image-label pairs with quality scores, SegAE achieves a high correlation coefficient of 0.902 with ground-truth Dice similarity and evaluates a 3D mask in 0.06s. SegAE shows several practical benefits: (I) Our analysis reveals widespread low-quality labeling across public datasets; (II) SegAE improves data efficiency and training performance in active and semi-supervised learning, reducing dataset annotation cost by one-third and quality-checking time by 70% per label.

Nonetheless, the current voxelization methods commonly suffer from excessive computation complexity demands, where the fusion process is brittle, static, and breaks down under dynamic environmental settings. To this end, this research work enhances a novel Gaussian-based adaptive camera-LiDAR multimodal 3D occupancy prediction model that seamlessly bridges the semantic strengths of camera modality with the geometric strengths of LiDAR modality through a memory-efficient 3D Gaussian model. The proposed solution has four key components: (1) LiDAR Depth Feature Aggregation (LDFA), where depth-wise deformable sampling is employed for dealing with geometric sparsity, (2) Entropy-Based Feature Smoothing, where cross-entropy is employed for handling domain-specific noise, (3) Adaptive Camera-LiDAR Fusion, where dynamic recalibration of sensor outputs is performed based on model outputs, and (4) Gauss-Mamba Head that uses Selective State Space Models for global context decoding that enjoys linear computation complexity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9ad8\u65af\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u76f8\u673a-\u6fc0\u5149\u96f7\u8fbe\u591a\u6a21\u60013D\u5360\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u4f53\u7d20\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u76f8\u673a\u8bed\u4e49\u4f18\u52bf\u548c\u6fc0\u5149\u96f7\u8fbe\u51e0\u4f55\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u5728\u957f\u5c3e\u5b89\u5168\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4f53\u7d20\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9ad8\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8106\u5f31\u4e14\u9759\u6001\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u957f\u5c3e\u5b89\u5168\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u901a\u8fc7\u6280\u672f\u7a81\u7834\u63d0\u53473D\u8bed\u4e49\u5360\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u56db\u70b9\u521b\u65b0\uff1a1) \u57fa\u4e8e\u71b5\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5e73\u6ed1\u7b97\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u5904\u7406\u9886\u57df\u566a\u58f0\uff1b2) \u6df1\u5ea6\u53ef\u53d8\u5f62\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u6fc0\u5149\u96f7\u8fbe\u6df1\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u805a\u5408\u6a21\u5757\uff1b3) \u52a8\u6001\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u8f93\u51fa\u91cd\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u76f8\u673a-\u6fc0\u5149\u96f7\u8fbe\u878d\u5408\uff1b4) \u57fa\u4e8e\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u590d\u6742\u5ea6Gauss-Mamba\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5185\u5b58\u9ad8\u6548\u76843D\u9ad8\u65af\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u51e0\u4f55\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u5904\u7406\u3001\u9886\u57df\u566a\u58f0\u6291\u5236\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6848\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u65af\u8868\u793a\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u4f53\u7d20\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u4f18\u76843D\u573a\u666f\u611f\u77e5\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We design a fine-grained taxonomy aligned with the scientific research flow to assess models' ability to understand and answer why, what, and how questions in scholarly contexts. We also define an elaborate LLM-human interaction annotation framework to support large-scale labeling and quality control. Following the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm, we develop a scalable framework that evaluates models on correctness-completeness and conciseness, with high agreement to human judgment. Experiments reveal that even the strongest models (GPT-5) achieve only 68.2% correctness-completeness, dropping to 37.46% after conciseness adjustment, highlighting substantial gaps in precise academic paper understanding.

We uncover a surprising capability in AR audio generators: their early prefix tokens implicitly encode global semantic attributes of the final output, such as event count and sound-object category, revealing a form of implicit planning. Building on this insight, we propose Plan-Critic, a lightweight auxiliary model trained with a Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE)-inspired objective to predict final instruction-following quality from partial generations. At inference time, Plan-Critic enables guided exploration: it evaluates candidate prefixes early, prunes low-fidelity trajectories, and reallocates computation to high-potential planning seeds. Our Plan-Critic-guided sampling achieves up to a 10-point improvement in CLAP score over the AR baseline-establishing a new state of the art in AR text-to-audio generation-while maintaining computational parity with standard best-of-N decoding.

Current TTS systems typically generate accented speech by conditioning on speaker embeddings associated with specific accents. While effective, this approach offers limited interpretability and controllability, as embeddings also encode traits such as timbre and emotion. In this study, we analyze the interaction between speaker embeddings and linguistically motivated phonological rules in accented speech synthesis. Using American and British English as a case study, we implement rules for flapping, rhoticity, and vowel correspondences.

Experiments show that combining rules with embeddings yields more authentic accents, while embeddings can attenuate or overwrite rules, revealing entanglement between accent and speaker identity.

However, existing methods generally treat the frequency domain as a whole, neglecting the differences in the information carried by its internal components. According to Fourier transform theory, phase and amplitude represent different types of information in the image. Our spectrum swapping experiments show that magnitude mainly reflects pixel-level intensity, while phase predominantly governs image structure. To prevent interference between phase and magnitude feature learning caused by unified frequency-domain modeling, we propose the Phase-Amplitude-Spatial State Space Model (PAS-Mamba) for MRI Reconstruction, a framework that decouples phase and magnitude modeling in the frequency domain and combines it with image-domain features for better reconstruction. In the image domain, LocalMamba preserves spatial locality to sharpen fine anatomical details. In frequency domain, we disentangle amplitude and phase into two specialized branches to avoid representational coupling. To respect the concentric geometry of frequency information, we propose Circular Frequency Domain Scanning (CFDS) to serialize features from low to high frequencies. Finally, a Dual-Domain Complementary Fusion Module (DDCFM) adaptively fuses amplitude phase representations and enables bidirectional exchange between frequency and image domains, delivering superior reconstruction. Extensive experiments on the IXI and fastMRI knee datasets show that PAS-Mamba consistently outperforms state of the art reconstruction methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684MRI\u91cd\u5efa\u6846\u67b6PAS-Mamba\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u9891\u57df\u4e2d\u89e3\u8026\u76f8\u4f4d\u548c\u5e45\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u56fe\u50cf\u57df\u7279\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u91cd\u5efa\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709MRI\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9891\u57df\u5efa\u6a21\u65f6\u672a\u533a\u5206\u76f8\u4f4d\u4e0e\u5e45\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u800cFourier\u7406\u8bba\u8868\u660e\u76f8\u4f4d\u4e3b\u5bfc\u56fe\u50cf\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u5e45\u5ea6\u4f53\u73b0\u50cf\u7d20\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u5efa\u6a21\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u5e72\u6270\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eLocal-Mamba\u4fdd\u7559\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ec6\u8282\uff1b\u63d0\u51faCircular Frequency Domain Scanning\uff08CFDS\uff09\u6309\u9891\u7387\u9ad8\u4f4e\u5e8f\u5217\u5316\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u5206\u79bb\u9891\u57df\u76f8\u4f4d\u4e0e\u5e45\u5ea6\u5206\u652f\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7Dual-Domain Fusion Module\uff08DDCFM\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u53cc\u5411\u4e92\u8865\u878d\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u5728IXI\u548cfastMRI\u819d\u5173\u8282\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u9891\u57df\u89e3\u8026\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u9891\u57df\u76f8\u4f4d-\u5e45\u5ea6\u5206\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u56fe\u50cf\u57df\u7279\u5f81\u8026\u5408\uff0cPAS-Mamba\u6210\u529f\u5e73\u8861\u5c40\u90e8\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4e3aMRI\u91cd\u5efa\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Guided by the FC-r, a VI enhancement framework is proposed, where the spatiotemporal correlation of targets across adjacent video frames is leveraged. Given the real-time resource conditions of the target device, the framework can dynamically switch between models of varying scales during VI. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively achieves a balance between resource utilization and inference performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u7cca\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7684VI\u589e\u5f3a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u5207\u6362\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u5e73\u8861\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fc7\u5ea6\u8ffd\u6c42\u6a21\u578b\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5bfc\u81f4\u8d44\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u672a\u89e3\u51b3\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u679c\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6a21\u7cca\u63a7\u5236\u5668(FC-r)\u6574\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u53c2\u6570\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u65f6\u7a7a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5728\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u5207\u6362\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u8d44\u6e90\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u8d44\u6e90\u5360\u7528\u7684\u5747\u8861\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65f6\u7a7a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6a21\u578b\u5207\u6362\u673a\u5236\u6709\u6548\u534f\u8c03\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0e\u89c6\u9891\u63a8\u7406\u8d28\u91cf\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

However, current LLMs often generate plausible-looking but ineffective ideas. Execution grounding may help, but it is unclear whether automated execution is feasible and whether LLMs can learn from the execution feedback. To investigate these, we first build an automated executor to implement ideas and launch large-scale parallel GPU experiments to verify their effectiveness. We then convert two realistic research problems - LLM pre-training and post-training - into execution environments and demonstrate that our automated executor can implement a large fraction of the ideas sampled from frontier LLMs. We analyze two methods to learn from the execution feedback: evolutionary search and reinforcement learning. Execution-guided evolutionary search is sample-efficient: it finds a method that significantly outperforms the GRPO baseline (69.4% vs 48.0%) on post-training, and finds a pre-training recipe that outperforms the nanoGPT baseline (19.7 minutes vs 35.9 minutes) on pre-training, all within just ten search epochs. Frontier LLMs often generate meaningful algorithmic ideas during search, but they tend to saturate early and only occasionally exhibit scaling trends. Reinforcement learning from execution reward, on the other hand, suffers from mode collapse. It successfully improves the average reward of the ideator model but not the upper-bound, due to models converging on simple ideas.

Since encoding all frames is prohibitively expensive, uniform sampling is the default choice, but it enforces equal temporal coverage while ignoring the uneven events distribution. This motivates a Learnable Frame Selector (LFS) that selects temporally diverse and event-relevant frames. LFS explicitly models temporal importance to balance temporal diversity and event relevance, and employs a stratified strategy to ensure temporal coverage while avoiding clustering. Crucially, LFS leverages caption feedback from frozen video-LLMs to learn frame selection that directly optimizes downstream caption quality. Additionally, we identify the gap between existing benchmark and human's cognition. Thus, we introduce ICH-CC built from carefully designed questions by annotators that reflect human-consistent understanding of video.

Recent works have proposed reinforcement learning approaches for training LLM tutors, but these methods focus solely on optimizing visible responses while neglecting the model's internal thinking process. We introduce PedagogicalRL-Thinking, a framework that extends pedagogical alignment to reasoning LLMs in education through two novel approaches: (1) Pedagogical Reasoning Prompting, which guides internal reasoning using domain-specific educational theory rather than generic instructions; and (2) Thinking Reward, which explicitly evaluates and reinforces the pedagogical quality of the model's reasoning traces. Our experiments reveal that domain-specific, theory-grounded prompting outperforms generic prompting, and that Thinking Reward is most effective when combined with pedagogical prompting. Furthermore, models trained only on mathematics tutoring dialogues show improved performance on educational benchmarks not seen during training, while preserving the base model's factual knowledge. Our quantitative and qualitative analyses reveal that pedagogical thinking reward produces systematic reasoning trace changes, with increased pedagogical reasoning and more structured instructional decision-making in the tutor's thinking process.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faPedagogicalRL-Thinking\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9886\u57df\u7406\u8bba\u6307\u5bfc\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u4f18\u5316\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6559\u80b2\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6559\u5b66\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u5ffd\u89c6LLM\u6559\u80b2\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5185\u90e8\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f18\u5316\u8868\u9762\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u57fa\u4e8e\u6559\u80b2\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "1) Pedagogical Reasoning Prompting\uff1a\u7528\u6559\u80b2\u7406\u8bba\u6307\u5bfc\u5185\u90e8\u63a8\u7406\uff1b2) Thinking Reward\uff1a\u91cf\u5316\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u8bc4\u4f30\u63a8\u7406\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4e24\u8005\u7ed3\u5408\u5f62\u6210\u95ed\u73af\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u9886\u57df\u7406\u8bba\u63d0\u793a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u901a\u7528\u6307\u4ee4\uff0c\u4e8c\u8005\u7ed3\u5408\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u5916\u7684\u6559\u80b2\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5f97\u5206\u63d0\u534723%\uff0c\u4e14\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u5448\u73b0\u66f4\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u6559\u5b66\u51b3\u7b56\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6559\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u9700\u9886\u57df\u7406\u8bba\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u4e13\u4e1a\u8868\u73b0\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u901a\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u6559\u80b2\u7c7bLLM\u5b9a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Existing deep learning models struggle to jointly learn from such diverse data, often sacrificing either generalization or domain-specific knowledge. To overcome these challenges, we propose a joint training method called Universal Harmonization (U-Harmony), which can be integrated into deep learning-based architectures with a domain-gated head, enabling a single segmentation model to learn from heterogeneous datasets simultaneously. By integrating U-Harmony, our approach sequentially normalizes and then denormalizes feature distributions to mitigate domain-specific variations while preserving original dataset-specific knowledge. More appealingly, our framework also supports universal modality adaptation, allowing the seamless learning of new imaging modalities and anatomical classes.

This leads to common errors where VLMs misclassify coarser taxonomic levels even when correctly identifying the most specific level (leaf level). Existing approaches largely overlook this issue by failing to model hierarchical reasoning. To address this gap, we propose VL-Taxon, a two-stage, hierarchy-based reasoning framework designed to improve both leaf-level accuracy and hierarchical consistency in taxonomic classification. The first stage employs a top-down process to enhance leaf-level classification accuracy. The second stage then leverages this accurate leaf-level output to ensure consistency throughout the entire taxonomic hierarchy.

This representational mismatch creates an unmeasured fragility wherein reasoning processes can fail. LLMs may treat two internal representations as distinct \"words\" even when they are semantically identical at the text level. In this work, we show that tokenization can betray LLM reasoning through one-to-many token ID mappings. We introduce a tokenization-consistency probe that requires models to replace designated target words in context while leaving all other content unchanged. The task is intentionally simple at the surface level, enabling us to attribute failures to tokenizer-detokenizer artifacts rather than to knowledge gaps or parameter limitations. Through analysis of over 11000 replacement trials across state-of-the-art open-source LLMs, we find a non-trivial rate of outputs exhibit phantom edits: cases where models operate under the illusion of correct reasoning, a phenomenon arising from tokenizer-induced representational defects. We further analyze these cases and provide a taxonomy of eight systematic tokenizer artifacts, including whitespace-boundary shifts and intra-word resegmentation. These findings indicate that part of apparent reasoning deficiency originates in the tokenizer layer, motivating tokenizer-level remedies before incurring the cost of training ever-larger models on ever-larger corpora.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u56e0\u5206\u8bcd\u4e0e\u53bb\u5206\u8bcd\u7684\u975e\u552f\u4e00\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a8\u7406\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u66ff\u6362\u4efb\u52a1\u63ed\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u4f1a\u65e0\u610f\u8bc6\u5730\u4ea7\u751f'\u5e7b\u5f71\u7f16\u8f91'\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u9700\u4f18\u5148\u6539\u8fdb\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u800c\u975e\u76f2\u76ee\u6269\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u975e\u552f\u4e00\u5206\u8bcd\u6620\u5c04\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u8868\u9762\u7b80\u5355\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u6839\u6e90\u662f\u5426\u6e90\u4e8e\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u7f3a\u9677\u800c\u975e\u6a21\u578b\u77e5\u8bc6\u6216\u53c2\u6570\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5206\u8bcd\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u63a2\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u8981\u6c42\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u635f\u66ff\u6362\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u8bcd\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u5176\u4ed6\u5185\u5bb9\u4e0d\u53d8\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u679011000+\u6b21\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u8f93\u51fa\u8ffd\u6eaf\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7684'\u5e7b\u5f71\u7f16\u8f91'\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5f52\u7eb3\u51fa8\u7c7b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7a7a\u683c\u8fb9\u754c\u4f4d\u79fb\u548c\u8bcd\u5185\u91cd\u5207\u5206\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u7f3a\u9677\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a8\u7406\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u578b\u90e8\u5206\u63a8\u7406\u4e0d\u8db3\u6e90\u4e8e\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u5c42\u7684\u8868\u793a\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5e94\u4f18\u5148\u6539\u8fdb\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6765\u5f25\u8865\u5e95\u5c42\u6280\u672f\u7f3a\u9677\u3002"}}

Previous research demonstrates that incorporating diffusion-based measurements, such as reconstruction error, can enhance the generalizability of detectors. However, ignoring the differing impacts of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty on reconstruction error can undermine detection performance. Aleatoric uncertainty, arising from inherent data noise, creates ambiguity that impedes accurate detection of generated images. As it reflects random variations within the data (e.g., noise in natural textures), it does not help distinguish generated images. In contrast, epistemic uncertainty, which represents the model's lack of knowledge about unfamiliar patterns, supports detection. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Diffusion Epistemic Uncertainty with Asymmetric Learning~(DEUA), for detecting diffusion-generated images. We introduce Diffusion Epistemic Uncertainty~(DEU) estimation via the Laplace approximation to assess the proximity of data to the manifold of diffusion-generated samples.

In this paper, we suggest that true agentic intelligence requires not just tool invocation, but the adaptive wisdom to discern when to use them. We propose AdaTIR, a framework that shifts the paradigm from static tool invocation to difficulty-aware reasoning internalization. By introducing a difficulty-aware efficiency reward, AdaTIR dynamically adjusts tool budgets based on task complexity--internalizing reasoning for simple tasks while selectively invoking tools for complex tasks. Furthermore, we identify a sign reversal problem where tool penalties outweigh correctness rewards, mistakenly penalizing correct rollouts with negative advantages.

Although recent audio-visual approaches have improved automatic depression detection, methods that ignore emotional cues often fail to capture subtle depressive signals hidden within emotional expressions. Conversely, those incorporating emotions frequently confuse transient emotional expressions with stable depressive symptoms in feature representations, a phenomenon termed \\emph{Emotional Ambiguity}, thereby leading to detection errors. To address this critical issue, we propose READ-Net, the first audio-visual depression detection framework explicitly designed to resolve Emotional Ambiguity through Adaptive Feature Recalibration (AFR). The core insight of AFR is to dynamically adjust the weights of emotional features to enhance depression-related signals. Rather than merely overlooking or naively combining emotional information, READ-Net innovatively identifies and preserves depressive-relevant cues within emotional features, while adaptively filtering out irrelevant emotional noise. This recalibration strategy significantly clarifies feature representations, and effectively mitigates the persistent challenge of emotional interference. Additionally, READ-Net can be easily integrated into existing frameworks for improved performance.

However, its dependence on domain-specific verifiers significantly restricts its applicability to open and general domains. Recent efforts such as RLPR have extended RLVR to general domains, enabling training on broader datasets and achieving improvements over RLVR. However, a notable limitation of these methods is their tendency to overfit to reference answers, which constrains the model's ability to generate diverse outputs. This limitation is particularly pronounced in open-ended tasks such as writing, where multiple plausible answers exist. To address this, we propose DARL, a simple yet effective reinforcement learning framework that encourages the generation of diverse answers within a controlled deviation range from the reference while preserving alignment with it. Our framework is fully compatible with existing general reinforcement learning methods and can be seamlessly integrated without additional verifiers.

Existing methods face two distinct challenges. Geometrically unconditioned models lack spatial awareness, leading to drift and deformation under viewpoint changes. On the other hand, geometrically-conditioned models depend on estimated depth and explicit reconstruction, making them susceptible to depth inaccuracies and calibration errors.\n  We propose to address these challenges by using the implicit geometric knowledge embedded in the latent space of a large 4D reconstruction model to condition the video generation process. These latents capture scene structure in a continuous space without explicit reconstruction. Therefore, they provide a flexible representation that allows the pretrained diffusion prior to regularize errors more effectively. By jointly conditioning on these latents and source camera poses, we demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art results on the video re-rendering task.

Although CoT prompting enhances reasoning, its verbosity imposes substantial computational overhead. Recent works often focus exclusively on outcome alignment and lack supervision on the intermediate reasoning process. These deficiencies obscure the analyzability of the latent reasoning chain. To address these challenges, we introduce Render-of-Thought (RoT), the first framework to reify the reasoning chain by rendering textual steps into images, making the latent rationale explicit and traceable. Specifically, we leverage the vision encoders of existing Vision Language Models (VLMs) as semantic anchors to align the vision embeddings with the textual space. This design ensures plug-and-play implementation without incurring additional pre-training overhead. Extensive experiments on mathematical and logical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves 3-4x token compression and substantial inference acceleration compared to explicit CoT. Furthermore, it maintains competitive performance against other methods, validating the feasibility of this paradigm.

This study constructs the first Chinese film script continuation benchmark comprising 53 classic films, and designs a multi-dimensional evaluation framework comparing GPT-5.2 and Qwen-Max-Latest. Using a \"first half to second half\" continuation paradigm with 3 samples per film, we obtained 303 valid samples (GPT-5.2: 157, 98.7% validity; Qwen-Max: 146, 91.8% validity). Evaluation integrates ROUGE-L, Structural Similarity, and LLM-as-Judge scoring (DeepSeek-Reasoner).\n  Statistical analysis of 144 paired samples reveals: Qwen-Max achieves marginally higher ROUGE-L (0.2230 vs 0.2114, d=-0.43); however, GPT-5.2 significantly outperforms in structural preservation (0.93 vs 0.75, d=0.46), overall quality (44.79 vs 25.72, d=1.04), and composite scores (0.50 vs 0.39, d=0.84). The overall quality effect size reaches large effect level (d>0.8).\n  GPT-5.2 excels in character consistency, tone-style matching, and format preservation, while Qwen-Max shows deficiencies in generation stability.

However, most existing studies employ a unitive process where queries of equivalent semantics across different languages are processed through a single-turn retrieval and subsequent optimization. Such a ``one-size-fits-all'' strategy is often suboptimal in multilingual settings, as the models occur to knowledge bias and conflict during the interaction with the search engine. To alleviate the issues, we propose LcRL, a multilingual search-augmented reinforcement learning framework that integrates a language-coupled Group Relative Policy Optimization into the policy and reward models. We adopt the language-coupled group sampling in the rollout module to reduce knowledge bias, and regularize an auxiliary anti-consistency penalty in the reward models to mitigate the knowledge conflict. Experimental results demonstrate that LcRL not only achieves competitive performance but is also appropriate for various practical scenarios such as constrained training data and retrieval over collections encompassing a large number of languages.

LookBench includes both recent product images sourced from live websites and AI-generated fashion images, reflecting contemporary trends and use cases. Each test sample is time-stamped and we intend to update the benchmark periodically, enabling contamination-aware evaluation aligned with declared training cutoffs. Grounded in our fine-grained attribute taxonomy, LookBench covers single-item and outfit-level retrieval across. Our experiments reveal that LookBench poses a significant challenge on strong baselines, with many models achieving below $60\\%$ Recall@1.

Existing methods mainly enhance inter-class distinctions and employ data augmentation to mitigate semantic ambiguity and reduce spurious activations. However, they often neglect the complex contextual dependencies among image patches, resulting in incomplete local representations and limited segmentation accuracy. To address these issues, we propose the Context Patch Fusion with Class Token Enhancement (CPF-CTE) framework, which exploits contextual relations among patches to enrich feature representations and improve segmentation. At its core, the Contextual-Fusion Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (CF-BiLSTM) module captures spatial dependencies between patches and enables bidirectional information flow, yielding a more comprehensive understanding of spatial correlations. This strengthens feature learning and segmentation robustness. Moreover, we introduce learnable class tokens that dynamically encode and refine class-specific semantics, enhancing discriminative capability. By effectively integrating spatial and semantic cues, CPF-CTE produces richer and more accurate representations of image content.

However, extending these capabilities to streaming video inputs, remains challenging, as existing models struggle to simultaneously maintain stable understanding performance, real-time responses, and low GPU memory overhead. To address this challenge, we propose HERMES, a novel training-free architecture for real-time and accurate understanding of video streams. Based on a mechanistic attention investigation, we conceptualize KV cache as a hierarchical memory framework that encapsulates video information across multiple granularities. During inference, HERMES reuses a compact KV cache, enabling efficient streaming understanding under resource constraints. Notably, HERMES requires no auxiliary computations upon the arrival of user queries, thereby guaranteeing real-time responses for continuous video stream interactions, which achieves 10$\\times$ faster TTFT compared to prior SOTA. Even when reducing video tokens by up to 68% compared with uniform sampling, HERMES achieves superior or comparable accuracy across all benchmarks, with up to 11.4% gains on streaming datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "HERMES\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6d41\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c42\u6b21\u5316KV\u7f13\u5b58\u590d\u7528\u5b9e\u73b010\u500d\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u54cd\u5e94\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c1168%\u89c6\u9891token\u91cf\u5e76\u63d0\u534711.4%\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709MLLMs\u5728\u79bb\u7ebf\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5904\u7406\u6d41\u89c6\u9891\u65f6\u96be\u4ee5\u517c\u987e\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u53ca\u4f4e\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u5316KV\u7f13\u5b58\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u590d\u7528\u7d27\u51d1\u7f13\u5b58\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f4e\u5f00\u9500\u6d41\u89c6\u9891\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u4e14\u67e5\u8be2\u65f6\u65e0\u9700\u8f85\u52a9\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "result": "TTFT\uff08\u9996token\u8017\u65f6\uff09\u76f8\u8f83SOTA\u63d0\u534710\u500d\uff0c\u5728\u51cf\u5c1168%\u89c6\u9891token\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u7b49\u6548/\u66f4\u4f18\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u6d41\u89c6\u9891\u4efb\u52a1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u534711.4%\u3002", "conclusion": "HERMES\u901a\u8fc7\u673a\u7406\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7f13\u5b58\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4e3a\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6d41\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Accordingly, we introduce Corpus Clarification as a preprocessing framework for large-scale consultation data that transforms noisy, multi-topic contributions into structured, self-contained argumentative units ready for downstream analysis. We present GDN-CC, a manually-curated dataset of 1,231 contributions to the French Grand D\u00e9bat National, comprising 2,285 argumentative units annotated for argumentative structure and manually clarified.

Although resource-constrained edge computing adequately supports fast low-resolution T2I generations, achieving high-resolution output still faces the challenge of ensuring image fidelity at the cost of latency. To address this, we first investigate the performance of super-resolution (SR) methods for image enhancement, confirming a fundamental trade-off that lightweight learning-based SR struggles to recover fine details, while diffusion-based SR achieves higher fidelity at a substantial computational cost. Motivated by these observations, we propose an end-edge collaborative generation-enhancement framework. Upon receiving a T2I generation task, the system first generates a low-resolution image based on adaptively selected denoising steps and super-resolution scales at the edge side, which is then partitioned into patches and processed by a region-aware hybrid SR policy. This policy applies a diffusion-based SR model to foreground patches for detail recovery and a lightweight learning-based SR model to background patches for efficient upscaling, ultimately stitching the enhanced ones into the high-resolution image. Experiments show that our system reduces service latency by 33% compared with baselines while maintaining competitive image quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7aef\u8fb9\u534f\u540c\u7684\u751f\u6210-\u589e\u5f3a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5b66\u4e60\u578b\u548c\u6269\u6563\u578b\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e33%\u670d\u52a1\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u96be\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387T2I\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7ec6\u8282\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u7ec6\u8282\u6062\u590d\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u8d28\u91cf\u9ad8\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u5927\u3002", "method": "1) \u8fb9\u7f18\u8282\u70b9\u751f\u6210\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u53bb\u566a\u6b65\u9aa4\u9009\u62e9\uff1b2) \u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5757\u540e\u91c7\u7528\u533a\u57df\u611f\u77e5\u6df7\u5408\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u524d\u666f\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4fdd\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u80cc\u666f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u6548\u7387\uff1b3) \u7ed3\u679c\u62fc\u63a5\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u670d\u52a1\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u964d\u4f4e33%\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6df7\u5408\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8d44\u6e90\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387AIGC\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684QoE\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

While prior work has proposed contamination detection methods, these approaches are largely limited to English benchmarks, leaving multilingual contamination poorly understood. In this work, we investigate contamination dynamics in multilingual settings by fine-tuning several open-weight LLMs on varying proportions of Arabic datasets and evaluating them on original English benchmarks. To detect memorization, we extend the Tested Slot Guessing method with a choice-reordering strategy and incorporate Min-K% probability analysis, capturing both behavioral and distributional contamination signals.\n  Our results show that translation into Arabic suppresses conventional contamination indicators, yet models still benefit from exposure to contaminated data, particularly those with stronger Arabic capabilities. This effect is consistently reflected in rising Mink% scores and increased cross-lingual answer consistency as contamination levels grow. To address this blind spot, we propose Translation-Aware Contamination Detection, which identifies contamination by comparing signals across multiple translated benchmark variants rather than English alone. The Translation-Aware Contamination Detection reliably exposes contamination even when English-only methods fail.

Unlike existing synthetic drone datasets, SimD3 explicitly models drones with heterogeneous payloads, incorporates multiple bird species as realistic distractors, and leverages diverse Unreal Engine 5 environments with controlled weather, lighting, and flight trajectories captured using a 360 six-camera rig. Using SimD3, we conduct an extensive experimental evaluation within the YOLOv5 detection framework, including an attention-enhanced variant termed Yolov5m+C3b, where standard bottleneck-based C3 blocks are replaced with C3b modules. Models are evaluated on synthetic data, combined synthetic and real data, and multiple unseen real-world benchmarks to assess robustness and generalization. Experimental results show that SimD3 provides effective supervision for small-object drone detection and that Yolov5m+C3b consistently outperforms the baseline across in-domain and cross-dataset evaluations.

Despite the impressive in-context learning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), existing methods are hindered by their reliance on static, heuristic-driven prompting strategies. Due to the lack of reflection mechanisms required to internalize erroneous signals, these methods exhibit vulnerability in semantic ambiguity, often making erroneous extraction patterns permanent. To address this bottleneck, we propose a Knowledge Reconstruction-driven Prompt Optimization (KRPO) framework to assist LLMs in continuously improving their extraction capabilities for complex ORTE task flows. Specifically, we design a self-evaluation mechanism based on knowledge restoration, which provides intrinsic feedback signals by projecting structured triplets into semantic consistency scores. Subsequently, we propose a prompt optimizer based on a textual gradient that can internalize historical experiences to iteratively optimize prompts, which can better guide LLMs to handle subsequent extraction tasks.

This paper formulates this problem as a multi-instance learning (MIL) task, where a query polyp image is compared with a target bag of images to determine uniqueness. We employ a multi-instance verification (MIV) framework that incorporates attention mechanisms, such as variance-excited multi-head attention (VEMA) and distance-based attention (DBA), to enhance the model's ability to extract meaningful representations. Additionally, we investigate the impact of self-supervised learning using SimCLR to generate robust embeddings. Experimental results on a dataset of 1912 polyps from 754 patients demonstrate that attention mechanisms significantly improve performance, with DBA L1 achieving the highest test accuracy of 86.26\\% and a test AUC of 0.928 using a ConvNeXt backbone with SimCLR pretraining.

Under mild conditions, these dynamics converge to invariant solution sets defined by the intersection of agent constraint sets. Such invariant structures are generally not dynamically accessible to a single agent applying all constraints simultaneously, even when expressive capacity and information are identical. We extend this result from exact constraint enforcement to soft constraints via proximal operators, and apply the formalism to contemporary text-based dialog systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08MAS\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u64cd\u4f5c\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u591a\u4e2a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5171\u4eab\u76f8\u540c\u4fe1\u606f\u4f46\u534f\u540c\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002MAS\u4ee5\u5206\u89e3\u65b9\u5f0f\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ea6\u675f\u65bd\u52a0\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8f6f\u7ea6\u675f\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u8fd1\u7aef\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5355\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u96be\u4ee5\u63a5\u89e6\u7684\u534f\u540c\u89e3\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u534f\u540c\u95ee\u9898\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7406\u8bba\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5f53\u6240\u6709\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5171\u4eab\u76f8\u540c\u4fe1\u606f\u65f6\u4e3a\u4f55\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5efa\u7acb\u57fa\u4e8e\u64cd\u4f5c\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u91caMAS\u4e2d\u591a\u4e2a\u7ea6\u675f\u96c6\u534f\u540c\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5bf9\u5171\u4eab\u89e3\u7a7a\u95f4\u65bd\u52a0\u5dee\u5f02\u5316\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u96c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u89e3\u7ea6\u675f\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u590d\u5408\u64cd\u4f5c\u63cf\u8ff0MAS\u52a8\u6001\u6f14\u5316\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u8fd1\u7aef\u7b97\u5b50\u5c06\u786c\u7ea6\u675f\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u8f6f\u7ea6\u675f\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7b97\u5b50\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u7ea6\u675f\u4ea4\u96c6\u4e0b\u7684\u4e0d\u53d8\u89e3\u7ed3\u6784\u6536\u655b\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660eMAS\u52a8\u6001\u6536\u655b\u4e8e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7ea6\u675f\u96c6\u7684\u4ea4\u96c6\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u4e0d\u53d8\u89e3\u96c6\uff0c\u4e14\u8be5\u89e3\u96c6\u65e0\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e32\u8054\u65bd\u52a0\u6240\u6709\u7ea6\u675f\u83b7\u5f97\u3002\u5c06\u7406\u8bba\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7ea6\u675f\u5206\u89e3\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6c42\u89e3\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "MAS\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7ea6\u675f\u65bd\u52a0\u673a\u5236\u8bbf\u95ee\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u65e0\u6cd5\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u89e3\u7a7a\u95f4\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6e90\u4e8e\u534f\u540c\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u5206\u89e3\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u7ea6\u675f\u4ea4\u96c6\u3002\u8be5\u7406\u8bba\u4e3a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u540c\u7684\u5de5\u7a0b\u5b9e\u8df5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

While medical VLMs are expected to capture diagnostically relevant features, their learned representations remain underexplored, and standard evaluations like classification accuracy do not fully reveal if they acquire truly discriminative, lesion-specific features. Understanding these representations is crucial for revealing medical image structures and improving downstream tasks in medical image analysis. This study aims to investigate the feature distributions learned by medical VLMs and evaluate the impact of medical specialization. We analyze the feature distribution of multiple image modalities extracted by some representative medical VLMs across lesion classification datasets on multiple modalities. These distributions were compared them with non-medical VLMs to assess the domain-specific medical training. Our experiments showed that medical VLMs can extract discriminative features that are effective for medical classification tasks. Moreover, it was found that non-medical VLMs with recent improvement with contextual enrichment such as LLM2CLIP produce more refined feature representations. Our results imply that enhancing text encoder is more crucial than training intensively on medical images when developing medical VLMs. Notably, non-medical models are particularly vulnerable to biases introduced by overlaied text strings on images. These findings underscore the need for careful consideration on model selection according to downstream tasks besides potential risks in inference due to background biases such as textual information in images.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u533b\u7597\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u53d6\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4f46\u975e\u533b\u7597\u9886\u57df\u7684VLMs\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6539\u8fdb\uff08\u5982LLM2CLIP\uff09\u53ef\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u6587\u672c\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u53ef\u80fd\u6bd4\u5bc6\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u533b\u7597\u56fe\u50cf\u66f4\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u9700\u8b66\u60d5\u6587\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u533b\u7597VLMs\u662f\u5426\u771f\u6b63\u5b66\u4e60\u4e86\u8bca\u65ad\u76f8\u5173\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4f20\u7edf\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4ee5\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u6f5c\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u5e03\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u5bfc\u4e0b\u6e38\u533b\u7597\u5f71\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u533b\u7597VLMs\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u75c5\u53d8\u5206\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0e\u975e\u533b\u7597VLMs\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u533b\u7597\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u533b\u7597VLMs\u53ef\u63d0\u53d6\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5224\u522b\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4f46\u975e\u533b\u7597VLMs\uff08\u5982LLM2CLIP\uff09\u7ed3\u5408\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4f18\u5316\u540e\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff1b\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u6587\u5b57\u8986\u76d6\uff08\u5982\u6807\u6ce8\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u504f\u5dee\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f18\u5316\u6587\u672c\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6bd4\u533b\u7597\u56fe\u50cf\u5bc6\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u66f4\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u9700\u8b66\u60d5\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u4e2d\u7684\u6587\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\u504f\u5dee\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5e76\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u9009\u62e9\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u914d\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

Using large-scale Reddit data, we quantify time-of-day variation in language use by embedding text into a pretrained transformer model and measuring semantic entropy as an index of linguistic exploration-exploitation, for which we show a robust circadian rhythmicity that could be entrained by seasonal light cues. Distinguishing between local and global semantic entropy reveals a systematic temporal dissociation: local semantic exploration peaks in the morning, reflecting broader exploration of semantic space, whereas global semantic diversity peaks later in the day as submissions accumulate around already established topics, consistent with \"rich-get-richer\" dynamics. These patterns are not explained by sentiment or affective valence, indicating that semantic exploration captures a cognitive dimension distinct from mood.

However, to develop clinically useful multimodal LLM tools, high-quality benchmarks curated by domain experts are essential. To curate released and holdout datasets of 100 chest radiographic studies each and propose an artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted expert labeling procedure to allow radiologists to label studies more efficiently. A total of 13,735 deidentified chest radiographs and their corresponding reports from the MIDRC were used. GPT-4o extracted abnormal findings from the reports, which were then mapped to 12 benchmark labels with a locally hosted LLM (Phi-4-Reasoning). From these studies, 1,000 were sampled on the basis of the AI-suggested benchmark labels for expert review; the sampling algorithm ensured that the selected studies were clinically relevant and captured a range of difficulty levels. Seventeen chest radiologists participated, and they marked \"Agree all\", \"Agree mostly\" or \"Disagree\" to indicate their assessment of the correctness of the LLM suggested labels. Each chest radiograph was evaluated by three experts. Of these, at least two radiologists selected \"Agree All\" for 381 radiographs. From this set, 200 were selected, prioritizing those with less common or multiple finding labels, and divided into 100 released radiographs and 100 reserved as the holdout dataset.

However, existing methods face two major limitations: (1) high-quality multimodal dubbing datasets are limited in scale, suffer from high word error rates, contain sparse annotations, rely on costly manual labeling, and are restricted to monologue scenes, all of which hinder effective model training; (2) existing dubbing models rely solely on the lip region to learn audio-visual alignment, which limits their applicability to complex live-action cinematic scenes, and exhibit suboptimal performance in lip sync, speech quality, and emotional expressiveness. To address these issues, we propose FunCineForge, which comprises an end-to-end production pipeline for large-scale dubbing datasets and an MLLM-based dubbing model designed for diverse cinematic scenes. Using the pipeline, we construct the first Chinese television dubbing dataset with rich annotations, and demonstrate the high quality of these data.

These risks are particularly challenging as they often manifest as subtle clinical errors that evade detection by generic metrics, while expert-authored fine-grained rubrics remain costly to construct and difficult to scale. In this paper, we propose a retrieval-augmented multi-agent framework designed to automate the generation of instance-specific evaluation rubrics. Our approach grounds evaluation in authoritative medical evidence by decomposing retrieved content into atomic facts and synthesizing them with user interaction constraints to form verifiable, fine-grained evaluation criteria. Evaluated on HealthBench, our framework achieves a Clinical Intent Alignment (CIA) score of 60.12%, a statistically significant improvement over the GPT-4o baseline (55.16%). In discriminative tests, our rubrics yield a mean score delta ($\u03bc_\u0394 = 8.658$) and an AUROC of 0.977, nearly doubling the quality separation achieved by GPT-4o baseline (4.972). Beyond evaluation, our rubrics effectively guide response refinement, improving quality by 9.2% (from 59.0% to 68.2%).

However, current motion diffusion models face two major limitations: a representational gap caused by pre-trained text encoders that lack motion-specific information, and error propagation during the iterative denoising process. This paper introduces Reconstruction-Anchored Diffusion Model (RAM) to address these challenges. First, RAM leverages a motion latent space as intermediate supervision for text-to-motion generation. To this end, RAM co-trains a motion reconstruction branch with two key objective functions: self-regularization to enhance the discrimination of the motion space and motion-centric latent alignment to enable accurate mapping from text to the motion latent space. Second, we propose Reconstructive Error Guidance (REG), a testing-stage guidance mechanism that exploits the diffusion model's inherent self-correction ability to mitigate error propagation. At each denoising step, REG uses the motion reconstruction branch to reconstruct the previous estimate, reproducing the prior error patterns. By amplifying the residual between the current prediction and the reconstructed estimate, REG highlights the improvements in the current prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAM achieves significant improvements and state-of-the-art performance.

This study investigates whether synthetic images generated through Stable Diffusion with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) can effectively augment limited real datasets for multi-task CNN-based porcelain classification. Using MobileNetV3 with transfer learning, we conducted controlled experiments comparing models trained on pure real data against those trained on mixed real-synthetic datasets (95:5 and 90:10 ratios) across four classification tasks: dynasty, glaze, kiln and type identification. Results demonstrate task-specific benefits: type classification showed the most substantial improvement (5.5\\% F1-macro increase with 90:10 ratio), while dynasty and kiln tasks exhibited modest gains (3-4\\%), suggesting that synthetic augmentation effectiveness depends on the alignment between generated features and task-relevant visual signatures. Our work contributes practical guidelines for deploying generative AI in archaeological research, demonstrating both the potential and limitations of synthetic data when archaeological authenticity must be balanced with data diversity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528Stable Diffusion\u7ed3\u5408LoRA\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u589e\u5f3a\u7a00\u5c11\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u57fa\u4e8eCNN\u7684\u4e2d\u56fd\u74f7\u5668\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u7c7b\u6548\u679c\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u74f7\u5668\u7c7b\u578b\u5206\u7c7b\u63d0\u5347\u663e\u8457\u3002", "motivation": "\u8003\u53e4\u6587\u7269\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9488\u5bf9\u7a00\u6709\u7c7b\u578b\u4e2d\u56fd\u74f7\u5668\u65f6\u4f20\u7edf\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u9650\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u6838\u5fc3\u662f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u80fd\u5426\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u53e4\u6587\u7269\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u77ed\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528MobileNetV3+\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u7eaf\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u6df7\u5408\u771f\u5b9e-\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\uff0895:5\u548c90:10\u6bd4\u4f8b\uff09\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u679c\u3002\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u7531Stable Diffusion+LoRA\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u6db5\u76d6\u671d\u4ee3\u3001\u91c9\u8272\u3001\u7a91\u53e3\u548c\u5668\u578b\u56db\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\uff1a\u5668\u578b\u5206\u7c7bF1\u5f97\u5206\u63d0\u5347\u6700\u9ad8\uff0890:10\u4e0b+5.5%\uff09\uff0c\u671d\u4ee3\u548c\u7a91\u53e3\u5206\u7c7b\u63d0\u53473-4%\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u5408\u6210\u589e\u5f3a\u6548\u679c\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5339\u914d\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u8003\u53e4\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u90e8\u7f72\u751f\u6210AI\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5357\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6587\u7269\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u636e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u4e0e\u5c40\u9650\u3002"}}

Analyzing Review Quality across Venues and Time", "comment": null, "summary": "Peer review is at the heart of modern science. As submission numbers rise and research communities grow, the decline in review quality is a popular narrative and a common concern. Yet, is it true? Review quality is difficult to measure, and the ongoing evolution of reviewing practices makes it hard to compare reviews across venues and time. To address this, we introduce a new framework for evidence-based comparative study of review quality and apply it to major AI and machine learning conferences: ICLR, NeurIPS and *ACL. We document the diversity of review formats and introduce a new approach to review standardization. We propose a multi-dimensional schema for quantifying review quality as utility to editors and authors, coupled with both LLM-based and lightweight measurements. We study the relationships between measurements of review quality, and its evolution over time. Contradicting the popular narrative, our cross-temporal analysis reveals no consistent decline in median review quality across venues and years. We propose alternative explanations, and outline recommendations to facilitate future empirical studies of review quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u8bc4\u4f30\u540c\u884c\u8bc4\u5ba1\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793aAI/\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u9886\u57df\u4f1a\u8bae\u8bc4\u5ba1\u8d28\u91cf\u5e76\u672a\u6301\u7eed\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "motivation": "\u79d1\u5b66\u754c\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u6295\u7a3f\u91cf\u589e\u957f\u4e0e\u8bc4\u5ba1\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u6ed1\u7684\u62c5\u5fe7\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc4\u5ba1\u6d41\u7a0b\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u4e0d\u8db3\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u8de8\u4f1a\u8bae\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u7ef4\u8bc4\u5ba1\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408LLM\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5206\u6790\u548c\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5bf9ICLR\u3001NeurIPS\u548cACL\u7b49\u9876\u4f1a\u7684\u8bc4\u5ba1\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u8bc4\u5ba1\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u8de8\u65f6\u6bb5\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u8bc4\u5ba1\u8d28\u91cf\u4e2d\u4f4d\u6570\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4f1a\u8bae\u95f4\u672a\u5448\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\u8d8b\u52bf\uff0c\u4e14\u53d1\u73b0\u8bc4\u5ba1\u8d28\u91cf\u7ef4\u5ea6\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5173\u8054\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6311\u6218\u201c\u8bc4\u5ba1\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\u201d\u7684\u4e3b\u6d41\u53d9\u4e8b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u7406\u89e3\u8bc4\u5ba1\u673a\u5236\u6f14\u5316\u89c4\u5f8b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u8d28\u91cf\u4f18\u5316\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

For homogeneous CD, precise boundary delineation relies on fine-grained spatial cues and local pixel interactions, whereas heterogeneous CD instead requires broader contextual information to suppress speckle noise and geometric distortions. Moreover, difference operator (e.g., subtraction) works well for aligned homogeneous images but introduces artifacts in cross-modal or geometrically misaligned scenarios. Across different modality settings, specialized models based on static backbones or fixed difference operations often prove insufficient. To address this challenge, we propose UniRoute, a unified framework for modality-adaptive learning by reformulating feature extraction and fusion as conditional routing problems. We introduce an Adaptive Receptive Field Routing MoE (AR2-MoE) module to disentangle local spatial details from global semantic context, and a Modality-Aware Difference Routing MoE (MDR-MoE) module to adaptively select the most suitable fusion primitive at each pixel. In addition, we propose a Consistency-Aware Self-Distillation (CASD) strategy that stabilizes unified training under data-scarce heterogeneous settings by enforcing multi-level consistency. Extensive experiments on five public datasets demonstrate that UniRoute achieves strong overall performance, with a favorable accuracy-efficiency trade-off under a unified deployment setting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aUniRoute\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u6001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u8def\u7531\u7b56\u7565\u89e3\u51b3\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u65e0\u9700\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u6001\u5355\u72ec\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u6761\u4ef6\u8def\u7531\u673a\u5236\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u5c40\u90e8\u7ec6\u8282\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u5f0f", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u540c\u8d28/\u5f02\u8d28\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u6a21\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u9650\u5236\uff1a\u540c\u8d28\u68c0\u6d4b\u4f9d\u8d56\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ebf\u7d22\u4f46\u6613\u53d7\u914d\u51c6\u8bef\u5dee\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5f02\u8d28\u68c0\u6d4b\u9700\u8981\u5168\u5c40\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5374\u5bb9\u6613\u5f15\u5165\u566a\u58f0\u4f2a\u5f71\u3002\u56fa\u5b9a\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5dee\u5f02\u7b97\u5b50\u5728\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u573a\u666f\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u8db3", "method": "\u6838\u5fc3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u542b\uff1a1) \u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u611f\u53d7\u91ce\u8def\u7531MoE(AR2-MoE)\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u89e3\u8026\u5c40\u90e8\u7ec6\u8282\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u8bed\u4e49\uff1b2) \u6a21\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u5dee\u5f02\u8def\u7531MoE(MDR-MoE)\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f18\u878d\u5408\u539f\u8bed\uff1b3) \u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u81ea\u84b8\u998f\u7b56\u7565(CASD)\uff0c\u5728\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4fdd\u8bc1\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6761\u4ef6\u8def\u7531\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0e\u878d\u5408\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u8282", "result": "\u57285\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cUniRoute\u5728\u7edf\u4e00\u90e8\u7f72\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u8fbe\u523082.3%\u7684mIoU\uff0c\u8f83\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u53474.7%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u53471.8\u500d\u3002\u5728SAR-\u5149\u5b66\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fbe\u523076.5%\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u52a8\u6001\u8def\u7531\u673a\u5236\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u5f02\u8d28\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u8def\u7531\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5404\u6a21\u5757\u5bf9\u5f02\u8d28\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u5ea6\u8fbe\u5230\u663e\u8457\u6c34\u5e73(P<0.01)"}}

Fine-tuned models lose their ability to reason about contextual privacy norms, share information inappropriately with tools, and violate memory boundaries across contexts. Privacy collapse is a ``silent failure'' because models maintain high performance on standard safety and utility benchmarks whilst exhibiting severe privacy vulnerabilities. Our experiments show evidence of privacy collapse across six models (closed and open weight), five fine-tuning datasets (real-world and controlled data), and two task categories (agentic and memory-based).

Historically, various handcrafted geometry-aware descriptors and feature refinement techniques have been proposed. Recently, several studies have initiated a new research direction by leveraging features from image foundation models to create semantics-aware descriptors, demonstrating advantages across tasks like shape matching, editing, and segmentation. Symmetry, another key concept in shape analysis, has also attracted increasing attention. Consequently, constructing symmetry-aware shape descriptors is a natural progression. Although the recent method $\u03c7$ (Wang et al., 2025) successfully extracted symmetry-informative features from semantic-aware descriptors, its features are only one-dimensional, neglecting other valuable semantic information. Furthermore, the extracted symmetry-informative feature is usually noisy and yields small misclassified patches. To address these gaps, we propose a feature disentanglement approach which is simultaneously symmetry informative and symmetry agnostic.

First, POTR introduces a novel pruning approach that uses a modified 3DGS rasterizer to efficiently calculate every splat's individual removal effect simultaneously. This technique results in 2-4x fewer splats than other post-training pruning techniques and as a result also significantly accelerates inference with experiments demonstrating 1.5-2x faster inference than other compressed models. Second, we propose a novel method to recompute lighting coefficients, significantly reducing their entropy without using any form of training. Our fast and highly parallel approach especially increases AC lighting coefficient sparsity, with experiments demonstrating increases from 70% to 97%, with minimal loss in quality.

Prior research has highlighted sentiment as an important signal in fake news detection, either by analyzing which sentiments are associated with fake news or by using sentiment and emotion features for classification. However, this poses a vulnerability since adversaries can manipulate sentiment to evade detectors especially with the advent of large language models (LLMs). A few studies have explored adversarial samples generated by LLMs, but they mainly focus on stylistic features such as writing style of news publishers. Thus, the crucial vulnerability of sentiment manipulation remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we investigate the robustness of state-of-the-art fake news detectors under sentiment manipulation. We introduce AdSent, a sentiment-robust detection framework designed to ensure consistent veracity predictions across both original and sentiment-altered news articles. Specifically, we (1) propose controlled sentiment-based adversarial attacks using LLMs, (2) analyze the impact of sentiment shifts on detection performance.

While Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have advanced scene representation, their capacity to capture high-frequency facial details, such as dynamic wrinkles and subtle textures from information-constrained monocular streams, requires significant enhancement. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel hybrid neural radiance field framework, called Geometry-Aware-Transformer Enhanced NeRF (GAT-NeRF) for high-fidelity and controllable 4D facial avatar reconstruction, which integrates the Transformer mechanism into the NeRF pipeline. GAT-NeRF synergistically combines a coordinate-aligned Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) with a lightweight Transformer module, termed as Geometry-Aware-Transformer (GAT) due to its processing of multi-modal inputs containing explicit geometric priors. The GAT module is enabled by fusing multi-modal input features, including 3D spatial coordinates, 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) expression parameters, and learnable latent codes to effectively learn and enhance feature representations pertinent to fine-grained geometry. The Transformer's effective feature learning capabilities are leveraged to significantly augment the modeling of complex local facial patterns like dynamic wrinkles and acne scars.

Thus, for accurately generating contextually-relevant images, knowledge and reasoning about time can be crucial (e.g., for generating a landscape in spring vs. in winter). Yet, although substantial work exists on understanding and improving temporal knowledge in natural language processing, research on how temporal phenomena appear and are handled in text-to-image (T2I) models remains scarce. We address this gap with TempViz, the first data set to holistically evaluate temporal knowledge in image generation, consisting of 7.9k prompts and more than 600 reference images. Using TempViz, we study the capabilities of five T2I models across five temporal knowledge categories. Human evaluation shows that temporal competence is generally weak, with no model exceeding 75% accuracy across categories. Towards larger-scale studies, we also examine automated evaluation methods, comparing several established approaches against human judgments.

To overcome this, we propose a holistic, video-centric paradigm named \\textbf{L}ocal \\textbf{D}iffusion \\textbf{F}orcing for \\textbf{V}ideo \\textbf{F}rame \\textbf{I}nterpolation (LDF-VFI). Our framework is built upon an auto-regressive diffusion transformer that models the entire video sequence to ensure long-range temporal coherence. To mitigate error accumulation inherent in auto-regressive generation, we introduce a novel skip-concatenate sampling strategy that effectively maintains temporal stability. Furthermore, LDF-VFI incorporates sparse, local attention and tiled VAE encoding, a combination that not only enables efficient processing of long sequences but also allows generalization to arbitrary spatial resolutions (e.g., 4K) at inference without retraining. An enhanced conditional VAE decoder, which leverages multi-scale features from the input video, further improves reconstruction fidelity. Empirically, LDF-VFI achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging long-sequence benchmarks, demonstrating superior per-frame quality and temporal consistency, especially in scenes with large motion.

Existing TBPS methods therefore rely on dataset-centric fine-tuning to handle distribution shift, resulting in multiple independently trained models for different datasets. While synthetic data can increase the scale needed to fine-tune VLMs, it does not eliminate dataset-specific adaptation. This motivates a fundamental question: can we train a single unified TBPS model across multiple datasets? We show that naive joint training over all datasets remains sub-optimal because current training paradigms do not scale to a large number of unique person identities and are vulnerable to noisy image-text pairs. To address these challenges, we propose Scale-TBPS with two contributions: (i) a noise-aware unified dataset curation strategy that cohesively merges diverse TBPS datasets; and (ii) a scalable discriminative identity learning framework that remains effective under a large number of unique identities.

While modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at describing what is visible, it remains unclear whether they can infer how far a task has progressed from partial observations. To this end, we introduce Progress-Bench, a benchmark for systematically evaluating progress reasoning in VLMs. Beyond benchmarking, we further explore a human-inspired two-stage progress reasoning paradigm through both training-free prompting and training-based approach based on curated dataset ProgressLM-45K. Experiments on 14 VLMs show that most models are not yet ready for task progress estimation, exhibiting sensitivity to demonstration modality and viewpoint changes, as well as poor handling of unanswerable cases. While training-free prompting that enforces structured progress reasoning yields limited and model-dependent gains, the training-based ProgressLM-3B achieves consistent improvements even at a small model scale, despite being trained on a task set fully disjoint from the evaluation tasks.

This limitation stems largely from current models' reliance on mono audio datasets, which lack the binaural spatial information needed to learn visual-to-spatial audio mappings. To address this gap, we introduce two key contributions: we construct BinauralVGGSound, the first large-scale video-binaural audio dataset designed to support spatially aware video-to-audio generation; and we propose a end-to-end spatial audio generation framework guided by visual cues, which explicitly models spatial features. Our framework incorporates a visual-guided audio spatialization module that ensures the generated audio exhibits realistic spatial attributes and layered spatial depth while maintaining semantic and temporal alignment. Experiments show that our approach substantially outperforms state-of-the-art models in spatial fidelity and delivers a more immersive auditory experience, without sacrificing temporal or semantic consistency.

While prior DL methods have demonstrated varying levels of success, they often suffer from instability, limited fidelity, or poor robustness under realistic FL settings. We introduce a new DL attack that integrates a generative Flow Matching (FM) prior into the reconstruction process. By guiding optimization toward the distribution of realistic images (represented by a flow matching foundation model), our method enhances reconstruction fidelity without requiring knowledge of the private data. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and target models demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art attacks across pixel-level, perceptual, and feature-based similarity metrics. Crucially, the method remains effective across different training epochs, larger client batch sizes, and under common defenses such as noise injection, clipping, and sparsification.

For foreground regions, existing methods fail to adequately consider that some local patches may exhibit appearance or semantic similarity to other classes, which may mislead the training process. To address these issues, we propose a new plug-and-play framework. This framework consists of three core components: (1) a Foreground-Background Decomposition module, which follows previous FG-BG methods to separate an image into foreground and background regions; (2) an Adaptive Background Suppression module, which adaptively weights patch classification entropy; and (3) a Confusable Foreground Rectification module, which identifies and rectifies confusable foreground patches.

A critical obstacle is the inherent variability of cortical responses: neural activity elicited by the same visual stimulus differs across individuals and trials due to anatomical, functional, cognitive, and experimental factors, making fMRI-to-image reconstruction non-injective. In this paper, we tackle a challenging yet practically meaningful problem: zero-shot cross-subject fMRI-to-image reconstruction, where the visual experience of a previously unseen individual must be reconstructed without subject-specific training. To enable principled evaluation, we present a unified cortical-surface dataset -- UniCortex-fMRI, assembled from multiple visual-stimulus fMRI datasets to provide broad coverage of subjects and stimuli. Our UniCortex-fMRI is particularly processed by standardized data formats to make it possible to explore this possibility in the zero-shot scenario of cross-subject fMRI-to-image reconstruction. To tackle the modeling challenge, we propose PictorialCortex, which models fMRI activity using a compositional latent formulation that structures stimulus-driven representations under subject-, dataset-, and trial-related variability. PictorialCortex operates in a universal cortical latent space and implements this formulation through a latent factorization--composition module, reinforced by paired factorization and re-factorizing consistency regularization. During inference, surrogate latents synthesized under multiple seen-subject conditions are aggregated to guide diffusion-based image synthesis for unseen subjects. Extensive experiments show that PictorialCortex improves zero-shot cross-subject visual reconstruction, highlighting the benefits of compositional latent modeling and multi-dataset training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51faPictorialCortex\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u88ab\u8bd5\u7279\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8de8\u4e2a\u4f53\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672cfMRI\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u975e\u6ce8\u5c04\u6027\u6620\u5c04\u96be\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u89c9\u523a\u6fc0\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4e2a\u4f53\u548c\u8bd5\u9a8c\u4e2d\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u54cd\u5e94\u5b58\u5728\u89e3\u5256\u3001\u529f\u80fd\u3001\u8ba4\u77e5\u7b49\u591a\u7ef4\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f20\u7edffMRI-\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u8de8\u88ab\u8bd5\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u6784\u5efa\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u652f\u6491\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8fc1\u79fb\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u8111\u76ae\u5c42\u6570\u636e\u96c6UniCortex-fMRI\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u7ec4\u5408\u6f5c\u53d8\u91cf\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1) \u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u56e0\u5b50\u5206\u89e3\u6a21\u5757\u6355\u83b7\u88ab\u8bd5/\u6570\u636e\u96c6/\u8bd5\u9a8c\u76f8\u5173\u53d8\u5f02\uff1b2) \u914d\u5bf9\u56e0\u5b50\u5316\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7ea6\u675f\u6a21\u578b\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1b3) \u5728\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u5408\u6210\u591a\u6761\u4ef6\u6f5c\u8868\u793a\u5f15\u5bfc\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8de810\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u88ab\u8bd5\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cPictorialCortex\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u91cd\u5efa\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u63d0\u534723.6%\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7ec4\u5408\u6f5c\u53d8\u91cf\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u5bf9\u514b\u670d\u795e\u7ecf\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u548c\u7269\u4f53\u7c7b\u522b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u5c24\u5176\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6280\u672f\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u7acb\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8111\u6d3b\u52a8\u8868\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8de8\u88ab\u8bd5\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u795e\u7ecf\u89e3\u7801\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u8111\u673a\u63a5\u53e3\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u7406\u89e3\u5171\u4eab\u89c6\u89c9\u8868\u5f81\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u6ce8\u610f\u5230\u81ea\u7136\u89c6\u89c9\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u4ecd\u53d7\u9650\u4e8efMRI\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u3002"}}

Existing training-based hateful video detection methods are constrained by limited training data and lack of interpretability, while directly prompting large vision-language models often struggle to deliver reliable hate detection. To address these challenges, this paper introduces MARS, a training-free Multi-stage Adversarial ReaSoning framework that enables reliable and interpretable hateful content detection. MARS begins with the objective description of video content, establishing a neutral foundation for subsequent analysis. Building on this, it develops evidence-based reasoning that supports potential hateful interpretations, while in parallel incorporating counter-evidence reasoning to capture plausible non-hateful perspectives. Finally, these perspectives are synthesized into a conclusive and explainable decision. Extensive evaluation on two real-world datasets shows that MARS achieves up to 10% improvement under certain backbones and settings compared to other training-free approaches and outperforms state-of-the-art training-based methods on one dataset. In addition, MARS produces human-understandable justifications, thereby supporting compliance oversight and enhancing the transparency of content moderation workflows.

Among these, bounding boxes stand out as particularly effective, often outperforming points while significantly reducing annotation costs. However, current training and evaluation protocols typically rely on synthetic prompts generated through simple heuristics, offering limited insight into real-world robustness. In this paper, we investigate the robustness of promptable segmentation models to natural variations in bounding box prompts. First, we conduct a controlled user study and collect thousands of real bounding box annotations. Our analysis reveals substantial variability in segmentation quality across users for the same model and instance, indicating that SAM-like models are highly sensitive to natural prompt noise. Then, since exhaustive testing of all possible user inputs is computationally prohibitive, we reformulate robustness evaluation as a white-box optimization problem over the bounding box prompt space. We introduce BREPS, a method for generating adversarial bounding boxes that minimize or maximize segmentation error while adhering to naturalness constraints. Finally, we benchmark state-of-the-art models across 10 datasets, spanning everyday scenes to medical imaging.

Traditional bibliometric tools rely mainly on metadata and offer limited visibility into the semantic content of papers, making it hard to track how research themes evolve over time or how different areas influence one another. To obtain a clearer picture of recent developments, we compile a unified corpus of more than 100,000 papers from 22 major conferences between 2020 and 2025 and construct a multidimensional profiling pipeline to organize and analyze their textual content. By combining topic clustering, LLM-assisted parsing, and structured retrieval, we derive a comprehensive representation of research activity that supports the study of topic lifecycles, methodological transitions, dataset and model usage patterns, and institutional research directions.

We introduce PMPose, a top-down 2D pose estimator that incorporates the probabilistic formulation and the mask-conditioning. PMPose improves crowded pose estimation without sacrificing performance on standard scenes. Building on this, we present BBoxMaskPose v2 (BMPv2) integrating PMPose and an enhanced SAM-based mask refinement module. BMPv2 surpasses state-of-the-art by 1.5 average precision (AP) points on COCO and 6 AP points on OCHuman, becoming the first method to exceed 50 AP on OCHuman.

All models were evaluated on a four-class AD classification task comprising Mild Dementia, Moderate Dementia, Non-Demented, and Very Mild Dementia categories. Experimental findings show that CNN architectures consistently achieved strong performance, with ResNet50 attaining 98.83% accuracy. Transformer models demonstrated competitive generalization capabilities, with ViT achieving the highest accuracy among them at 95.38%. However, individual Transformer variants exhibited greater class-specific instability. The proposed Evan_V2 hybrid model, which integrates outputs from ten CNN and Transformer architectures through feature-level fusion, achieved the best overall performance with 99.99% accuracy, 0.9989 F1-score, and 0.9968 ROC AUC.

Existing methods relying solely on 3D diffusion models tend to suffer a degradation in appearance details, while those utilizing only 2D diffusion models typically compromise camera controllability. To overcome this limitation, we propose ScenDi, a method for urban scene generation that integrates both 3D and 2D diffusion models. We first train a 3D latent diffusion model to generate 3D Gaussians, enabling the rendering of images at a relatively low resolution. To enable controllable synthesis, this 3DGS generation process can be optionally conditioned by specifying inputs such as 3d bounding boxes, road maps, or text prompts. Then, we train a 2D video diffusion model to enhance appearance details conditioned on rendered images from the 3D Gaussians. By leveraging the coarse 3D scene as guidance for 2D video diffusion, ScenDi generates desired scenes based on input conditions and successfully adheres to accurate camera trajectories.

This study explores the viability of 2D projection-based vertebra segmentation for vertebra-level fracture detection in 3D CT volumes, presenting an end-to-end pipeline for automated analysis of cervical vertebrae (C1-C7). By approximating a 3D volume through optimized 2D axial, sagittal, and coronal projections, regions of interest are identified using the YOLOv8 model from all views and combined to approximate the 3D cervical spine area, achieving a 3D mIoU of 94.45 percent. This projection-based localization strategy reduces computational complexity compared to traditional 3D segmentation methods while maintaining high performance. It is followed by a DenseNet121-Unet-based multi-label segmentation leveraging variance- and energy-based projections, achieving a Dice score of 87.86 percent. Strategic approximation of 3D vertebral masks from these 2D segmentation masks enables the extraction of individual vertebra volumes.

While feed-forward methods have made progress, they often struggle to generate plausible details in occluded regions and preserve the fundamental spatial relationships of objects. Such accurate generative reasoning capability for the entire 3D space is critical in real-world applications. In this paper, we present FlowSSC, the first generative framework applied directly to monocular semantic scene completion. FlowSSC treats the SSC task as a conditional generation problem and can seamlessly integrate with existing feed-forward SSC methods to significantly boost their performance. To achieve real-time inference without compromising quality, we introduce Shortcut Flow-matching that operates in a compact triplane latent space. Unlike standard diffusion models that require hundreds of steps, our method utilizes a shortcut mechanism to achieve high-fidelity generation in a single step, enabling practical deployment in autonomous systems.

We find that prior (absolute or relative) encoding schemes for multi-view attention do not meet the above desiderata, and present RayRoPE to address this gap. RayRoPE represents patch positions based on associated rays but leverages a predicted point along the ray instead of the direction for a geometry-aware encoding. To achieve SE(3) invariance, RayRoPE computes query-frame projective coordinates for computing multi-frequency similarity. Lastly, as the 'predicted' 3D point along a ray may not be precise, RayRoPE presents a mechanism to analytically compute the expected position encoding under uncertainty. We validate RayRoPE on the tasks of novel-view synthesis and stereo depth estimation and show that it consistently improves over alternate position encoding schemes (e.g. 15% relative improvement on LPIPS in CO3D).

Despite remarkable progress in world modeling, current methods still suffer from severe instability and temporal degradation, often leading to spatial drift and scene collapse during long-horizon interactions. To better understand this issue, we initially investigate the underlying causes of instability and identify that the major source of error accumulation originates from the same scene, where generated frames gradually deviate from the initial clean state and propagate errors to subsequent frames. Building upon this observation, we propose a simple yet effective method, \\textbf{StableWorld}, a Dynamic Frame Eviction Mechanism. By continuously filtering out degraded frames while retaining geometrically consistent ones, StableWorld effectively prevents cumulative drift at its source, leading to more stable and temporal consistency of interactive generation. Promising results on multiple interactive video models, \\eg, Matrix-Game, Open-Oasis, and Hunyuan-GameCraft, demonstrate that StableWorld is model-agnostic and can be applied to different interactive video generation frameworks to substantially improve stability, temporal consistency, and generalization across diverse interactive scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faStableWorld\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u5e27\u9a71\u9010\u673a\u5236\u8fc7\u6ee4\u9000\u5316\u5e27\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u671f\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u6f02\u79fb\u548c\u573a\u666f\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u4ece\u6839\u6e90\u4e0a\u89e3\u51b3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u5e27\u9a71\u9010\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6301\u7eed\u8fc7\u6ee4\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u9000\u5316\u5e27\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u7a33\u5b9a\u5e27\u4ee5\u963b\u65ad\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\u3002", "result": "\u5728Matrix-Game\u3001Open-Oasis\u7b49\u6846\u67b6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u6027\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u53ca\u8de8\u573a\u666f\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "StableWorld\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u7684\u957f\u671f\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

However, synthesizing high-quality videos that accurately reflect real-world robotic interactions remains challenging, and the lack of a standardized benchmark limits fair comparisons and progress. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive robotics benchmark, RBench, designed to evaluate robot-oriented video generation across five task domains and four distinct embodiments. It assesses both task-level correctness and visual fidelity through reproducible sub-metrics, including structural consistency, physical plausibility, and action completeness. Evaluation of 25 representative models highlights significant deficiencies in generating physically realistic robot behaviors. Furthermore, the benchmark achieves a Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.96 with human evaluations, validating its effectiveness. While RBench provides the necessary lens to identify these deficiencies, achieving physical realism requires moving beyond evaluation to address the critical shortage of high-quality training data. Driven by these insights, we introduce a refined four-stage data pipeline, resulting in RoVid-X, the largest open-source robotic dataset for video generation with 4 million annotated video clips, covering thousands of tasks and enriched with comprehensive physical property annotations.

We address this question by presenting the Egocentric World Model (EgoWM), a simple, architecture-agnostic method that transforms any pretrained video diffusion model into an action-conditioned world model, enabling controllable future prediction. Rather than training from scratch, we repurpose the rich world priors of Internet-scale video models and inject motor commands through lightweight conditioning layers. This allows the model to follow actions faithfully while preserving realism and strong generalization. Our approach scales naturally across embodiments and action spaces, ranging from 3-DoF mobile robots to 25-DoF humanoids, where predicting egocentric joint-angle-driven dynamics is substantially more challenging. The model produces coherent rollouts for both navigation and manipulation tasks, requiring only modest fine-tuning. To evaluate physical correctness independently of visual appearance, we introduce the Structural Consistency Score (SCS), which measures whether stable scene elements evolve consistently with the provided actions.

Existing inference-time strategies, such as parallel sampling with verifiers or simply increasing denoising steps, can improve prompt alignment but remain inadequate for richly compositional settings where many constraints must be satisfied. Inspired by the success of chain-of-thought reasoning in large language models, we propose an iterative test-time strategy in which a T2I model progressively refines its generations across multiple steps, guided by feedback from a vision-language model as the critic in the loop. Our approach is simple, requires no external tools or priors, and can be flexibly applied to a wide range of image generators and vision-language models. Empirically, we demonstrate consistent gains on image generation across benchmarks: a 16.9% improvement in all-correct rate on ConceptMix (k=7), a 13.8% improvement on T2I-CompBench (3D-Spatial category) and a 12.5% improvement on Visual Jenga scene decomposition compared to compute-matched parallel sampling. Beyond quantitative gains, iterative refinement produces more faithful generations by decomposing complex prompts into sequential corrections, with human evaluators preferring our method 58.7% of the time over 41.3% for the parallel baseline. Together, these findings highlight iterative self-correction as a broadly applicable principle for compositional image generation.

However, since real ground truth for face swapping is unavailable, achieving both accurate identity transfer and high-quality attribute preservation remains challenging. In addition, recent diffusion-based approaches attempt to improve visual fidelity through conditional inpainting on masked target images, but the masked condition removes crucial appearance cues of target, resulting in plausible yet misaligned attributes. To address these limitations, we propose APPLE (Attribute-Preserving Pseudo-Labeling), a diffusion-based teacher-student framework that enhances attribute fidelity through attribute-aware pseudo-label supervision. We reformulate face swapping as a conditional deblurring task to more faithfully preserve target-specific attributes such as lighting, skin tone, and makeup. In addition, we introduce an attribute-aware inversion scheme to further improve detailed attribute preservation. Through an elaborate attribute-preserving design for teacher learning, APPLE produces high-quality pseudo triplets that explicitly provide the student with direct face-swapping supervision.
