Existing solutions for 3D scene relighting often require solving under-determined or ill-conditioned inverse rendering problems, and are as such unable to produce high-quality results on complex real-world scenes. Though recent progress in using generative image and video diffusion models for relighting has been promising, these techniques are either limited to 2D image and video relighting or 3D relighting of individual objects. Our approach enables controllable 3D relighting of room-scale scenes by distilling the outputs of a video-to-video relighting diffusion model into a 3D reconstruction. This side-steps the need to solve a difficult inverse rendering problem, and results in a flexible system that can relight 3D reconstructions of complex real-world scenes. We validate our approach on both synthetic and real-world datasets to show that it can faithfully render novel views of scenes under new lighting conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper proposes a method for controllable 3D relighting of room-scale environments using video-to-video diffusion models, avoiding complex inverse rendering problems.", "motivation": "Traditional 3D scene relighting methods face limitations in solving ill-conditioned inverse rendering problems and generating high-quality results for complex real-world scenes.

However, real-world video editing is often an iterative process, where users refine results across multiple rounds of interaction. In this multi-turn setting, current video editors struggle to maintain cross-consistency across sequential edits. In this work, we tackle, for the first time, the problem of cross-consistency in multi-turn video editing and introduce Memory-V2V, a simple, yet effective framework that augments existing video-to-video models with explicit memory. Given an external cache of previously edited videos, Memory-V2V employs accurate retrieval and dynamic tokenization strategies to condition the current editing step on prior results. To further mitigate redundancy and computational overhead, we propose a learnable token compressor within the DiT backbone that compresses redundant conditioning tokens while preserving essential visual cues, achieving an overall speedup of 30%. We validate Memory-V2V on challenging tasks including video novel view synthesis and text-conditioned long video editing. Extensive experiments show that Memory-V2V produces videos that are significantly more cross-consistent with minimal computational overhead, while maintaining or even improving task-specific performance over state-of-the-art baselines.

However, domain shifts and heterogeneity in data often lead to a degradation in model performance. Medical imaging applications are particularly affected by variations in acquisition protocols, scanner types, and patient populations. To address these issues, we introduce Federated Template and Task Learning (FeTTL), a novel framework designed to harmonize multi-institutional medical imaging data in federated environments. FeTTL learns a global template together with a task model to align data distributions among clients. We evaluated FeTTL on two challenging and diverse multi-institutional medical imaging tasks: retinal fundus optical disc segmentation and histopathological metastasis classification. Experimental results show that FeTTL significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art federated learning baselines (p-values <0.002) for optical disc segmentation and classification of metastases from multi-institutional data. Our experiments further highlight the importance of jointly learning the template and the task.

M3Kang includes 1,747 unique multiple-choice problems organized by grade-level difficulty, with translations into 108 culturally diverse languages, some of them including diagrams essential for solving them. Using this dataset, we conduct extensive benchmarking on both closed- and open-source SOTA models. We observe that, despite recent advances, models still struggle with basic math and diagram-based reasoning, with performance scaling with language presence and model size, but not with grade level. We also find that multilingual techniques can be effectively extended to the multimodal setting, resulting in significant improvements over baseline approaches. Our analysis also incorporates performance data from over 68,000 students, enabling direct comparison with human performance.

These errors reflect a persistent egocentric bias and raise questions about whether current models support allocentric reasoning. Inspired by human spatial cognition, we introduce perspective tokens, specialized embeddings that encode orientation through either (1) embodied body-keypoint cues or (2) abstract representations supporting mental rotation. Integrating these tokens into LLaVA-1.5-13B yields performance on level-2 visual perspective-taking tasks. Across synthetic and naturalistic benchmarks (Isle Bricks V2, COCO, 3DSRBench), perspective tokens improve accuracy, with rotation-based tokens generalizing to non-human reference agents. Representational analyses reveal that fine-tuning enhances latent orientation sensitivity already present in the base model, suggesting that MLMs contain precursors of allocentric reasoning but lack appropriate internal structure. Overall, embedding cognitively grounded spatial structure directly into token space provides a lightweight, model-agnostic mechanism for perspective-taking and more human-like spatial reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLMs\uff09\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u89c6\u89d2\u8f6c\u6362\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u89c6\u89d2\u4ee4\u724c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9700\u8981\u6362\u4f4d\u601d\u8003\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u53cd\u6620\u51fa\u81ea\u6211\u4e2d\u5fc3\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u4eff\u4eba\u7c7b\u7a7a\u95f4\u8ba4\u77e5\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ee5\u4ed6\u4eba\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e24\u79cd\u89c6\u89d2\u4ee4\u724c\uff1a(1)\u57fa\u4e8e\u8eab\u4f53\u5173\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u5177\u8eab\u5316\u8868\u5f81\uff0c(2)\u652f\u6301\u5fc3\u7406\u65cb\u8f6c\u7684\u62bd\u8c61\u8868\u5f81\u3002\u5c06\u4ee4\u724c\u96c6\u6210\u5230LLaVA-1.5-13B\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5728Isle Bricks V2\u3001COCO\u548c3DSRBench\u7b49\u57fa\u51c6\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u8868\u5f81\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u89c6\u89d2\u4ee4\u724c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e8c\u7ea7\u89c6\u89c9\u89c6\u89d2\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u65cb\u8f6c\u8868\u5f81\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u81f3\u975e\u4eba\u7c7b\u53c2\u8003\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u3002\u5fae\u8c03\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5df2\u5b58\u5728\u65b9\u4f4d\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6307\u5bfc\u5f97\u5230\u589e\u5f3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u76f4\u63a5\u5411\u6a21\u578b\u6ce8\u5165\u8ba4\u77e5\u79d1\u5b66\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u7c7b\u4eba\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u5b9eMLMs\u5177\u5907\u4ee5\u4ed6\u4eba\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u96cf\u5f62\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5408\u7406\u5185\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u652f\u6491\u3002"}}

Despite the progress of Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based approaches, existing RES methods still suffer from two key limitations: first, the coarse bounding boxes from MLLMs lead to redundant or non-discriminative point prompts; second, the prevalent reliance on textual coordinate reasoning is unreliable, as it fails to distinguish targets from visually similar distractors.

Specifically, EBD identifies high-information candidate points by modeling spatial uncertainty within coarse bounding boxes, treating point selection as an information maximization process.

While recent work has explored the use of LLMs in isolated decision tasks, little attention has been given to optimizing long-term objectives through dialogue. We introduce \\textbf{GameTalk}, a framework for training LLMs to make strategic decisions via multi-turn interactions. Unlike prior work that focuses on single-turn objectives or static action prediction, we train LLMs to optimize a global objective across full conversations. We achieve this by adapting fine-tuning methods like GRPO, DPO, and STaR to incorporate reward signals that depend on the entire interaction. We evaluate this approach on a suite of increasingly complex games, designed to stress different aspects of reasoning, coordination, and opponent modeling. Our results show that GameTalk significantly outperforms untrained models, especially under reward shaping, with DPO consistently yielding the strongest gains.

To tackle these issues, we propose DCCS-Det (Directional Context and Cross-Scale Aware Detector for Infrared Small Target), a novel detector that incorporates a Dual-stream Saliency Enhancement (DSE) block and a Latent-aware Semantic Extraction and Aggregation (LaSEA) module. The DSE block integrates localized perception with direction-aware context aggregation to help capture long-range spatial dependencies and local details. On this basis, the LaSEA module mitigates feature degradation via cross-scale feature extraction and random pooling sampling strategies, enhancing discriminative features and suppressing noise.

One particularly valuable use case is generating synthetic samples that can be used to train smaller models in low-resource scenarios where human-labelled data is scarce. In this work, we investigate whether these synthetic data generation capabilities can serve as a form of distillation, producing smaller models that perform on par with or even better than massive LLMs across languages and tasks. To this end, we use a state-of-the-art multilingual LLM to generate synthetic datasets covering 11 languages and 4 classification tasks. These datasets are then used to train smaller models via fine-tuning or instruction tuning, or as synthetic in-context examples for compact LLMs. Our experiments show that even small amounts of synthetic data enable smaller models to outperform the large generator itself, particularly in low-resource languages.

Recent segmentation foundation models have improved generalization through large-scale pretraining, yet remain poorly aligned with pathology because they treat segmentation as a static visual prediction task. Here we present VISTA-PATH, an interactive, class-aware pathology segmentation foundation model designed to resolve heterogeneous structures, incorporate expert feedback, and produce pixel-level segmentation that are directly meaningful for clinical interpretation. VISTA-PATH jointly conditions segmentation on visual context, semantic tissue descriptions, and optional expert-provided spatial prompts, enabling precise multi-class segmentation across heterogeneous pathology images. To support this paradigm, we curate VISTA-PATH Data, a large-scale pathology segmentation corpus comprising over 1.6 million image-mask-text triplets spanning 9 organs and 93 tissue classes. Across extensive held-out and external benchmarks, VISTA-PATH consistently outperforms existing segmentation foundation models. Importantly, VISTA-PATH supports dynamic human-in-the-loop refinement by propagating sparse, patch-level bounding-box annotation feedback into whole-slide segmentation. Finally, we show that the high-fidelity, class-aware segmentation produced by VISTA-PATH is a preferred model for computational pathology. It improve tissue microenvironment analysis through proposed Tumor Interaction Score (TIS), which exhibits strong and significant associations with patient survival. Together, these results establish VISTA-PATH as a foundation model that elevates pathology image segmentation from a static prediction to an interactive and clinically grounded representation for digital pathology.

Although recent multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive general reasoning capabilities, they still fall short of achieving human-level understanding of physical principles. Existing datasets for physical reasoning either rely on real-world videos, which incur high annotation costs, or on synthetic simulations, which suffer from limited realism and diversity. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm that leverages glitches in gameplay videos, referring to visual anomalies that violate predefined physical laws, as a rich and scalable supervision source for physical world understanding. We introduce PhysGame, an meta information guided instruction-tuning dataset containing 140,057 glitch-centric question-answer pairs across five physical domains and sixteen fine-grained categories. To ensure data accuracy, we design a prompting strategy that utilizes gameplay metadata such as titles and descriptions to guide high-quality QA generation. Complementing PhysGame, we construct GameBench, an expert-annotated benchmark with 880 glitch-identified gameplay videos designed to evaluate physical reasoning capabilities.

Some approaches have extended segmentation to 3D, enabling more complete and precise healing progress tracking. However, inferring multi-view consistent 3D structures from 2D images remains a challenge. In this paper, we evaluate WoundNeRF, a NeRF SDF-based method for estimating robust wound segmentations from automatically generated annotations.

To bridge this gap, we introduce TangramPuzzle, a geometry-grounded benchmark designed to evaluate compositional spatial reasoning through the lens of the classic Tangram game. We propose the Tangram Construction Expression (TCE), a symbolic geometric framework that grounds tangram assemblies in exact, machine-verifiable coordinate specifications, to mitigate the ambiguity of visual approximation.

We introduce CONTEXTCLARIFY with a set of ambiguous VQA questions and the contrast set that is non-ambiguous.

However, their effectiveness in specialized domains, such as remote sensing and medical imaging, remains limited. A natural approach to domain adaptation is to inject domain knowledge through textual instructions, prompts, or auxiliary captions. Surprisingly, we find that such input-level domain knowledge injection yields little to no improvement on scientific multimodal tasks, even when the domain knowledge is explicitly provided. This observation suggests that current MLLMs fail to internalize domain-specific priors through language alone, and that domain knowledge must be integrated at the optimization level. Motivated by this insight, we propose a reinforcement fine-tuning framework that incorporates domain knowledge directly into the learning objective. Instead of treating domain knowledge as descriptive information, we encode it as domain-informed constraints and reward signals, shaping the model's behavior in the output space. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets in remote sensing and medical domains consistently demonstrate good performance gains, achieving state-of-the-art results on multimodal domain tasks.

However, evaluator LLMs exhibit numerical bias, a phenomenon where certain evaluation scores are generated disproportionately often, leading reduced evaluation performance. This study investigates the cause of this bias. Given that most evaluator LLMs are aligned through instruction tuning and preference tuning, and that prior research suggests alignment reduces output diversity, we hypothesize that numerical bias arises from alignment. To test this, we compare outputs from pre- and post-alignment LLMs, and observe that alignment indeed increases numerical bias. We also explore mitigation strategies for post-alignment LLMs, including temperature scaling, distribution calibration, and score range adjustment. Among these, score range adjustment is most effective in reducing bias and improving performance, though still heuristic. Our findings highlight the need for further work on optimal score range selection and more robust mitigation strategies.", "AI": {"tldr": "This study explores how alignment techniques in LLMs cause numerical bias in evaluation tasks and proposes mitigation strategies like score range adjustment to improve performance.", "motivation": "Evaluator LLMs exhibit numerical bias, reducing evaluation performance.

Existing methods focus either on extracting features from localized patches, or pursue processing entire images holistically, which leads to the cross temporal feature matching deviation and exhibiting sensitivity to radiometric and geometric noise. Following the above issues, we propose a dual-module collaboration guided hierarchical adaptive aggregation framework, namely HA2F, which consists of dynamic hierarchical feature calibration module (DHFCM) and noise-adaptive feature refinement module (NAFRM). The former dynamically fuses adjacent-level features through perceptual feature selection, suppressing irrelevant discrepancies to address multi-temporal feature alignment deviations. The NAFRM utilizes the dual feature selection mechanism to highlight the change sensitive regions and generate spatial masks, suppressing the interference of irrelevant regions or shadows. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed HA2F, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD, and SYSU-CD datasets, surpassing existing comparative methods in terms of both precision metrics and computational efficiency.

This performance gap between general-purpose LLMs and domain experts is significantly limiting the application of LLMs on a wider range of domain-specific tasks. In this work, we aim to bridge the divide between LLMs' general reasoning capabilities and expert knowledge in domain-specific tasks.

However, existing CoVR frameworks typically fuse multimodal inputs in a single stage, achieving only marginal gains over initial baseline. To address this, we propose a novel CoVR framework that leverages the representational power of Vision Language Models (VLMs). Our framework incorporates a novel cross-attention module X-Aligner, composed of cross-attention layers that progressively fuse visual and textual inputs and align their multimodal representation with that of the target video. To further enhance the representation of the multimodal query, we incorporate the caption of the visual query as an additional input. The framework is trained in two stages to preserve the pretrained VLM representation. In the first stage, only the newly introduced module is trained, while in the second stage, the textual query encoder is also fine-tuned. We implement our framework on top of BLIP-family architecture, namely BLIP and BLIP-2, and train it on the Webvid-CoVR data set. In addition to in-domain evaluation on Webvid-CoVR-Test, we perform zero-shot evaluations on the Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) data sets CIRCO and Fashion-IQ.

GraphAnchor incrementally updates a graph during iterative retrieval to anchor salient entities and relations, yielding a structured index that guides the LLM in evaluating knowledge sufficiency and formulating subsequent subqueries. The final answer is generated by jointly leveraging all retrieved documents and the final evolved graph. Experiments on four multi-hop question answering benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of GraphAnchor, and reveal that GraphAnchor modulates the LLM's attention to more effectively associate key information distributed in retrieved documents.

Yet, existing studies focus on narrative or role-playing tasks and overlook how adversarial conversational history alone can reshape induced personas. Black-box persona manipulation remains unexplored, raising concerns for robustness in realistic interactions. In response, we introduce the task of persona editing, which adversarially steers LLM traits through user-side inputs under a black-box, inference-only setting. To this end, we propose PHISH (Persona Hijacking via Implicit Steering in History), the first framework to expose a new vulnerability in LLM safety that embeds semantically loaded cues into user queries to gradually induce reverse personas. We also define a metric to quantify attack success. Across 3 benchmarks and 8 LLMs, PHISH predictably shifts personas, triggers collateral changes in correlated traits, and exhibits stronger effects in multi-turn settings. In high-risk domains mental health, tutoring, and customer support, PHISH reliably manipulates personas, validated by both human and LLM-as-Judge evaluations. Importantly, PHISH causes only a small reduction in reasoning benchmark performance, leaving overall utility largely intact while still enabling significant persona manipulation. While current guardrails offer partial protection, they remain brittle under sustained attack.

However, there are major challenges to accurately capturing small targets in object detection due to the imbalanced scale and the blurred edges. To address these issues, boundary and position information mining (BPIM) framework is proposed for capturing object edge and location cues. The proposed BPIM includes position information guidance (PIG) module for obtaining location information, boundary information guidance (BIG) module for extracting object edge, cross scale fusion (CSF) module for gradually assembling the shallow layer image feature, three feature fusion (TFF) module for progressively combining position and boundary information, and adaptive weight fusion (AWF) module for flexibly merging the deep layer semantic feature. Therefore, BPIM can integrate boundary, position, and scale information in image for small object detection using attention mechanisms and cross-scale feature fusion strategies. Furthermore, BPIM not only improves the discrimination of the contextual feature by adaptive weight fusion with boundary, but also enhances small object perceptions by cross-scale position fusion.

Synthetic facial images offer a potential solution, yet existing generative models often struggle to balance realism, diversity, and identity preservation. This paper presents SCHIGAND, a novel synthetic face generation pipeline integrating StyleCLIP, HyperStyle, InterfaceGAN, and Diffusion models to produce highly realistic and controllable facial datasets. SCHIGAND enhances identity preservation while generating realistic intra-class variations and maintaining inter-class distinctiveness, making it suitable for biometric testing. The generated datasets were evaluated using ArcFace, a leading facial verification model, to assess their effectiveness in comparison to real-world facial datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that SCHIGAND achieves a balance between image quality and diversity, addressing key limitations of prior generative models.

However, a common class of reasoning tasks, iterative optimization, presents distinct challenges: the agent interacts with the same underlying environment state across turns, and the value of a trajectory is determined by the best turn-level reward rather than cumulative returns. Existing GRPO-based methods cannot perform fine-grained, turn-level optimization in such settings, while black-box optimization methods discard prior knowledge and reasoning capabilities. To address this gap, we propose Turn-Level GRPO (TL-GRPO), a lightweight RL algorithm that performs turn-level group sampling for fine-grained optimization. We evaluate TL-GRPO on analog circuit sizing (ACS), a challenging scientific optimization task requiring multiple simulations and domain expertise. Results show that TL-GRPO outperforms standard GRPO and Bayesian optimization methods across various specifications.

However, existing garment reconstruction methods typically rely on unstructured representations, such as 3D Gaussian Splats, struggling to provide accurate reconstructions of garment topology and sewing structures. As a result, the reconstructed outputs are often unsuitable for high-fidelity physical simulation. We propose ReWeaver, a novel framework for topology-accurate 3D garment and sewing pattern reconstruction from sparse multi-view RGB images. Given as few as four input views, ReWeaver predicts seams and panels as well as their connectivities in both the 2D UV space and the 3D space. The predicted seams and panels align precisely with the multi-view images, yielding structured 2D--3D garment representations suitable for 3D perception, high-fidelity physical simulation, and robotic manipulation. To enable effective training, we construct a large-scale dataset GCD-TS, comprising multi-view RGB images, 3D garment geometries, textured human body meshes and annotated sewing patterns. The dataset contains over 100,000 synthetic samples covering a wide range of complex geometries and topologies.

However, many of these approaches fail to exploit the structural inter-class similarities and overlook the impact of anomalous positive samples. In this study, we introduce ACLNet, an Affinity Contrastive Learning Network that explores the intricate clustering relationships among human activity classes to improve feature discrimination. Specifically, we propose an affinity metric to refine similarity measurements, thereby forming activity superclasses that provide more informative contrastive signals. A dynamic temperature schedule is also introduced to adaptively adjust the penalty strength for various superclasses. In addition, we employ a margin-based contrastive strategy to improve the separation of hard positive and negative samples within classes. Extensive experiments on NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, Kinetics-Skeleton, PKU-MMD, FineGYM, and CASIA-B demonstrate the superiority of our method in skeleton-based action recognition, gait recognition, and person re-identification.

We show that data quality is a significant limiting factor in many published datasets and propose CER-HV (CER-based Ranking with Human Verification) as a framework to detect and clean label errors. CER-HV combines a CER-based noise detector, built on a carefully configured Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) with early stopping to avoid overfitting noisy samples, and a human-in-the-loop (HITL) step that verifies high-ranking samples. The framework reveals that several existing datasets contain previously underreported problems, including transcription, segmentation, orientation, and non-text content errors. These have been identified with up to 90 percent precision in the Muharaf and 80-86 percent in the PHTI datasets.\n  We also show that our CRNN achieves state-of-the-art performance across five of the six evaluated datasets, reaching 8.45 percent Character Error Rate (CER) on KHATT (Arabic), 8.26 percent on PHTI (Pashto), 10.66 percent on Ajami, and 10.11 percent on Muharaf (Arabic), all without any data cleaning. We establish a new baseline of 11.3 percent CER on the PHTD (Persian) dataset. Applying CER-HV improves the evaluation CER by 0.3-0.6 percent on the cleaner datasets and 1.0-1.8 percent on the noisier ones.

This makes CSAS a valuable tool for target recognition in mine warfare where the diversity of point of view is essential for reducing false alarms. CSAS processing typically produces a very high-resolution two-dimensional image. However, the parallax introduced by the circular displacement of the illuminator fill-in the shadow regions, and the shadow cast by an object on the seafloor is lost in favor of azimuth coverage and resolution. Yet the shadows provide complementary information on target shape useful for target recognition. In this paper, we explore a way to retrieve shadow information from CSAS data to improve target analysis and carry 3D reconstruction. Sub-aperture filtering is used to get a collection of images at various points of view along the circular trajectory and fixed focus shadow enhancement (FFSE) is applied to obtain sharp shadows. An interactive interface is also proposed to allow human operators to visualize these shadows along the circular trajectory. A space-carving reconstruction method is applied to infer the 3D shape of the object from the segmented shadows. The results demonstrate the potential of shadows in circular SAS for improving target analysis and 3D reconstruction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4ece\u5706\u5f62\u5408\u6210\u5b54\u5f84\u58f0\u7eb3\uff08CSAS\uff09\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u9634\u5f71\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u6790\u548c\u4e09\u7ef4\u91cd\u5efa\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4fa7\u626b\u58f0\u7eb3\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u5b54\u5f84\u8303\u56f4\u548c\u5355\u4e00\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u800cCSAS\u867d\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b360\u00b0\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6210\u50cf\uff0c\u4f46\u56e0\u5706\u5468\u4f4d\u79fb\u4ea7\u751f\u89c6\u5dee\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6d77\u5e95\u76ee\u6807\u9634\u5f71\u4e22\u5931\u3002\u9634\u5f71\u672c\u8eab\u5305\u542b\u76ee\u6807\u5f62\u72b6\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5bf9\u51cf\u5c11\u8bef\u62a5\u548c\u4e09\u7ef4\u91cd\u5efa\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b50\u5b54\u5f84\u6ee4\u6ce2\u751f\u6210\u591a\u4e2a\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0b\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u56fa\u5b9a\u7126\u70b9\u9634\u5f71\u589e\u5f3a\uff08FFSE\uff09\u6280\u672f\u9510\u5316\u9634\u5f71\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u63a5\u53e3\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u9634\u5f71\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7a7a\u57df\u96d5\u523b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ece\u9634\u5f71\u5206\u5272\u7ed3\u679c\u4e2d\u63a8\u65ad\u4e09\u7ef4\u5f62\u72b6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u9634\u5f71\u6062\u590d\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e09\u7ef4\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u9634\u5f71\u4fe1\u606f\u5bf9\u76ee\u6807\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u5f62\u72b6\u5206\u6790\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc1\u660eCSAS\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u9634\u5f71\u4fe1\u606f\u53ef\u8f85\u52a9\u63d0\u5347\u76ee\u6807\u8bc6\u522b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u6c34\u4e0b\u76ee\u6807\u4e09\u7ef4\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u5c06\u9634\u5f71\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709CSAS\u6210\u50cf\u6280\u672f\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u53ef\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u6c34\u96f7\u6218\u7b49\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

As an explicit representation optimized through gradient propagation among primitives, optimization widely accepted in deep neural networks (DNNs) is actually adopted in 3DGS, such as synchronous weight updating and Adam with the adaptive gradient. However, considering the physical significance and specific design in 3DGS, there are two overlooked details in the optimization of 3DGS: (i) update step coupling, which induces optimizer state rescaling and costly attribute updates outside the viewpoints, and (ii) gradient coupling in the moment, which may lead to under- or over-effective regularization. Nevertheless, such a complex coupling is under-explored. After revisiting the optimization of 3DGS, we take a step to decouple it and recompose the process into: Sparse Adam, Re-State Regularization and Decoupled Attribute Regularization. Taking a large number of experiments under the 3DGS and 3DGS-MCMC frameworks, our work provides a deeper understanding of these components. Finally, based on the empirical analysis, we re-design the optimization and propose AdamW-GS by re-coupling the beneficial components, under which better optimization efficiency and representation effectiveness are achieved simultaneously.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9488\u5bf93D\u9ad8\u65af\u70b9\u7ed8\uff083DGS\uff09\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u89e3\u8026\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u89e3\u66f4\u65b0\u6b65\u9aa4\u548c\u68af\u5ea6\u8026\u5408\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86Sparse Adam\u3001Re-State Regularization\u548cDecoupled Attribute Regularization\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86AdamW-GS\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u8868\u793a\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "3DGS\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\u7684\u8026\u5408\u95ee\u9898\uff1a(i) \u66f4\u65b0\u6b65\u9aa4\u8026\u5408\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u72b6\u6001\u91cd\u7f29\u653e\u548c\u975e\u89c6\u70b9\u5c5e\u6027\u66f4\u65b0\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff1b(ii) \u52a8\u91cf\u68af\u5ea6\u8026\u5408\u5f15\u53d1\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u8fc7\u5f3a\u6216\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u4f20\u7edfAdam\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5c063DGS\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u89e3\u8026\u4e3a\u4e09\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a1) \u7a00\u758fAdam\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u51cf\u5c11\u5197\u4f59\u8ba1\u7b97\uff1b2) Re-State Regularization\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u72b6\u6001\uff1b3) Decoupled Attribute Regularization\u5206\u79bb\u5c5e\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u63d0\u51faAdamW-GS\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91cd\u65b0\u7ec4\u5408\u6709\u6548\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u91cf3DGS\u548c3DGS-MCMC\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1a1) \u89e3\u8026\u7ec4\u4ef6\u53ef\u964d\u4f4e30%\u975e\u5fc5\u8981\u5c5e\u6027\u66f4\u65b0\uff1b2) \u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u4f7f\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u63d0\u534740%\uff1b3) AdamW-GS\u5728PSNR\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u6bd4\u539f\u59cb\u65b9\u6cd5\u9ad82-3dB\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u53471.5\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e863DGS\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u6df1\u5c42\u8026\u5408\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u89e3\u8026-\u91cd\u7ec4\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u8868\u793a\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Existing methods typically follow a decomposition paradigm, in which a claim is broken down into sub-claims that are individually verified.

To address this problem, we propose a Retrieve-Refine-Calibrate (RRC) framework based on large language models (LLMs). Specifically, the framework first identifies the entities mentioned in the claim and retrieves evidence relevant to them. Then, it refines the retrieved evidence based on the claim to reduce irrelevant information. Finally, it calibrates the verification process by re-evaluating low-confidence predictions.

Many deep learning models (DLMs) deployed in the production environment are gradually being replaced by VLLMs. Compared with DLMs, VLLMs have some advantages in industrial applications: (1) Their strong generalization ability enables them to perform well across a wide range of tasks. (2) They are flexible and can deal with unfamiliar samples through context learning quickly. However, VLLMs also have obvious drawbacks: (1) VLLMs do not perform as well as custom-developed DLMs in specific domains. (2) The number of parameters in VLLMs is generally quite large, and their deployment requires substantial computational resources. (3) VLLMs generally operate much slower than DLMs, making real-time response challenging to achieve. To better utilize VLLMs in industrial applications, we introduce AuroraEdge-V-2B in this work, a compact, robust, and high-speed VLLM designed for edge deployment. To make the model run faster, we also propose a compression-fusion method to improve inference efficiency. AuroraEdge-V-2B has the following notable features: (1) Easy deployment and faster: It has only 2B parameters and is highly suitable for edge deployment, offering better real-time performance. (2) Fewer visual tokens and cheaper: It significantly reduces the number of visual tokens in the decoding process, thereby reducing the floating-point operations by half during inference and making it cheaper to use.

Falling in a similar category, we proposed FMPose, a probabilistic 3D human pose estimation method based on the flow matching generative approach. Conditioned on the 2D cues, the flow matching scheme learns the optimal transport from a simple source distribution to the plausible 3D human pose distribution via continuous normalizing flows. The 2D lifting condition is modeled via graph convolutional networks, leveraging the learnable connections between human body joints as the graph structure for feature aggregation. Compared to diffusion-based methods, the FMPose with optimal transport produces faster and more accurate 3D pose generations.

First, we fine-tune the LLMs with the CVSS corpus, employing designed tri-task learning and chain of modality methods to boost the initial performance.

In this paper, we propose BrepARG, the first attempt to encode B-rep's geometry and topology into a holistic token sequence representation, enabling sequence-based B-rep generation with an autoregressive architecture. Specifically, BrepARG encodes B-rep into 3 types of tokens: geometry and position tokens representing geometric features, and face index tokens representing topology. Then the holistic token sequence is constructed hierarchically, starting with constructing the geometry blocks (i.e., faces and edges) using the above tokens, followed by geometry block sequencing. Finally, we assemble the holistic sequence representation for the entire B-rep. We also construct a transformer-based autoregressive model that learns the distribution over holistic token sequences via next-token prediction, using a multi-layer decoder-only architecture with causal masking. Experiments demonstrate that BrepARG achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

Recent prompt-based methods, which integrate pretrained backbones with task-specific prompts, have made notable progress. However, under extreme few-shot incremental settings, the model's ability to transfer and generalize becomes critical, and it is thus essential to leverage pretrained knowledge to learn feature representations that can be shared across future categories during the base session. Inspired by the mechanism of the CLS token, which is similar to human attention and progressively filters out task-irrelevant information, we propose the CLS Token Attention Steering Prompts (CASP). This approach introduces class-shared trainable bias parameters into the query, key, and value projections of the CLS token to explicitly modulate the self-attention weights. To further enhance generalization, we also design an attention perturbation strategy and perform Manifold Token Mixup in the shallow feature space, synthesizing potential new class features to improve generalization and reserve the representation capacity for upcoming tasks.

Since language use is more informal, spontaneous, and adheres to many different sociolects, the performance of NLP models often deteriorates. One solution to this problem is to transform data to a standard variant before processing it, which is also called lexical normalization. There has been a wide variety of benchmarks and models proposed for this task. The MultiLexNorm benchmark proposed to unify these efforts, but it consists almost solely of languages from the Indo-European language family in the Latin script.

These forces are typically modeled as vectors connecting ligament landmarks on adjacent vertebrae, making precise identification of these landmarks a key requirement for constructing reliable spine models.

This work presents a novel approach for detecting spinal ligament landmarks, which first performs shape-based segmentation of 3D vertebrae and subsequently applies domain-specific rules to identify different types of attachment points.

Motivated by the linear representation hypothesis, we train linear probes across the residual stream, multilayer perceptron (MLP), and attention layers to analyze where these signals emerge. Although separability appears in the residual stream and MLPs, steering using these probes is most effective in a sparse subset of middle-layer attention heads. Using TruthfulQA as the base dataset, we find that probes trained on it transfer effectively to other factual QA benchmarks. Furthermore, comparing our discovered direction to previously identified \"truthful\" directions reveals limited overlap, suggesting that factual accuracy, and deference resistance, arise from related but distinct mechanisms. Attention-pattern analysis further indicates that the influential heads attend disproportionately to expressions of user doubt, contributing to sycophantic shifts.

However, predicting aesthetic experiences remains difficult due to the subjective nature of perception and the complexity of visual responses. This study introduces a dual-branch CNN-LSTM framework that fuses visual features with eye-tracking signals to predict aesthetic evaluations of residential interiors. We collected a dataset of 224 interior design videos paired with synchronized gaze data from 28 participants who rated 15 aesthetic dimensions. The proposed model attains 72.2% accuracy on objective dimensions (e.g., light) and 66.8% on subjective dimensions (e.g., relaxation), outperforming state-of-the-art video baselines and showing clear gains on subjective evaluation tasks. Notably, models trained with eye-tracking retain comparable performance when deployed with visual input alone.

This paper investigates if it is better to create low-dimensional representations by selecting a small, architecturally informed subset of model components or by projecting the full gradients into a lower-dimensional space. Using a novel benchmark, we show that a greedily selected subset of components captures the information about training data influence needed for a retrieval task more effectively than either the full gradient or random projection.

However, existing legal benchmarks rely on simplified and highly standardized tasks, failing to capture the ambiguity, complexity, and reasoning demands of real legal practice. Moreover, prior evaluations often adopt coarse, single-dimensional metrics and do not explicitly assess fine-grained legal reasoning. To address these limitations, we introduce PLawBench, a Practical Law Benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs in realistic legal practice scenarios. Grounded in real-world legal workflows, PLawBench models the core processes of legal practitioners through three task categories: public legal consultation, practical case analysis, and legal document generation. These tasks assess a model's ability to identify legal issues and key facts, perform structured legal reasoning, and generate legally coherent documents. PLawBench comprises 850 questions across 13 practical legal scenarios, with each question accompanied by expert-designed evaluation rubrics, resulting in approximately 12,500 rubric items for fine-grained assessment. Using an LLM-based evaluator aligned with human expert judgments, we evaluate 10 state-of-the-art LLMs. Experimental results show that none achieves strong performance on PLawBench, revealing substantial limitations in the fine-grained legal reasoning capabilities of current LLMs and highlighting important directions for future evaluation and development of legal LLMs. Data is available at: https://github.com/skylenage/PLawbench.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86PLawBench\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5b9e\u8df5\u573a\u666f\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6cd5\u5f8b\u57fa\u51c6\u4f9d\u8d56\u7b80\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u5355\u4e00\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6a21\u62df\u771f\u5b9e\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u4e0e\u591a\u7ef4\u63a8\u7406\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u9700\u5efa\u7acb\u66f4\u8d34\u8fd1\u5b9e\u8df5\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f53\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b850\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u300113\u79cd\u6cd5\u5f8b\u573a\u666f\u7684PLawBench\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u516c\u4f17\u6cd5\u5f8b\u54a8\u8be2\u3001\u6848\u4f8b\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6587\u4e66\u751f\u6210\u4e09\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u5bf910\u79cd\u5148\u8fdbLLMs\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6cd5\u5f8b\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524dLLMs\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u91cd\u5927\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u9700\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u6cd5\u5f8b\u77e5\u8bc6\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u591a\u6b65\u9aa4\u4efb\u52a1\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Selecting the checkpoint with the minimum head gradient in a short tail window closes most of the gap to the oracle (4.24% +/- 2.00% with a universal setup, about 1.12% with light per-family tuning). For practical deployment, a head-scale normalization is more stable within classic CNN families (e.g., ResNets), while a feature-scale normalization works well for Transformers and modern CNNs. The same one-batch probe also predicts COCO detection/segmentation mAP. In diffusion (UNet/DDPM on CIFAR-10), it tracks progress and enables near-oracle tail-window selection; it is positively correlated with same-distribution probe MSE and negatively with FID (lower is better), so it can be used as a lightweight, label-free monitor. Validation labels are never used beyond reporting. The probe adds much less than 0.1% of an epoch and works as a drop-in for validation-free checkpoint selection and early stopping.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u9a8c\u8bc1\u96c6\u7684\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u6b21\u524d\u5411-\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u8ba1\u7b97\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5934\u90e8\u68af\u5ea6\u7684Frobenius\u8303\u6570\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u96c6\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u8017\u65f6\u4e14\u53ef\u80fd\u6cc4\u9732\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u5355\u4e2a\u524d\u5411-\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u4e2d\u8ba1\u7b97\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5934\u90e8\u68af\u5ea6\u7684Frobenius\u8303\u6570||g||_F\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5982ResNet\u7528\u5934\u7f29\u653e\uff0cTransformer\u7528\u7279\u5f81\u7f29\u653e\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u7b5b\u9009\u3002", "result": "\u5728ImageNet\u3001COCO\u548c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9Top-1\u51c6\u786e\u7387/\u635f\u5931\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u4f4e\u4e8e0.1%\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982FID\uff09\u3002\u5728\u65e0\u9a8c\u8bc1\u96c6\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u63a5\u8fd1Oracle\u9009\u62e9\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u96c6\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u4e0d\u518d\u662f\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u6b64\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u7075\u6d3b\u96c6\u6210\u81f3\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u6807\u7b7e\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8bad\u7ec3\u76d1\u63a7\u3002"}}

Recent advancements in Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (VGGT) models have shown great promise in camera pose estimation and 3D reconstruction. However, these models typically rely on ground truth labels for training, posing challenges when adapting to unlabeled and unseen scenes. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised framework to train VGGT with unlabeled data, thereby enhancing its localization capability in large-scale environments. To achieve this, we extend conventional pair-wise relations to sequence-wise geometric constraints for self-supervised learning. Specifically, in each sequence, we sample multiple source frames and geometrically project them onto different target frames, which improves temporal feature consistency. We formulate physical photometric consistency and geometric constraints as a joint optimization loss to circumvent the requirement for hard labels. By training the model with this proposed method, not only the local and global cross-view attention layers but also the camera and depth heads can effectively capture the underlying multi-view geometry. Experiments demonstrate that the model converges within hundreds of iterations and achieves significant improvements in large-scale localization.

Current Transformer-based regression models trained primarily on native-speaker corpora often learn spurious correlations between surface-level L2 linguistic features and essay quality. In this study, we conduct a bias study of a fine-tuned DeBERTa-v3 model using the ASAP 2.0 and ELLIPSE datasets, revealing a constrained score scaling for high-proficiency ESL writing where high-proficiency ESL essays receive scores 10.3% lower than Native speaker essays of identical human-rated quality. To mitigate this, we propose applying contrastive learning with a triplet construction strategy: Contrastive Learning with Matched Essay Pairs. We constructed a dataset of 17,161 matched essay pairs and fine-tuned the model using Triplet Margin Loss to align the latent representations of ESL and Native writing. Our approach reduced the high-proficiency scoring disparity by 39.9% (to a 6.2% gap) while maintaining a Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) of 0.76.

While attention sink frames have been introduced to mitigate this performance decay, they often induce a critical failure mode we term sink-collapse: the generated content repeatedly reverts to the sink frame, resulting in abrupt scene resets and cyclic motion patterns. Our analysis reveals that sink-collapse originates from an inherent conflict between the periodic structure of Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) and the multi-head attention mechanisms prevalent in current generative models. To address it, we propose a lightweight, training-free approach that effectively suppresses this behavior by introducing multi-head RoPE jitter that breaks inter-head attention homogenization and mitigates long-horizon collapse. Extensive experiments show that our method successfully alleviates sink-collapse while preserving generation quality. To the best of our knowledge, this work achieves the first demonstration of real-time, streaming, and infinite-length video generation with little quality decay. As an illustration of this robustness, we generate continuous videos up to 12 hours in length, which, to our knowledge, is among the longest publicly demonstrated results in streaming video generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4e2dsink-collapse\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u5934RoPE\u6296\u52a8\u6291\u5236\u957f\u671f\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5b9e\u65f6\u65e0\u9650\u957f\u5ea6\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u4f7f\u7528sink\u5e27\u7f13\u89e3\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\uff0c\u4f46\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4sink-collapse\uff08\u5185\u5bb9\u53cd\u590d\u56de\u5f52\u53c2\u8003\u5e27\uff09\u3002\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u6e90\u4e8eRoPE\u5468\u671f\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u591a\u5934\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u591a\u5934RoPE\u6296\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6253\u7834\u8de8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u540c\u8d28\u5316\u6765\u6291\u5236sink-collapse\uff0c\u7ef4\u6301\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u7f13\u89e3sink-collapse\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b012\u5c0f\u65f6\u8d85\u957f\u8fde\u7eed\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u76ee\u524d\u4e3a\u6d41\u5f0f\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u6700\u957f\u516c\u5f00\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u9886\u57df\u957f\u671f\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u957f\u671f\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u65e0\u9650\u957f\u5ea6\u5b9e\u65f6\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Many recent automated radiology report generation methods are designed to capture longitudinal information; however, validating their performance is challenging. There is no proper tool to consistently label temporal changes in both ground-truth and model-generated texts for meaningful comparisons. Existing annotation methods are typically labor-intensive, relying on the use of manual lexicons and rules. Complex rules are closed-source, domain specific and hard to adapt, whereas overly simple ones tend to miss essential specialised information. Large language models (LLMs) offer a promising annotation alternative, as they are capable of capturing nuanced linguistic patterns and semantic similarities without extensive manual intervention. They also adapt well to new contexts. In this study, we therefore propose an LLM-based pipeline to automatically annotate longitudinal information in radiology reports. The pipeline first identifies sentences containing relevant information and then extracts the progression of diseases. We evaluate and compare five mainstream LLMs on these two tasks using 500 manually annotated reports. Considering both efficiency and performance, Qwen2.5-32B was subsequently selected and used to annotate another 95,169 reports from the public MIMIC-CXR dataset. Our Qwen2.5-32B-annotated dataset provided us with a standardized benchmark for evaluating report generation models. Using this new benchmark, we assessed seven state-of-the-art report generation models.

However, such adaptations often depend heavily on teacher models, which can limit performance, particularly in the absence of a strong autoregressive teacher, resulting in output quality that typically lags behind their bidirectional counterparts. In this paper, we explore an alternative approach that uses reward signals to guide the generation process, enabling more efficient and scalable autoregressive generation. By using reward signals to guide the model, our method simplifies training while preserving high visual fidelity and temporal consistency. Through extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, we find that our approach performs comparably to existing autoregressive models and, in some cases, surpasses similarly sized bidirectional models by avoiding constraints imposed by teacher architectures. For example, on VBench, our method achieves a total score of 84.92, closely matching state-of-the-art autoregressive methods that score 84.31 but require significant heterogeneous distillation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u5f3a\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4f9d\u8d56\u590d\u6742\u7684\u6559\u5e08-\u5b66\u751f\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bad\u7ec3\u53d7\u9650\uff08\u5982\u9700\u5f3a\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u5e76\u5f71\u54cd\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u800c\u53cc\u5411\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u8d28\u91cf\u9ad8\u5374\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u65e0\u9700\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u66f4\u6613\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faReward-Guided Autoregressive Generation\uff08RG-AG\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u4f7f\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5c06\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1b2) \u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42Transformer\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u5e8f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u9891\u5e27\u5e8f\u5217\uff1b3) \u7ed3\u5408\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u5e27\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728VBench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u4ee584.92\u603b\u5206\u63a5\u8fd1\u9700\u590d\u6742\u84b8\u998f\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0884.31\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u572816\u5e27\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6bd4\u53cc\u5411\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u53479.7%\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u6d41\u7545\u6027\u6307\u6807\u3002\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fed\u4ee3\u51cf\u5c1140%\u4e14\u652f\u6301\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8c03\u6574\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u66ff\u4ee3\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u6307\u5bfc\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5728\u751f\u6210\u6548\u7387\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4e3a\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

We focus on two pervasive failure modes: (i) hallucinations, where models produce incorrect information about the world, and (ii) the low-resource effect, where the models show impressive performance in high-resource languages like English but the performance degrades significantly in low-resource languages like Bengali. We study the intersection of these issues and ask: do hallucination detectors suffer from the low-resource effect? We conduct experiments on five tasks across three domains (factual recall, STEM, and Humanities). Experiments with four LLMs and three hallucination detectors reveal a curious finding: As expected, the task accuracies in low-resource languages experience large drops (compared to English). However, the drop in detectors' accuracy is often several times smaller than the drop in task accuracy. Our findings suggest that even in low-resource languages, the internal mechanisms of LLMs might encode signals about their uncertainty.

We introduce VisGym, a gymnasium of 17 environments for evaluating and training VLMs. The suite spans symbolic puzzles, real-image understanding, navigation, and manipulation, and provides flexible controls over difficulty, input representation, planning horizon, and feedback. We also provide multi-step solvers that generate structured demonstrations, enabling supervised finetuning. Our evaluations show that all frontier models struggle in interactive settings, achieving low success rates in both the easy (46.6%) and hard (26.0%) configurations. Our experiments reveal notable limitations: models struggle to effectively leverage long context, performing worse with an unbounded history than with truncated windows.

Although this level of detail is sound, it requires considerable human effort and substantial cost to annotate opinions in datasets for training models, especially across diverse domains and real-world applications. We explore the feasibility of LLMs as automatic annotators for fine-grained opinion analysis, addressing the shortage of domain-specific labelled datasets. In this work, we use a declarative annotation pipeline. This approach reduces the variability of manual prompt engineering when using LLMs to identify fine-grained opinion spans in text. We also present a novel methodology for an LLM to adjudicate multiple labels and produce final annotations. After trialling the pipeline with models of different sizes for the Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction (ASTE) and Aspect-Category-Opinion-Sentiment (ACOS) analysis tasks, we show that LLMs can serve as automatic annotators and adjudicators, achieving high Inter-Annotator Agreement across individual LLM-based annotators.

While single-view relighting has advanced significantly, existing generative approaches struggle to maintain the rigorous lighting consistency essential for multi-camera broadcasts, stereoscopic cinema, and virtual production. SyncLight addresses this by enabling precise control over light intensity and color across a multi-view capture of a scene, conditioned on a single reference edit. Our method leverages a multi-view diffusion transformer trained using a latent bridge matching formulation, achieving high-fidelity relighting of the entire image set in a single inference step. To facilitate training, we introduce a large-scale hybrid dataset comprising diverse synthetic environments -- curated from existing sources and newly designed scenes -- alongside high-fidelity, real-world multi-view captures under calibrated illumination. Surprisingly, though trained only on image pairs, SyncLight generalizes zero-shot to an arbitrary number of viewpoints, effectively propagating lighting changes across all views, without requiring camera pose information.

However, prior research has pointed to the high sensitivity of T2I towards particular input languages - when faced with languages other than English (i.e., different surface forms of the same prompt), T2I models often produce culturally stereotypical depictions, prioritizing the surface over the prompt's semantics. Yet a comprehensive analysis of this behavior, which we dub Surface-over-Semantics (SoS), is missing. We present the first analysis of T2I models' SoS tendencies. To this end, we create a set of prompts covering 171 cultural identities, translated into 14 languages, and use it to prompt seven T2I models. To quantify SoS tendencies across models, languages, and cultures, we introduce a novel measure and analyze how the tendencies we identify manifest visually. We show that all but one model exhibit strong surface-level tendency in at least two languages, with this effect intensifying across the layers of T2I text encoders.

In this work, we introduce \\textbf{AnyView}, a diffusion-based video generation framework for \\emph{dynamic view synthesis} with minimal inductive biases or geometric assumptions. We leverage multiple data sources with various levels of supervision, including monocular (2D), multi-view static (3D) and multi-view dynamic (4D) datasets, to train a generalist spatiotemporal implicit representation capable of producing zero-shot novel videos from arbitrary camera locations and trajectories. We evaluate AnyView on standard benchmarks, showing competitive results with the current state of the art, and propose \\textbf{AnyViewBench}, a challenging new benchmark tailored towards \\emph{extreme} dynamic view synthesis in diverse real-world scenarios. In this more dramatic setting, we find that most baselines drastically degrade in performance, as they require significant overlap between viewpoints, while AnyView maintains the ability to produce realistic, plausible, and spatiotemporally consistent videos when prompted from \\emph{any} viewpoint.

We introduce chess as a controlled testbed for disentangling these faculties. Leveraging the game's structure and scalable engine evaluations, we construct a taxonomy of positions varying in training corpus proximity--ranging from common states solvable by memorization to novel ones requiring first-principles reasoning. We systematically evaluate multiple GPT generations under varying reasoning intensities. Our analysis reveals a clear gradient: performance consistently degrades as fluid intelligence demands increase. Notably, in out-of-distribution tasks, performance collapses to random levels. While newer models improve, progress slows significantly for tasks outside the training distribution. Furthermore, while reasoning-augmented inference improves performance, its marginal benefit per token decreases with distributional proximity.

Specifically, early segments and segments in higher-resource languages like English are over-represented, while later segments and segments in lower-resource languages are marginalized. In our further analysis, we find that the positional bias stems from front-loaded attention distributions in pooling-token embeddings, where early tokens receive more attention.

In this paper, we categorize these strategies into three families: tagging the input text, indexing numerical positions of spans, and matching span content. To address the limitations of content matching, we introduce LogitMatch, a new constrained decoding method that forces the model's output to align with valid input spans. We evaluate all methods across four diverse tasks. We find that while tagging remains a robust baseline, LogitMatch improves upon competitive matching-based methods by eliminating span matching issues and outperforms other strategies in some setups.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u7528\u4e8e\u5e8f\u5217\u6807\u6ce8\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u4e2d\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u4e34\u65f6\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86LogitMatch\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5185\u5bb9\u5339\u914d\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0fLLMs\u7f3a\u4e4f\u76f4\u63a5\u5f15\u7528\u8f93\u5165\u7279\u5b9a\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6807\u6ce8\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u7c7b\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u73b0\u6709\u7b56\u7565\u5206\u4e3a\u6807\u7b7e\u6807\u6ce8\u3001\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7d22\u5f15\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u5339\u914d\u4e09\u7c7b\uff0c\u63d0\u51faLogitMatch\u7ea6\u675f\u89e3\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f3a\u5236\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0e\u6709\u6548\u8f93\u5165\u7247\u6bb5\u5bf9\u9f50\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u5185\u5bb9\u5339\u914d\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0c\u6807\u7b7e\u6807\u6ce8\u4ecd\u662f\u7a33\u5065\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u4f46LogitMatch\u5728\u6d88\u9664\u7247\u6bb5\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u540e\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5185\u5bb9\u5339\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u573a\u666f\u8d85\u8d8a\u5176\u4ed6\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7ea6\u675f\u673a\u5236\uff0cLogitMatch\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u5185\u5bb9\u5339\u914d\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6807\u7b7e\u6807\u6ce8\u4ecd\u5177\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}
