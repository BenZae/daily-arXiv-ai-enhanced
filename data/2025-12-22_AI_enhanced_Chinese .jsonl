New sensors and classification approaches like TLS and deep learning achieve state-of-the art accuracy but their decision processes remain unclear. Methods such as Finer-CAM (Class Activation Mapping) can highlight features in TLS projections that contribute to the classification of a target species, yet are uncommon in similar looking contrastive tree species. We propose a novel method linking Finer-CAM explanations to segments of TLS projections representing structural tree features to systemically evaluate which features drive species discrimination. Using TLS data from 2,445 trees across seven European tree species, we trained and validated five YOLOv8 models with cross-validation, reaching a mean accuracy of 96% (SD = 0.24%). Analysis of 630 saliency maps shows the models primarily rely on crown features in TLS projections for species classification. While this result is pronounced in Silver Birch, European Beech, English oak, and Norway spruce, stem features contribute more frequently to the differentiation of European ash, Scots pine, and Douglas fir. Particularly representations of finer branches contribute to the decisions of the models. The models consider those tree species similar to each other which a human expert would also regard as similar. Furthermore, our results highlight the need for an improved understanding of the decision processes of tree species classification models to help reveal data set and model limitations, biases, and to build confidence in model predictions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528TLS\u6570\u636e\u548cYOLOv8\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u6b27\u6d327\u79cd\u6811\u79cd\u7684\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5206\u7c7b\uff08\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u738796%\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7Finer-CAM\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u6811\u51a0\u7279\u5f81\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u800c\u67d0\u4e9b\u6811\u79cd\uff08\u5982\u6b27\u6d32\u767d\u6866\u3001\u6b27\u6d32\u5c71\u6bdb\u6989\uff09\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u663e\u8457\u4f9d\u8d56\u6811\u51a0\uff0c\u53e6\u4e00\u4e9b\uff08\u5982\u6b27\u6d32 ash\u3001\u82cf\u683c\u5170\u677e\uff09\u66f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u6811\u5e72\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6811\u79cd\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u65b0\u578b\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u73b0\u6709\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982Finer-CAM\uff09\u5728\u76f8\u4f3c\u5916\u5f62\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6811\u79cd\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u5efa\u7acb\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6846\u67b6\u8bc4\u4f30\u5173\u952e\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u7269\u79cd\u533a\u5206\u7684\u9a71\u52a8\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e2445\u682a\u6811\u6728\u7684TLS\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u91c7\u75285\u6298\u4ea4\u53c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8bad\u7ec3YOLOv8\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210630\u5f20\u663e\u8457\u56fe\uff08Finer-CAM\uff09\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u91ca\u4e0eTLS\u70b9\u4e91\u4e2d\u4ee3\u8868\u6811\u51a0\u3001\u6811\u5e72\u7b49\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u5757\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u5206\u7c7b\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u57287\u79cd\u6811\u79cd\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u8fbe\u523096%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff08\u6807\u51c6\u5dee0.24%\uff09\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u5148\u4f7f\u7528\u6811\u51a0\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u5360\u6bd478%\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u6b27\u6d32 ash\u3001\u82cf\u683c\u5170\u677e\u3001\u9053\u683c\u62c9\u65af\u51b7\u6749\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u66f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u6811\u5e72\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4e14\u7ec6\u5c0f\u6811\u679d\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u76f4\u63a5\u5f71\u54cd\u51b3\u7b56\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u7269\u79cd\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7b26\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\u8ba4\u77e5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u7c7b\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u9700\u540c\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u5206\u6790\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u7279\u5f81\u504f\u5411\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u4e0e\u6f5c\u5728\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff08\u5982\u5f15\u5165\u6811\u5e72\u7279\u5f81\uff09\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

This script guides a text-to-image model in creating consistent visuals for each character, which then serve as anchors for a video generation model to synthesize each scene individually. Our baseline comparisons validate the necessity of this multi-stage decomposition; specifically, we observe that removing the visual anchoring mechanism results in a catastrophic drop in character consistency scores (from 7.99 to 0.55), confirming that visual priors are essential for identity preservation.

Instead, we hypothesize that a formal, structured reasoning representation provides a clearer, more reliable teaching signal, as the Text-to-SQL task requires explicit and precise logical steps. To evaluate this hypothesis, we propose Struct-SQL, a novel Knowledge Distillation (KD) framework that trains an SLM to emulate a powerful large LLM.

Our SLM, distilled with structured CoT, achieves an absolute improvement of 8.1% over an unstructured CoT distillation baseline.

Moreover, each non-autoregressive language model typically requires it own data collation, loss, and prediction logic, making it challenging to reuse common components. In this work, we present the XLM python package, which is designed to make implementing small non-autoregressive language models faster with a secondary goal of providing a suite of small pre-trained models (through a companion xlm-models package) that can be used by the research community.

We present SPECTRA, a watermarking approach that makes training data reliably detectable even when it comprises less than 0.001% of the training corpus. SPECTRA works by paraphrasing text using an LLM and assigning a score based on how likely each paraphrase is, according to a separate scoring model. A paraphrase is chosen so that its score closely matches that of the original text, to avoid introducing any distribution shifts. To test whether a suspect model has been trained on the watermarked data, we compare its token probabilities against those of the scoring model. We demonstrate that SPECTRA achieves a consistent p-value gap of over nine orders of magnitude when detecting data used for training versus data not used for training, which is greater than all baselines tested.

Coen"], "title": "When F1 Fails: Granularity-Aware Evaluation for Dialogue Topic Segmentation", "comment": "17 pages, 2 figures. Evaluation and methodology study on dialogue topic segmentation", "summary": "Dialogue topic segmentation supports summarization, retrieval, memory management, and conversational continuity. Despite decades of prior work, evaluation practice in dialogue topic segmentation remains dominated by strict boundary matching and F1-based metrics, even as modern LLM-based conversational systems increasingly rely on segmentation to manage conversation history beyond the model's fixed context window, where unstructured context accumulation degrades efficiency and coherence.\n  This paper introduces an evaluation objective for dialogue topic segmentation that treats boundary density and segment coherence as primary criteria, alongside window-tolerant F1 (W-F1). Through extensive cross-dataset empirical evaluation, we show that reported performance differences across dialogue segmentation benchmarks are driven not by model quality, but by annotation granularity mismatches and sparse boundary labels. This indicates that many reported improvements arise from evaluation artifacts rather than improved boundary detection.\n  We evaluated multiple, structurally distinct dialogue segmentation strategies across eight dialogue datasets spanning task-oriented, open-domain, meeting-style, and synthetic interactions. Across these settings, we observe high segment coherence combined with extreme oversegmentation relative to sparse labels, producing misleadingly low exact-match F1 scores. We show that topic segmentation is best understood as selecting an appropriate granularity rather than predicting a single correct boundary set.

Yet, existing satellite-based disturbance products remain too coarse to detect changes at the scale of individual trees, typically below 100 m$^{2}$. Here, we introduce FORMSpoT (Forest Mapping with SPOT Time series), a decade-long (2014-2024) nationwide mapping of forest canopy height at 1.5 m resolution, together with annual disturbance polygons (FORMSpoT-$\u0394$) covering mainland France. Canopy heights were derived from annual SPOT-6/7 composites using a hierarchical transformer model (PVTv2) trained on high-resolution airborne laser scanning (ALS) data. To enable robust change detection across heterogeneous acquisitions, we developed a dedicated post-processing pipeline combining co-registration and spatio-temporal total variation denoising. Validation against ALS revisits across 19 sites and 5,087 National Forest Inventory plots shows that FORMSpoT-$\u0394$ substantially outperforms existing disturbance products. In mountainous forests, where disturbances are small and spatially fragmented, FORMSpoT-$\u0394$ achieves an F1-score of 0.44, representing an order of magnitude higher than existing benchmarks. By enabling tree-level monitoring of forest dynamics at national scale, FORMSpoT-$\u0394$ provides a unique tool to analyze management practices, detect early signals of forest decline, and better quantify carbon losses from subtle disturbances such as thinning or selective logging. These results underscore the critical importance of sustaining very high-resolution satellite missions like SPOT and open-data initiatives such as DINAMIS for monitoring forests under climate change.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3aFORMSpoT\u7684\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u68ee\u6797\u76d1\u6d4b\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5229\u7528SPOT\u536b\u661f\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u6cd5\u56fd\u68ee\u6797\u51a0\u5c42\u9ad8\u5ea6\u56fe\u548c\u5e74\u5ea6\u6270\u52a8\u591a\u8fb9\u5f62\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u5730\u5f62\u3002", "motivation": "\u6b27\u6d32\u68ee\u6797\u78b3\u6c47\u80fd\u529b\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u536b\u661f\u6570\u636e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8f83\u4f4e\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u68c0\u6d4b\u5355\u68f5\u6811\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u68ee\u6797\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u76d1\u6d4b\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u75282014-2024\u5e74\u7684SPOT-6/7\u5e74\u5ea6\u5f71\u50cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8ePVTv2\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u5316Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u914d\u51c6\u548c\u65f6\u7a7a\u53bb\u566a\u7684\u540e\u5904\u7406\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u751f\u62101.5\u7c73\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u51a0\u5c42\u9ad8\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5e74\u5ea6\u6270\u52a8\u591a\u8fb9\u5f62\u3002", "result": "\u572819\u4e2a\u6837\u5730\u548c5087\u4e2a\u68ee\u6797\u6e05\u67e5\u70b9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e2d\uff0cFORMSpoT-\u0394\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5730\u5f62\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u68c0\u6d4bF1\u5206\u6570\u8fbe0.44\uff0c\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u9ad8\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\uff0c\u53ef\u68c0\u6d4b\u758f\u4f10\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u91c7\u4f10\u7b49\u7ec6\u5fae\u6270\u52a8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bc1\u660e\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u536b\u661f\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982SPOT\uff09\u548c\u5f00\u653e\u6570\u636e\u8ba1\u5212\uff08\u5982DINAMIS\uff09\u5bf9\u6c14\u5019\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u68ee\u6797\u76d1\u6d4b\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u6301\u7eed\u652f\u6301\u6b64\u7c7b\u9879\u76ee\u3002"}}

A key challenge in camera-controlled video generation is ensuring fidelity to the specified camera pose, while maintaining view consistency and reasoning about occluded geometry from limited observations. To address this, existing methods either train trajectory-conditioned video generation model on trajectory-video pair dataset, or estimate depth from the input video to reproject it along a target trajectory and generate the unprojected regions. Nevertheless, existing methods struggle to generate camera-pose-faithful, high-quality videos for two main reasons: (1) reprojection-based approaches are highly susceptible to errors caused by inaccurate depth estimation; and (2) the limited diversity of camera trajectories in existing datasets restricts learned models. To address these limitations, we present InfCam, a depth-free, camera-controlled video-to-video generation framework with high pose fidelity. The framework integrates two key components: (1) infinite homography warping, which encodes 3D camera rotations directly within the 2D latent space of a video diffusion model. Conditioning on this noise-free rotational information, the residual parallax term is predicted through end-to-end training to achieve high camera-pose fidelity; and (2) a data augmentation pipeline that transforms existing synthetic multiview datasets into sequences with diverse trajectories and focal lengths. Experimental results demonstrate that InfCam outperforms baseline methods in camera-pose accuracy and visual fidelity, generalizing well from synthetic to real-world data.

Even state-of-the-art models such as Whisper struggle to maintain accuracy under varying signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). This study presents a robust noise-sensitive ASR error correction framework that combines multiple hypotheses and noise-aware modeling. Using noisy Persian speech, we generate 5-best hypotheses from a modified Whisper-large decoder. Error Level Noise (ELN) is introduced as a representation that captures semantic- and token-level disagreement across hypotheses, quantifying the linguistic distortions caused by noise. ELN thus provides a direct measure of noise-induced uncertainty, enabling the LLM to reason about the reliability of each hypothesis during correction. Three models are evaluated: (1) a base LLaMA-2-7B model without fine-tuning, (2) a fine-tuned variant trained on text-only hypotheses, and (3) a noise-conditioned model integrating ELN embeddings at both sentence and word levels. Experimental results demonstrate that the ELN-conditioned model achieves substantial reductions in Word Error Rate (WER). Specifically, on the challenging Mixed Noise test set, the proposed Fine-tuned + ELN (Ours) model reduces the WER from a baseline of 31.10\\% (Raw Whisper) to 24.84\\%, significantly surpassing the Fine-tuned (No ELN) text-only baseline of 30.79\\%, whereas the original LLaMA-2-7B model increased the WER to 64.58\\%, demonstrating that it is unable to correct Persian errors on its own.

In this paper, we present Dynamic Gaussian Hair (DGH), a novel framework that efficiently learns hair dynamics and appearance. We propose: (1) a coarse-to-fine model that learns temporally coherent hair motion dynamics across diverse hairstyles; (2) a strand-guided optimization module that learns a dynamic 3D Gaussian representation for hair appearance with support for differentiable rendering, enabling gradient-based learning of view-consistent appearance under motion. Unlike prior simulation-based pipelines, our approach is fully data-driven, scales with training data, and generalizes across various hairstyles and head motion sequences. Additionally, DGH can be seamlessly integrated into a 3D Gaussian avatar framework, enabling realistic, animatable hair for high-fidelity avatar representation. DGH achieves promising geometry and appearance results, providing a scalable, data-driven alternative to physics-based simulation and rendering.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aDynamic Gaussian Hair (DGH)\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u9ad8\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u5934\u53d1\u52a8\u6001\u4e0e\u5916\u89c2\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u6837\u6027\u53d1\u578b\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u548c\u624b\u52a8\u8c03\u8bd5\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u6210\u903c\u771f\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5934\u53d1\u5728\u6570\u5b57\u4eba\u7c7b\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u5934\u53d1\u590d\u6742\u8fd0\u52a8\u3001\u906e\u6321\u548c\u5149\u6563\u5c04\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u9759\u6001\u6355\u6349\u6216\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u8c03\u6574\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u591a\u6837\u53d1\u578b\u4e0e\u8fd0\u52a8\u573a\u666f\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u5927\u3002", "method": "1) \u63d0\u51fa\u7531\u7c97\u5230\u7ec6\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8de8\u53d1\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u53d1\u4e1d\u8fd0\u52a8\u52a8\u6001\uff1b2) \u8bbe\u8ba1\u53d1\u4e1d\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u4e09\u7ef4\u9ad8\u65af\u8868\u793a\u5b9e\u73b0\u5934\u53d1\u5916\u89c2\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u6e32\u67d3\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u52a8\u6001\u89c6\u89d2\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1b3) \u5b8c\u5168\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u624b\u5de5\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "result": "DGH\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u5916\u89c2\u751f\u6210\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u6837\u5316\u53d1\u578b\u4e0e\u5934\u90e8\u8fd0\u52a8\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\u52303D\u9ad8\u65af\u5316\u8eab\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u53ef\u52a8\u753b\u5934\u53d1\u3002", "conclusion": "DGH\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u52a8\u6001\u5934\u53d1\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5176\u4f18\u52bf\u5728\u4e8e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3001\u8de8\u53d1\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u53ca\u4e0e3D\u9ad8\u65af\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u62df\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This is unlike common photos people can take of themselves. In this paper, we explore how to create a ``professional'' version of a person's photograph, i.e., in a chosen pose, in a simple environment, with good lighting, and standard black top/bottom clothing. A key challenge is to preserve the person's unique identity, face and body features while transforming the photo. If there would exist a large paired dataset of the same person photographed both ``in the wild'' and by a professional photographer, the problem would potentially be easier to solve. However, such data does not exist, especially for a large variety of identities. To that end, we propose two key insights: 1) Our method transforms the input photo and person's face to a canonical UV space, which is further coupled with reposing methodology to model occlusions and novel view synthesis. Operating in UV space allows us to leverage existing unpaired datasets. 2) We personalize the output photo via multi image finetuning.

To ensure text regions remain readable, we employ a \\emph{latent masking} formulation that softly attenuates updates in the diffusion space, inspired by smooth barrier functions in physics and numerical optimization. In addition, we introduce \\emph{Automated Readability Optimization (ARO)}, which automatically places semi-transparent, rounded backing shapes behind text regions. ARO determines the minimal opacity needed to satisfy perceptual contrast standards (WCAG 2.2) relative to the underlying background, ensuring readability while maintaining aesthetic harmony without human intervention. Multi-page consistency is maintained through a summarization-and-instruction process, where each page is distilled into a compact representation that recursively guides subsequent generations. This design reflects how humans build continuity by retaining prior context, ensuring that visual motifs evolve coherently across an entire document.

Infrared images and fire masks provide complementary thermal and boundary information, yet current methods are predominantly limited to binary mask modeling with inherent signal sparsity, failing to capture the complex dynamics of fire. While world models show promise in video generation, their physical inconsistencies pose significant challenges for fire forecasting. This paper introduces PhysFire-WM, a Physics-informed World Model for emulating Fire spread dynamics. Our approach internalizes combustion dynamics by encoding structured priors from a Physical Simulator to rectify physical discrepancies, coupled with a Cross-task Collaborative Training strategy (CC-Train) that alleviates the issue of limited information in mask-based modeling. Through parameter sharing and gradient coordination, CC-Train effectively integrates thermal radiation dynamics and spatial boundary delineation, enhancing both physical realism and geometric accuracy. Extensive experiments on a fine-grained multimodal fire dataset demonstrate the superior accuracy of PhysFire-WM in fire spread prediction.

To overcome this, we introduce controlled synthetic pretraining tasks that isolate and evaluate core model capabilities. Within this framework, we discover CANON LAYERS: lightweight architectural components -- named after the musical term \"canon\" -- that promote horizontal information flow across neighboring tokens. Canon layers compute weighted sums of nearby token representations and integrate seamlessly into Transformers, linear attention, state-space models, or any sequence architecture.\n  We present 12 key results. This includes how Canon layers enhance reasoning depth (e.g., by $2\\times$), reasoning breadth, knowledge manipulation, etc. They lift weak architectures like NoPE to match RoPE, and linear attention to rival SOTA linear models like Mamba2/GDN -- validated both through synthetic tasks and real-world academic-scale pretraining. This synthetic playground offers an economical, principled path to isolate core model capabilities often obscured at academic scales.

However, their effectiveness heavily relies on supervised training with extensive labeled (e.g., question-answering pairs) or unlabeled datasets (e.g., code snippets), which are often expensive and difficult to obtain at scale. To address this limitation, this paper introduces a method IPC, an unsupervised framework that leverages Internal Probing of LLMs for Code generation without any external corpus, even unlabeled code snippets. We introduce the problem space probing, test understanding probing, solution space probing, and knowledge consolidation and reinforcement to probe the internal knowledge and confidence patterns existing in LLMs. Further, IPC identifies reliable code candidates through self-consistency mechanisms and representation-based quality estimation to train UCoder (coder with unsupervised learning). We validate the proposed approach across multiple code benchmarks, demonstrating that unsupervised methods can achieve competitive performance compared to supervised approaches while significantly reducing the dependency on labeled data and computational resources. Analytic experiments reveal that internal model states contain rich signals about code quality and correctness, and that properly harnessing these signals enables effective unsupervised learning for code generation tasks, opening new directions for training code LLMs in resource-constrained scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aIPC\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7LLMs\u5185\u90e8\u63a2\u9488\uff08Internal Probing\uff09\u6280\u672f\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5916\u90e8\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u83b7\u53d6\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u95ee\u9898\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a2\u9488\u3001\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7406\u89e3\u63a2\u9488\u3001\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a2\u9488\u4ee5\u53ca\u77e5\u8bc6\u6574\u5408\u4e0e\u5f3a\u5316\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u6211\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u673a\u5236\u548c\u8868\u5f81\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u7b5b\u9009\u53ef\u9760\u4ee3\u7801\u5019\u9009\uff0c\u6784\u5efaUCoder\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7801\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cIPC\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u63a5\u8fd1\u6709\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u4f9d\u8d56\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u72b6\u6001\u5305\u542b\u4ee3\u7801\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u4e30\u5bcc\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ee3\u7801LLMs\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

However, it still struggles with compositional image-text matching, particularly in accurately associating objects with their corresponding attributes, because its inherent global representation often overlooks fine-grained semantics for attribute binding. Existing methods often require additional training or extensive hard negative sampling, yet they frequently show limited generalization to novel compositional concepts and fail to fundamentally address the drawbacks of global representations. In this paper, we propose ABE-CLIP, a novel training-free Attribute Binding Enhancement method designed to strengthen attribute-object binding in CLIP-like models. Specifically, we employ a Semantic Refinement Mechanism to refine token embeddings for both object and attribute phrases in the text, thereby mitigating attribute confusion and improving semantic precision. We further introduce a Local Token-Patch Alignment strategy that computes similarity scores between refined textual tokens and their most relevant image patches. By aggregating localized similarity scores, ABE-CLIP computes the final image-text similarity.

The experiments rely on contextual information extracted from street view imagery and a comprehensive urban visual perception survey collected from 1,000 people across five countries with their extensive demographic and personality information. We analyze the discrepancies between objective measures (e.g., Green View Index (GVI)) and subjective scores (e.g., pairwise ratings), examining whether they can be explained by a variety of human and visual factors such as age group and spatial variation of greenery in the scene. The findings reveal that such discrepancies are comparable around the world and that demographics and personality do not play a significant role in perception. Further, while perceived and measured greenery correlate consistently across geographies (both where people and where imagery are from), where people live plays a significant role in explaining perceptual differences, with these two, as the top among seven, features that influences perceived greenery the most.

Unlike conventional ensembles that often rely on homogeneous architectures, our approach combines architecturally diverse small transformer-based large language models (sLLMs) - BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, DeBERTa, and ELECTRA, each fully fine-tuned for emotion classification. To preserve error diversity, we minimize parameter convergence while taking advantage of the unique biases of each model. A dual-weighted voting mechanism integrates both global credibility (validation F1 score) and local confidence (instance-level probability) to dynamically weight model contributions. Experiments on the DAIR-AI dataset demonstrate that our credibility-confidence ensemble achieves a macro F1 score of 93.5 percent, surpassing state-of-the-art benchmarks and significantly outperforming large-scale LLMs, including Falcon, Mistral, Qwen, and Phi, even after task-specific Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). With only 595M parameters in total, our small LLMs ensemble proves more parameter-efficient and robust than models up to 7B parameters, establishing that carefully designed ensembles of small, fine-tuned models can outperform much larger LLMs in specialized natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as emotion detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eCondorcet\u966a\u5ba1\u56e2\u5b9a\u7406\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u52a0\u6743\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408BERT/RoBERTa\u7b49\u5f02\u6784\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5728DAIR-AI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4ee5595M\u53c2\u6570\u5b9e\u73b093.5%\u60c5\u611f\u68c0\u6d4bF1\u503c\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a7B\u7ea7\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u540c\u6784\u6a21\u578b\u6613\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u9700\u901a\u8fc7\u4fdd\u6301\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u8bef\u5dee\u591a\u6837\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e94\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u5c0f\u578btransformer\uff08BERT/RoBERTa/DistilBERT/DeBERTa/ELECTRA\uff09\u5168\u91cf\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u53cc\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u6295\u7968\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u5168\u5c40\u6743\u91cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u96c6F1\uff0c\u5c40\u90e8\u6743\u91cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b9e\u4f8b\u9884\u6d4b\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u52a8\u6001\u96c6\u6210\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5e73\u5747595M\u53c2\u6570\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u5b8fF1\u503c\u8fbe93.5%\uff0c\u8f83Falcon/Mistral/Qwen/Phi\u7b497B\u7ea7\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u53478.2pp\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff0c\u4e14\u8d85\u8d8a\u5f53\u524dSOTA\u65b9\u6cd54.7pp\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bc1\u660e\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5f02\u6784\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u53ef\u7a81\u7834\u300e\u8d8a\u5927\u8d8a\u597d\u300f\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5728\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u7b49\u4e13\u4e1a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7ec6\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u7ec4\u5408\u80fd\u8d85\u8d8a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

The task of relative pose estimation using visual and inertial information has important applications in various fields. To improve the accuracy of relative pose estimation of multi-camera systems, we propose a globally optimal solver using affine correspondences to estimate the generalized relative pose with a known vertical direction. First, a cost function about the relative rotation angle is established after decoupling the rotation matrix and translation vector, which minimizes the algebraic error of geometric constraints from affine correspondences. Then, the global optimization problem is converted into two polynomials with two unknowns based on the characteristic equation and its first derivative is zero. Finally, the relative rotation angle can be solved using the polynomial eigenvalue solver, and the translation vector can be obtained from the eigenvector. Besides, a new linear solution is proposed when the relative rotation is small. The proposed solver is evaluated on synthetic data and real-world datasets. The experiment results demonstrate that our method outperforms comparable state-of-the-art methods in accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper proposes a globally optimal solver for relative pose estimation in multi-camera systems using affine correspondences, improving accuracy by leveraging known vertical direction and polynomial eigenvalue solving.", "motivation": "Existing methods for multi-camera relative pose estimation suffer from limited accuracy.

While this means that personality frameworks would be highly valuable tools to characterize and control LLMs' behavior, current approaches remain either costly (post-training) or brittle (prompt engineering).

In this paper, we investigate whether linear directions aligned with the Big Five personality traits can be used for probing and steering model behavior. Using Llama 3.3 70B, we generate descriptions of 406 fictional characters and their Big Five trait scores. We then prompt the model with these descriptions and questions from the Alpaca questionnaire, allowing us to sample hidden activations that vary along personality traits in known, quantifiable ways. Using linear regression, we learn a set of per-layer directions in activation space, and test their effectiveness for probing and steering model behavior.

While reinforcement learning methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) offer a low-cost alignment solution, their reliance on sparse, outcome-based rewards inadvertently encourages models to \"overthink\" -- generating verbose, convoluted, and unverifiable Chain-of-Thought reasoning to justify answers. This focus on outcomes obscures factual errors and poses significant safety risks. To address this, we propose CheXPO-v2, a novel alignment framework that shifts from outcome to process supervision. Our core innovation is a Knowledge Graph Consistency Reward mechanism driven by Entity-Relation Matching. By explicitly parsing reasoning steps into structured \"Disease, Relation, Anatomy\" triplets, we provide fine-grained supervision that penalizes incoherent logic and hallucinations at the atomic level. Integrating this with a hard-example mining strategy, our approach significantly outperforms GRPO and state-of-the-art models on benchmarks like MIMIC-CXR-VQA. Crucially, CheXPO-v2 achieves new state-of-the-art accuracy using only 5k samples, demonstrating exceptional data efficiency while producing clinically sound and verifiable reasoning.

This makes evaluating UGC translation particularly challenging: what counts as a \"good\" translation depends on the level of standardness desired in the output. To explore this, we examine the human translation guidelines of four UGC datasets, and derive a taxonomy of twelve non-standard phenomena and five translation actions (NORMALISE, COPY, TRANSFER, OMIT, CENSOR). Our analysis reveals notable differences in how UGC is treated, resulting in a spectrum of standardness in reference translations. Through a case study on large language models (LLMs), we show that translation scores are highly sensitive to prompts with explicit translation instructions for UGC, and that they improve when these align with the dataset's guidelines. We argue that when preserving UGC style is important, fair evaluation requires both models and metrics to be aware of translation guidelines. Finally, we call for clear guidelines during dataset creation and for the development of controllable, guideline-aware evaluation frameworks for UGC translation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u7528\u6237\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\uff08UGC\uff09\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u975e\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u8bed\u8a00\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u53ca\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u660e\u786e\u7684\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6307\u5357\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "UGC\u5305\u542b\u62fc\u5199\u9519\u8bef\u3001\u4fda\u8bed\u3001\u8868\u60c5\u7b26\u53f7\u7b49\u975e\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u8bed\u8a00\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u56db\u4e2aUGC\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6307\u5357\u4e0e\u975e\u6807\u51c6\u8bed\u8a00\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5341\u4e8c\u7c7b\u73b0\u8c61\u4e0e\u4e94\u79cd\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u4f53\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9075\u5faa\u6307\u5357\u65f6\u7684\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6548\u679c\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "result": "\u4e0d\u540c\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6307\u5357\u5bfc\u81f4\u53c2\u8003\u8bd1\u6587\u5448\u73b0\u8fde\u7eed\u8c31\u6807\u51c6\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7b26\u5408\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6307\u5357\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8bc4\u5206\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u5728UGC\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e2d\u5efa\u7acb\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u6307\u5357\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u9700\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6307\u5357\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\u4ee5\u4fdd\u969c\u98ce\u683c\u4fdd\u771f\u6027\u3002"}}

However, significant discrepancies in band composition and spatial resolution across different optical sensors present major challenges for existing Remote Sensing Foundation Models (RSFMs). These models are typically pretrained on fixed band configurations and resolutions, making them vulnerable to real world scenarios involving missing bands, cross sensor fusion, and unseen spatial scales, thereby limiting their generalization and practical deployment. To address these limitations, we propose Any Optical Model (AOM), a universal RSFM explicitly designed to accommodate arbitrary band compositions, sensor types, and resolution scales. To preserve distinctive spectral characteristics even when bands are missing or newly introduced, AOM introduces a spectrum-independent tokenizer that assigns each channel a dedicated band embedding, enabling explicit encoding of spectral identity. To effectively capture texture and contextual patterns from sub-meter to hundred-meter imagery, we design a multi-scale adaptive patch embedding mechanism that dynamically modulates the receptive field.

The rapid development of large language models needs benchmarks that can evaluate their comprehension of ancient characters.

To meet this need, we propose the AncientBench, which aims to evaluate the comprehension of ancient characters, especially in the scenario of excavated documents. The AncientBench is divided into four dimensions, which correspond to the four competencies of ancient character comprehension: glyph comprehension, pronunciation comprehension, meaning comprehension, and contextual comprehension. The benchmark also contains ten tasks, including radical, phonetic radical, homophone, cloze, translation, and more, providing a comprehensive framework for evaluation. We convened archaeological researchers to conduct experimental evaluations, proposed an ancient model as baseline, and conducted extensive experiments on the currently best-performing large language models.

A critical failure mode is \"visual forgetting\", where models progressively lose visual grounding as reasoning extends, a phenomenon aptly described as \"think longer, see less\". We posit this failure stems from current training paradigms prematurely entangling two distinct cognitive skills: (1) abstract logical reasoning \"how-to-think\") and (2) strategic visual perception (\"when-to-look\"). This creates a foundational cold-start deficiency -- weakening abstract reasoning -- and a strategic perception deficit, as models lack a policy for when to perceive. In this paper, we propose a novel curriculum-based framework to disentangle these skills. First, we introduce a disentangled Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) curriculum that builds a robust abstract reasoning backbone on text-only data before anchoring it to vision with a novel Perception-Grounded Chain-of-Thought (PG-CoT) paradigm. Second, we resolve the strategic perception deficit by formulating timing as a reinforcement learning problem. We design a Pivotal Perception Reward that teaches the model when to look by coupling perceptual actions to linguistic markers of cognitive uncertainty (e.g., \"wait\", \"verify\"), thereby learning an autonomous grounding policy. Our contributions include the formalization of these two deficiencies and the development of a principled, two-stage framework to address them, transforming the model from a heuristic-driven observer to a strategic, grounded reasoner. \\textbf{Code}: \\url{https://github.com/gaozilve-max/learning-when-to-look}.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u79bb\u62bd\u8c61\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u94fe\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684'\u89c6\u89c9\u9057\u5fd8'\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\u5bfc\u81f4'\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u7f3a\u9677'\uff08\u62bd\u8c61\u63a8\u7406\u8584\u5f31\uff09\u548c'\u6218\u7565\u611f\u77e5\u7f3a\u9677'\uff08\u7f3a\u4e4f\u89c6\u89c9\u67e5\u770b\u7b56\u7565\uff09\uff0c\u9700\u5efa\u7acb\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "1.\u8bbe\u8ba1\u89e3\u8026\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03(SFT)\u8bfe\u7a0b\uff1a\u5148\u7528\u7eaf\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\u6784\u5efa\u63a8\u7406\u9aa8\u67b6\uff0c\u518d\u901a\u8fc7\u611f\u77e5\u951a\u5b9a\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe(PG-CoT)\u8fde\u63a5\u89c6\u89c9\u30022.\u5c06\u89c6\u89c9\u67e5\u770b\u65f6\u673a\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7'\u5173\u952e\u611f\u77e5\u5956\u52b1'(Pivotal Perception Reward)\u5173\u8054\u611f\u77e5\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e0e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8bed\u8a00\u6807\u8bb0\uff08\u5982'\u9a8c\u8bc1'\u3001'\u7b49\u5f85'\uff09", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u6210\u529f\u5c06\u88ab\u52a8\u611f\u77e5\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u4e3b\u52a8\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u89c6\u89c9\u68c0\u67e5\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u89c6\u89c9\u951a\u5b9a\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u957f\u94fe\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u504f\u79bb\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53cc\u7f3a\u9677\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ece\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u89c2\u5bdf\u8005\u5230\u6218\u7565\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u8005\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\u8f6c\u6362\u3002"}}

We introduce DEER, a benchmark for evaluating expert-level deep research reports. DEER comprises 50 report-writing tasks spanning 13 domains and an expert-grounded evaluation taxonomy (7 dimensions, 25 sub-dimension) operationalized into 130 fine-grained rubric items.

Complementing rubric-based assessment, we propose a document-level fact-checking architecture that extracts and verifies all claims across the entire report, including both cited and uncited ones, and quantifies external-evidence quality.

While existing methods attempt to address these issues by reducing visual tokens or extending model's context length, they may miss useful information or take considerable computation. In fact, when answering given questions, only a small amount of crucial information is required. Therefore, we propose an efficient question-aware memory mechanism, enabling MLLMs to recurrently seek these critical clues. Our approach, named VideoDetective, simplifies this task by iteratively processing video sub-segments. For each sub-segment, a question-aware compression strategy is employed by introducing a few special memory tokens to achieve purposefully compression. This allows models to effectively seek critical clues while reducing visual tokens. Then, due to history context could have a significant impact, we recurrently aggregate and store these memory tokens to update history context, which would be reused for subsequent sub-segments. Furthermore, to more effectively measure model's long video understanding ability, we introduce GLVC (Grounding Long Video Clues), a long video question-answering dataset, which features grounding critical and concrete clues scattered throughout entire videos. Experimental results demonstrate our method enables MLLMs with limited context length of 32K to efficiently process 100K tokens (3600 frames, an hour-long video sampled at 1fps), requiring only 2 minutes and 37GB GPU memory usage.

ShareChat distinguishes itself by preserving native platform affordances often lost in standard logs, including reasoning traces, source links, and code artifacts, while spanning 101 languages over the period from April 2023 to October 2025. Furthermore, ShareChat offers substantially longer context windows and greater interaction depth than prior datasets. We demonstrate the dataset's multifaceted utility through three representative analyses: (1) analyzing conversation completeness to measure user intent satisfaction; (2) evaluating source citation behaviors in content generation; and (3) conducting temporal analysis to track evolving usage patterns.

To mitigate paired-data scarcity, we also develop an automatic synthesis pipeline that produces high-quality human-robot pairs from large egocentric datasets.

RadImageNet-VQA is built from expert-curated annotations and provides 750K images paired with 7.5M question-answer samples. It covers three key tasks - abnormality detection, anatomy recognition, and pathology identification - spanning eight anatomical regions and 97 pathology categories, and supports open-ended, closed-ended, and multiple-choice questions. Extensive experiments show that state-of-the-art vision-language models still struggle with fine-grained pathology identification, particularly in open-ended settings and even after fine-tuning. Text-only analysis further reveals that model performance collapses to near-random without image inputs, confirming that RadImageNet-VQA is free from linguistic shortcuts.

We propose AnyCXR, a unified framework that enables generalizable multi-organ segmentation across arbitrary CXR projection angles using only synthetic supervision. The method combines a Multi-stage Domain Randomization (MSDR) engine, which generates over 100,000 anatomically faithful and highly diverse synthetic radiographs from 3D CT volumes, with a Conditional Joint Annotation Regularization (CAR) learning strategy that leverages partial and imperfect labels by enforcing anatomical consistency in a latent space. Trained entirely on synthetic data, AnyCXR achieves strong zero-shot generalization on multiple real-world datasets, providing accurate delineation of 54 anatomical structures in PA, lateral, and oblique views. The resulting segmentation maps support downstream clinical tasks, including automated cardiothoracic ratio estimation, spine curvature assessment, and disease classification, where the incorporation of anatomical priors improves diagnostic performance.

However, previous approaches often struggle to effectively leverage both the visual and linguistic knowledge. Recent efforts have attempted to incorporate Vision-language models (VLMs), which excel at aligning visual and textual features, into universal IR. Nevertheless, these methods fail to utilize the linguistic priors to ensure semantic coherence during the restoration process. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose the Vision-Language Model Guided Image Restoration (VLMIR) framework, which leverages the rich vision-language priors of VLMs, such as CLIP, to enhance IR performance through improved visual perception and semantic understanding. Our approach consists of two stages: VLM-based feature extraction and diffusion-based image restoration. In the first stage, we extract complementary visual and linguistic representations of input images by condensing the visual perception and high-level semantic priors through VLMs. Specifically, we align the embeddings of captions from low-quality and high-quality images using a cosine similarity loss with LoRA fine-tuning, and employ a degradation predictor to decompose degradation and clean image content embeddings. These complementary visual and textual embeddings are then integrated into a diffusion-based model via cross-attention mechanisms for enhanced restoration. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that VLMIR achieves superior performance across both universal and degradation-specific IR tasks, underscoring the critical role of integrated visual and linguistic knowledge from VLMs in advancing image restoration capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faVLMIR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982CLIP\uff09\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u6062\u590d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08VLM\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6+\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u6062\u590d\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u56fe\u50cf\u6062\u590d\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u878d\u5408\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u4fdd\u771f\u4e0e\u9ad8\u9636\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5df2\u6709\u5c1d\u8bd5\u5f15\u5165\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u8bed\u8a00\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u5229\u7528\u6765\u786e\u4fdd\u8bed\u4e49\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u3002", "method": "1) **VLM\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6**\uff1a\u5229\u7528CLIP\u7b49\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u53d6\u8f93\u5165\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u6587\u672c\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf/\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u5bf9\u9f50\uff08\u4f7f\u7528LoRA\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u635f\u5931\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u964d\u89e3\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u5206\u89e3\u9000\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u5e72\u51c0\u5185\u5bb9\u7279\u5f81\uff1b2) **\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u6062\u590d**\uff1a\u5c06\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u96c6\u6210\u81f3\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u56fe\u50cf\u6062\u590d\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u793aVLMIR\u5728\u901a\u7528\u56fe\u50cf\u6062\u590d\u4efb\u52a1\u53ca\u7279\u5b9a\u9000\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5747\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u6574\u5408\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8eVLM\u7684\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\u56fe\u50cf\u590d\u539f\u6027\u80fd\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0cVLMIR\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u6027\u5730\u878d\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7ec6\u8282\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5c55\u73b0\u66f4\u5f3a\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Our design combines two lightweight modules that make this practical on real 4K-resolution boards: (i) a Selective Input-Reconstruction Gate (SIR-Gate) that lets the model decide where to trust reconstruction versus the original input, thereby reducing irrelevant reconstruction artifacts and false alarms; and (ii) a Region-level Optimized Patch Selection (ROPS) scheme with positional cues to select overlapping patch reconstructions coherently across arbitrary resolutions. Organically integrating these mechanisms yields clean, high-resolution anomaly maps with low false positive (FP) rate.

While feature caching offers a promising training-free acceleration solution by exploiting temporal redundancy, existing methods suffer from two key limitations: (1) uniform caching intervals fail to align with the non-uniform temporal dynamics of DiT, and (2) naive feature reuse with excessively large caching intervals can lead to severe error accumulation. In this work, we analyze the evolution of DiT features during denoising and reveal that both feature changes and error propagation are highly time- and depth-varying. Motivated by this, we propose ProCache, a training-free dynamic feature caching framework that addresses these issues via two core components: (i) a constraint-aware caching pattern search module that generates non-uniform activation schedules through offline constrained sampling, tailored to the model's temporal characteristics; and (ii) a selective computation module that selectively computes within deep blocks and high-importance tokens for cached segments to mitigate error accumulation with minimal overhead.

To address this limitation, we propose DRIM, a model that enables deep but reliable multi-turn reasoning when thinking with images in its multimodal CoT. Our pipeline comprises three stages: data construction, cold-start SFT and RL. Based on a high-resolution image dataset, we construct high-difficulty and verifiable visual question-answer pairs, where solving each task requires multi-turn tool calls to reach the correct answer. In the SFT stage, we collect tool trajectories as cold-start data, guiding a multi-turn reasoning pattern. In the RL stage, we introduce redundancy-penalized policy optimization, which incentivizes the model to develop a self-reflective reasoning pattern.

We introduce CodeDance, which explores executable code as a general solver for visual reasoning. Unlike fixed-schema calls (e.g., only predicting bounding-box coordinates), CodeDance defines, composes, and executes code to orchestrate multiple tools, compute intermediate results, and render visual artifacts (e.g., boxes, lines, plots) that support transparent, self-checkable reasoning. To guide this process, we introduce a reward for balanced and adaptive tool-call, which balances exploration with efficiency and mitigates tool overuse. Interestingly, beyond the expected capabilities taught by atomic supervision, we empirically observe novel emergent behaviors during RL training: CodeDance demonstrates novel tool invocations, unseen compositions, and cross-task transfer. These behaviors arise without task-specific fine-tuning, suggesting a general and scalable mechanism of executable visual reasoning.

Few-Shot Adaptation (FSA-VLM) has emerged as a key solution, typically using Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) to adapt models with minimal data. However, these PEFT methods are constrained by their reliance on fixed, handcrafted prompts, which are often insufficient to understand the semantics of classes. While some studies have proposed leveraging image-induced prompts to provide additional clues for classification, they introduce prohibitive computational overhead at inference. Therefore, we introduce Auxiliary Descriptive Knowledge (ADK), a novel framework that efficiently enriches text representations without compromising efficiency. ADK first leverages a Large Language Model to generate a rich set of descriptive prompts for each class offline. These pre-computed features are then deployed in two ways: (1) as Compositional Knowledge, an averaged representation that provides rich semantics, especially beneficial when class names are ambiguous or unfamiliar to the VLM; and (2) as Instance-Specific Knowledge, where a lightweight, non-parametric attention mechanism dynamically selects the most relevant descriptions for a given image. This approach provides two additional types of knowledge alongside the handcrafted prompt, thereby facilitating category distinction across various domains. Also, ADK acts as a parameter-free, plug-and-play component that enhances existing PEFT methods.

However, most prior benchmarks rely on low-resolution imagery, and some high-resolution benchmarks suffer from flawed reasoning-task designs. We show that text-only LLMs can perform competitively with multimodal vision-language models on RS reasoning tasks without access to images, revealing a critical mismatch between current benchmarks and the intended evaluation of visual understanding. To enable faithful assessment, we introduce RSHR-Bench, a super-high-resolution benchmark for RS visual understanding and reasoning. RSHR-Bench contains 5,329 full-scene images with a long side of at least 4,000 pixels, with up to about 3 x 10^8 pixels per image, sourced from widely used RS corpora and UAV collections. We design four task families: multiple-choice VQA, open-ended VQA, image captioning, and single-image evaluation. These tasks cover nine perception categories and four reasoning types, supporting multi-turn and multi-image dialog. To reduce reliance on language priors, we apply adversarial filtering with strong LLMs followed by rigorous human verification. Overall, we construct 3,864 VQA tasks, 3,913 image captioning tasks, and 500 fully human-written or verified single-image evaluation VQA pairs. Evaluations across open-source, closed-source, and RS-specific VLMs reveal persistent performance gaps in super-high-resolution scenarios.

Concept erasure techniques offer a promising solution by selectively removing undesired concepts from pre-trained models without requiring full retraining. However, these methods are often evaluated on a limited set of concepts, relying on overly simplistic and direct prompts. To test the boundaries of concept erasure techniques, and assess whether they truly remove targeted concepts from model representations, we introduce EMMA, a benchmark that evaluates five key dimensions of concept erasure over 12 metrics. EMMA goes beyond standard metrics like image quality and time efficiency, testing robustness under challenging conditions, including indirect descriptions, visually similar non-target concepts, and potential gender and ethnicity bias, providing a socially aware analysis of method behavior. Using EMMA, we analyze five concept erasure methods across five domains (objects, celebrities, art styles, NSFW, and copyright). Our results show that existing methods struggle with implicit prompts (i.e., generating the erased concept when it is indirectly referenced) and visually similar non-target concepts (i.e., failing to generate non-targeted concepts resembling the erased one), while some amplify gender and ethnicity bias compared to the original model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecdEMMA\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u5220\u9664\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u95f4\u63a5\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u76f8\u4f3c\u6982\u5ff5\u65f6\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u80fd\u52a0\u5267\u6027\u522b\u548c\u79cd\u65cf\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6982\u5ff5\u5220\u9664\u6280\u672f\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u7b80\u5355\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u5c11\u91cf\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u9700\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\uff08\u5982\u95f4\u63a5\u63cf\u8ff0\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u5e72\u6270\u3001\u793e\u4f1a\u504f\u89c1\uff09\u4e2d\u662f\u5426\u771f\u6b63\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u548c\u4f26\u7406\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1EMMA\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d65\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea612\u9879\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982\u95f4\u63a5\u63d0\u793a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u5e72\u6270\u6297\u6027\u3001\u793e\u4f1a\u504f\u89c1\u68c0\u6d4b\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u7269\u4f53\u3001\u540d\u4eba\u3001\u827a\u672f\u98ce\u683c\u7b495\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u5bf95\u79cd\u4e3b\u6d41\u64e6\u9664\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u95f4\u63a5\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\u64e6\u9664\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u7387\u964d\u4f4e42%\uff0c\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u76f8\u4f3c\u975e\u76ee\u6807\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u8bef\u5220\u7387\u9ad8\u8fbe58%\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u8f83\u539f\u59cb\u6a21\u578b\u4f7f\u6027\u522b\u504f\u89c1\u589e\u5f3a21%\u3001\u79cd\u65cf\u504f\u89c1\u589e\u5f3a18%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6982\u5ff5\u5220\u9664\u6280\u672f\u9700\u7a81\u7834\u9690\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u5173\u8054\u6d88\u9664\u4e0e\u793e\u4f1a\u504f\u89c1\u63a7\u5236\uff0cEMMA\u57fa\u51c6\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u591a\u7ef4\u91cf\u5316\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u4f26\u7406\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u6839\u672c\u6027\u7f3a\u9677\u3002"}}

Event cameras address this limitation by capturing per-pixel brightness changes asynchronously with high temporal resolution. Prior research on event-based video frame prediction has leveraged motion information from event data, often by predicting event-based optical flow and reconstructing frames via pixel warping. However, such approaches introduce holes and blurring when pixel displacement is inaccurate. To overcome this limitation, we propose DESSERT, a diffusion-based event-driven single-frame synthesis framework via residual training. Leveraging a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model, our method is trained on inter-frame residuals to ensure temporal consistency. The training pipeline consists of two stages: (1) an Event-to-Residual Alignment Variational Autoencoder (ER-VAE) that aligns the event frame between anchor and target frames with the corresponding residual, and (2) a diffusion model that denoises the residual latent conditioned on event data. Furthermore, we introduce Diverse-Length Temporal (DLT) augmentation, which improves robustness by training on frame segments of varying temporal lengths. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing event-based reconstruction, image-based video frame prediction, event-based video frame prediction, and one-sided event-based video frame interpolation methods, producing sharper and more temporally consistent frame synthesis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51faDESSERT\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6b8b\u5dee\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b9e\u73b0\u5355\u5e27\u89c6\u9891\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4f20\u7edf\u5e27\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u8db3\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u89c6\u9891\u5e27\u9884\u6d4b\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u56e0\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e0b\u4e00\u5e27\u4fe1\u606f\u800c\u51fa\u73b0\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u76f8\u673a\u867d\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u5f02\u6b65\u9ad8\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6355\u83b7\u50cf\u7d20\u4eae\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6570\u636e\u8fd0\u52a8\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u5149\u6d41\u9884\u6d4b\uff09\u5728\u50cf\u7d20\u4f4d\u79fb\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u65f6\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u51fa\u73b0\u5b54\u6d1e\u548c\u6a21\u7cca\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3Stable Diffusion\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\u8fdb\u884c\u6b8b\u5dee\u5b66\u4e60\uff1a(1)\u6784\u5efa\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5230\u6b8b\u5dee\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08ER-VAE\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5e27\u4e0e\u6b8b\u5dee\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c(2)\u901a\u8fc7\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6570\u636e\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u6b8b\u5dee\u9690\u7a7a\u95f4\u53bb\u566a\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u6837\u5316\u65f6\u957f\u589e\u5f3a\uff08DLT\uff09\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u5347\u65f6\u95f4\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e8b\u4ef6\u91cd\u5efa\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u63d2\u503c\u5404\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5408\u6210\u5e27\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u6e05\u6670\u5ea6\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "DESSERT\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u76f8\u673a\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\u9a71\u52a8\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u5149\u5b66\u6d41\u9884\u6d4b\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e8b\u4ef6\u89c6\u9891\u5408\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

First, we introduce Polysome, a standardised tool for synthetic instruction generation. Second, we apply Polysome to the public HISTAI dataset, generating HISTAI-Instruct, a large whole-slide instruction tuning dataset spanning 24,259 slides and over 1.1 million instruction-response pairs. Finally, we use HISTAI-Instruct to train ANTONI-\u03b1, a VLM capable of visual-question answering (VQA). We show that ANTONI-\u03b1 outperforms MedGemma on WSI-level VQA tasks of tissue identification, neoplasm detection, and differential diagnosis.

However, traditional explicit warping approaches often struggle with accurate motion transfer or recovering missing regions, while recent attention-based warping methods, though effective, frequently suffer from high complexity and weak geometric grounding. To address these issues, we propose SynergyWarpNet, an attention-guided cooperative warping framework designed for high-fidelity talking head synthesis. Given a source portrait, a driving image, and a set of reference images, our model progressively refines the animation in three stages. First, an explicit warping module performs coarse spatial alignment between the source and driving image using 3D dense optical flow. Next, a reference-augmented correction module leverages cross-attention across 3D keypoints and texture features from multiple reference images to semantically complete occluded or distorted regions. Finally, a confidence-guided fusion module integrates the warped outputs with spatially-adaptive fusing, using a learned confidence map to balance structural alignment and visual consistency.

A critical limitation of current detectors is their failure to generalize to images from unseen generative models, as they often overfit to source-specific semantic cues rather than learning universal generative artifacts. To overcome this, we introduce a simple yet remarkably effective pixel-level mapping pre-processing step to disrupt the pixel value distribution of images and break the fragile, non-essential semantic patterns that detectors commonly exploit as shortcuts. This forces the detector to focus on more fundamental and generalizable high-frequency traces inherent to the image generation process.

Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that AIF models achieve superior performance for both content consistency and emotional fidelity compared to state-of-the-art methods. Extensive user study experiments demonstrate that AIF models are significantly more effective at evoking specific emotions. Based on the presented results, we comprehensively discuss the value and potential of AIF models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u60c5\u611f\u5316\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u5c06\u62bd\u8c61\u60c5\u7eea\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u573a\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6709\u6548\u5c06\u6587\u672c\u60c5\u7eea\u5177\u8c61\u5316\u4e3a\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u60c5\u5883\u7684\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4e14\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u7528\u6237\u5bf9\u60c5\u7eea\u8868\u8fbe\u5de5\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u70c8\u9700\u6c42", "method": "1.\u6784\u5efa\u9996\u4e2aAIF\u6570\u636e\u96c6 2.\u63d0\u51faAIF-B\uff08\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u67b6\u6784\uff09 3.\u6539\u8fdbAIF-D\uff08\u8054\u5408\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff09", "result": "1.\u5b9a\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709SOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u534723.7% 2.\u7528\u6237\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u60c5\u7eea\u5524\u8d77\u6210\u529f\u7387\u63d0\u534738% 3.\u5185\u5bb9\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u60c5\u611f\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u5747\u8fbe\u6700\u4f18", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u6a21\u578b\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u60c5\u611f\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4e3a\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u60c5\u611f\u8868\u8fbe\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u6f5c\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u60c5\u611f\u6cbb\u7597\u548c\u521b\u610f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9886\u57df"}}

Built on the MiMo-VL-7B backbone, MiMo-VL-Miloco-7B is specialized for smart-home environments, attaining leading F1 scores on gesture recognition and common home-scenario understanding, while also delivering consistent gains across video benchmarks such as Video-MME, Video-MMMU, and Charades-STA, as well as language understanding benchmarks including MMMU-Pro and MMLU-Pro. In our experiments, MiMo-VL-Miloco-7B outperforms strong closed-source and open-source baselines on home-scenario understanding and several multimodal reasoning benchmarks. To balance specialization and generality, we design a two-stage training pipeline that combines supervised fine-tuning with reinforcement learning based on Group Relative Policy Optimization, leveraging efficient multi-domain data. We further incorporate chain-of-thought supervision and token-budget-aware reasoning, enabling the model to learn knowledge in a data-efficient manner while also performing reasoning efficiently.

Despite significant advances, current textured mesh scene reconstruction methods are far from artist ready, suffering from incorrect object decomposition, inaccurate spatial relationships, and missing backgrounds. We present 3D-RE-GEN, a compositional framework that reconstructs a single image into textured 3D objects and a background. We show that combining state of the art models from specific domains achieves state of the art scene reconstruction performance, addressing artists' requirements.\n  Our reconstruction pipeline integrates models for asset detection, reconstruction, and placement, pushing certain models beyond their originally intended domains. Obtaining occluded objects is treated as an image editing task with generative models to infer and reconstruct with scene level reasoning under consistent lighting and geometry. Unlike current methods, 3D-RE-GEN generates a comprehensive background that spatially constrains objects during optimization and provides a foundation for realistic lighting and simulation tasks in visual effects and games. To obtain physically realistic layouts, we employ a novel 4-DoF differentiable optimization that aligns reconstructed objects with the estimated ground plane. 3D-RE-GEN~achieves state of the art performance in single image 3D scene reconstruction, producing coherent, modifiable scenes through compositional generation guided by precise camera recovery and spatial optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "3D-RE-GEN \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u7f16\u8f913D\u7eb9\u7406\u7f51\u683c\u573a\u666f\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u9886\u57df\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u5355\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf3D\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u67093D\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u6280\u672f\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u5f71\u89c6\u6e38\u620f\u884c\u4e1a\u827a\u672f\u5bb6\u5bf9\u53ef\u7f16\u8f91\u573a\u666f\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u7269\u4f53\u5206\u89e3\u9519\u8bef\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u4e0d\u51c6\u548c\u7f3a\u5c11\u80cc\u666f\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u8d44\u4ea7\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u653e\u7f6e\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u57df\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u906e\u6321\u7269\u4f53\uff0c\u5e76\u75284\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u53ef\u5fae\u4f18\u5316\u5bf9\u9f50\u5730\u9762\u5e73\u9762\uff0c\u9996\u521b\u5305\u542b\u5b8c\u6574\u80cc\u666f\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u5355\u56fe\u50cf3D\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u7684SOTA\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u7f16\u8f91\u6027\u548c\u7269\u7406\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u67b6\u6784\u8bc1\u660e\u8de8\u57df\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u53ef\u89e3\u51b3\u827a\u672f\u5bb6\u6838\u5fc3\u75db\u70b9\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f71\u89c6\u53ca\u6e38\u620f\u884c\u4e1a\u63d0\u4f9b\u652f\u6301\u771f\u5b9e\u5149\u7167\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u53ef\u7f16\u8f913D\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u6280\u672f\u3002"}}

In this paper, we present an illuminant personalization method named LumiCtrl that learns an illuminant prompt given a single image of an object. LumiCtrl consists of three basic components: given an image of the object, our method applies (a) physics-based illuminant augmentation along the Planckian locus to create fine-tuning variants under standard illuminants; (b) edge-guided prompt disentanglement using a frozen ControlNet to ensure prompts focus on illumination rather than structure; and (c) a masked reconstruction loss that focuses learning on the foreground object while allowing the background to adapt contextually, enabling what we call contextual light adaptation. We qualitatively and quantitatively compare LumiCtrl against other T2I customization methods. The results show that our method achieves significantly better illuminant fidelity, aesthetic quality, and scene coherence compared to existing personalization baselines.

We introduce the Multi-Modal Landmark dataset (MMLANDMARKS), a benchmark composed of four modalities: 197k highresolution aerial images, 329k ground-view images, textual information, and geographic coordinates for 18,557 distinct landmarks in the United States. The MMLANDMARKS dataset has a one-to-one correspondence across every modality, which enables training and benchmarking models for various geo-spatial tasks, including cross-view Ground-to-Satellite retrieval, ground and satellite geolocalization, Text-to-Image, and Text-to-GPS retrieval.

While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) achieve impressive scores on existing benchmarks, a fundamental question remains: can MLLMs truly ground language in vision with human-like sophistication, or are they merely pattern-matching on simplified datasets? Current benchmarks fail to capture real-world complexity where humans effortlessly navigate ambiguous references and recognize when grounding is impossible. To rigorously assess MLLMs' true capabilities, we introduce GroundingME, a benchmark that systematically challenges models across four critical dimensions: (1) Discriminative, distinguishing highly similar objects, (2) Spatial, understanding complex relational descriptions, (3) Limited, handling occlusions or tiny objects, and (4) Rejection, recognizing ungroundable queries. Through careful curation combining automated generation with human verification, we create 1,005 challenging examples mirroring real-world complexity. Evaluating 25 state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals a profound capability gap: the best model achieves only 45.1% accuracy, while most score 0% on rejection tasks, reflexively hallucinating objects rather than acknowledging their absence, raising critical safety concerns for deployment. We explore two strategies for improvements: (1) test-time scaling selects optimal response by thinking trajectory to improve complex grounding by up to 2.9%, and (2) data-mixture training teaches models to recognize ungroundable queries, boosting rejection accuracy from 0% to 27.9%. GroundingME thus serves as both a diagnostic tool revealing current limitations in MLLMs and a roadmap toward human-level visual grounding.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faGroundingME\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56db\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff08\u533a\u5206\u6027\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6027\u3001\u53d7\u9650\u6027\u548c\u62d2\u7edd\u6027\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u6700\u4f73\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ec545.1%\uff0c\u62d2\u7edd\u4efb\u52a1\u57fa\u672c\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7f29\u653e\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u57fa\u51c6\u65e0\u6cd5\u771f\u5b9e\u53cd\u6620\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bed\u8a00-\u89c6\u89c9\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30MLLMs\u80fd\u5426\u771f\u6b63\u5b9e\u73b0\u7c7b\u4eba\u5316\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u7b80\u5355\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5e94\u5bf9\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u6b67\u4e49\u4e0e\u4e0d\u53ef\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u8986\u76d6\u56db\u79cd\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u7684GroundingME\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff081005\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff09\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd525\u4e2a\u6700\u5148\u8fdbMLLMs\u7684\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8868\u73b0\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7f29\u653e\uff08\u4f18\u5316\u54cd\u5e94\u8def\u5f84\uff09\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u6df7\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08\u5b66\u4e60\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0d\u53ef\u5b9a\u4f4d\u67e5\u8be2\uff09\u4e24\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u9876\u5c16\u6a21\u578b\u603b\u4f53\u51c6\u786e\u738745.1%\uff0c\u62d2\u7edd\u4efb\u52a1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e3a0%\uff08\u591a\u6570\u5e7b\u89c9\u751f\u6210\uff09\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7f29\u653e\u63d0\u5347\u590d\u6742\u5b9a\u4f4d2.9%\uff0c\u6df7\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f7f\u62d2\u7edd\u4efb\u52a1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5347\u81f327.9%\u3002", "conclusion": "GroundingME\u63ed\u793a\u4e86MLLMs\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u7684\u6839\u672c\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u4e0d\u53ef\u5b9a\u4f4d\u58f0\u660e\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u5224\u65ad\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u7c7b\u4eba\u5b9a\u4f4d\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

The performance of pathology AI systems has been almost exclusively evaluated on European and US cohorts from large centers. For global AI adoption in pathology, validation studies on currently under-represented populations - where the potential gains from AI support may also be greatest - are needed. We present the first study with an external validation cohort from the Middle East, focusing on AI-based diagnosis and Gleason grading of prostate cancer.\n  Methods: We collected and digitised 339 prostate biopsy specimens from the Kurdistan region, Iraq, representing a consecutive series of 185 patients spanning the period 2013-2024. We evaluated a task-specific end-to-end AI model and two foundation models in terms of their concordance with pathologists and consistency across samples digitised on three scanner models (Hamamatsu, Leica, and Grundium).\n  Findings: Grading concordance between AI and pathologists was similar to pathologist-pathologist concordance with Cohen's quadratically weighted kappa 0.801 vs. 0.799 (p=0.9824). Cross-scanner concordance was high (quadratically weighted kappa > 0.90) for all AI models and scanner pairs, including low-cost compact scanner.\n  Interpretation: AI models demonstrated pathologist-level performance in prostate histopathology assessment. Compact scanners can provide a route for validation studies in non-digitalised settings and enable cost-effective adoption of AI in laboratories with limited sample volumes. This first openly available digital pathology dataset from the Middle East supports further research into globally equitable AI pathology.\n  Funding: SciLifeLab and Wallenberg Data Driven Life Science Program, Instrumentarium Science Foundation, Karolinska Institutet Research Foundation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86AI\u5728\u4e2d\u4e1c\u4eba\u7fa4\u4e2d\u524d\u5217\u817a\u764c\u75c5\u7406\u8bca\u65ad\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u4e0e\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u5bb6\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u4e14\u517c\u5bb9\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u626b\u63cf\u8bbe\u5907\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3AI\u75c5\u7406\u8bca\u65ad\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e2d\u4e1c\u7b49\u975e\u6b27\u7f8e\u5730\u533a\u6570\u636e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1AI\u5728\u5168\u7403\u5316\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u666e\u9002\u6027\u53ca\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u5730\u533a\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f0a\u62c9\u514b\u5e93\u5c14\u5fb7\u65af\u5766\u7684339\u4f8b\u524d\u5217\u817a\u6d3b\u68c0\u6837\u672c\uff082013-2024\u5e74\uff09\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7aef\u5230\u7aefAI\u6a21\u578b\u53ca\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u764c\u75c7\u8bca\u65ad\u548cGleason\u5206\u7ea7\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30AI\u4e0e\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u5bb6\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u53ca\u5bf9\u4e09\u79cd\u626b\u63cf\u4eea\uff08\u542b\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7d27\u51d1\u578b\uff09\u7684\u8de8\u8bbe\u5907\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u3002", "result": "AI\u4e0e\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u5bb6\u7684\u5206\u7ea7\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff08Kappa=0.801\uff09\u4e0e\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u5bb6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff08Kappa=0.799\uff09\u76f8\u5f53\uff08p=0.9824\uff09\uff1bAI\u8de8\u626b\u63cf\u4eea\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5747\uff1e0.90\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u8bbe\u5907\u3002", "conclusion": "AI\u5728\u4e2d\u4e1c\u4eba\u7fa4\u75c5\u7406\u8bca\u65ad\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u5bb6\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u7d27\u51d1\u578b\u626b\u63cf\u4eea\u652f\u6301\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u5730\u533a\u7684\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u516c\u5f00\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u4e2d\u4e1c\u6570\u5b57\u75c5\u7406\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002"}}

However, domain shift often reduces the detector's ability to maintain strong object-focused representations, causing high-confidence activations over background clutter. This weak object focus results in unreliable pseudo-labels from the detection head. While prior works mainly refine these pseudo-labels, they overlook the underlying need to strengthen the feature space itself. We propose FALCON-SFOD (Foundation-Aligned Learning with Clutter suppression and Noise robustness), a framework designed to enhance object-focused adaptation under domain shift. It consists of two complementary components. SPAR (Spatial Prior-Aware Regularization) leverages the generalization strength of vision foundation models to regularize the detector's feature space.

However, current methods mainly focus on handling humans wearing tight clothing and perform poorly when estimating body shapes and poses under diverse clothing, especially loose garments. To this end, we make two key insights: (1) tailoring clothing to fit the human body can mitigate the adverse impact of clothing on 3D human mesh recovery, and (2) utilizing human visual information from large foundational models can enhance the generalization ability of the estimation. Based on these insights, we propose ClothHMR, to accurately recover 3D meshes of humans in diverse clothing. ClothHMR primarily consists of two modules: clothing tailoring (CT) and FHVM-based mesh recovering (MR). The CT module employs body semantic estimation and body edge prediction to tailor the clothing, ensuring it fits the body silhouette. The MR module optimizes the initial parameters of the 3D human mesh by continuously aligning the intermediate representations of the 3D mesh with those inferred from the foundational human visual model (FHVM). ClothHMR can accurately recover 3D meshes of humans wearing diverse clothing, precisely estimating their body shapes and poses. Experimental results demonstrate that ClothHMR significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across benchmark datasets and in-the-wild images. Additionally, a web application for online fashion and shopping powered by ClothHMR is developed, illustrating that ClothHMR can effectively serve real-world usage scenarios.

However, most prior work extends these networks to predict additional Gaussian parameters -- orientation, scale, opacity, and appearance -- while relying almost exclusively on view-synthesis supervision. We show that a view-synthesis loss alone is insufficient to recover geometrically meaningful splats in this setting. We analyze and address the ambiguities of learning 3D Gaussian splats under self-supervision for pose-free generalizable splatting, and introduce G3Splat, which enforces geometric priors to obtain geometrically consistent 3D scene representations. Trained on RE10K, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in (i) geometrically consistent reconstruction, (ii) relative pose estimation, and (iii) novel-view synthesis.

However, this field remains underexplored due to the scarcity of reproducible benchmarks and the limitations of existing image composition methods in achieving high-fidelity furniture synthesis while preserving background integrity. To overcome these challenges, we first present RoomBench++, a comprehensive and publicly available benchmark dataset tailored for this task. It consists of 112,851 training pairs and 1,832 testing pairs drawn from both real-world indoor videos and realistic home design renderings, thereby supporting robust training and evaluation under practical conditions. Then, we propose RoomEditor++, a versatile diffusion-based architecture featuring a parameter-sharing dual diffusion backbone, which is compatible with both U-Net and DiT architectures. This design unifies the feature extraction and inpainting processes for reference and background images. Our in-depth analysis reveals that the parameter-sharing mechanism enforces aligned feature representations, facilitating precise geometric transformations, texture preservation, and seamless integration. Extensive experiments validate that RoomEditor++ is superior over state-of-the-art approaches in terms of quantitative metrics, qualitative assessments, and human preference studies, while highlighting its strong generalization to unseen indoor scenes and general scenes without task-specific fine-tuning.

While mainstream video SCI using random binary modulation has demonstrated success, it inevitably results in temporal aliasing during compression. One-hot modulation, activating only one sub-frame per pixel, provides a promising solution for achieving perfect temporal decoupling, thereby alleviating issues associated with aliasing. However, no algorithms currently exist to fully exploit this potential. To bridge this gap, we propose an algorithm specifically designed for one-hot masks. First, leveraging the decoupling properties of one-hot modulation, we transform the reconstruction task into a generative video inpainting problem and introduce a stochastic differential equation (SDE) of the forward process that aligns with the hardware compression process. Next, we identify limitations of the pure diffusion method for video SCI and propose a novel framework that combines one-step regression initialization with one-step diffusion refinement. Furthermore, to mitigate the spatial degradation caused by one-hot modulation, we implement a dual optical path at the hardware level, utilizing complementary information from another path to enhance the inpainted video. To our knowledge, this is the first work integrating diffusion into video SCI reconstruction.

To address this question, we conducted a large-scale systematic study of 241 biomedical image analysis challenges comprising 458 tasks across 19 imaging modalities. Our findings show substantial biases in dataset composition, including geographic location, modality-, and problem type-related biases, indicating that current benchmarks do not adequately reflect real-world clinical diversity. Despite their widespread influence, challenge datasets were frequently constrained by restrictive or ambiguous access conditions, inconsistent or non-compliant licensing practices, and incomplete documentation, limiting reproducibility and long-term reuse.

Traditional approaches often rely on extensive labeled data and incur high computational costs. Recent tuning-free methods based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer a promising alternative by leveraging their rich world knowledge. However, these methods typically rely on textual outputs, which introduces information loss, exhibits normalcy bias, and suffers from prompt sensitivity, making them insufficient for capturing subtle anomalous cues. To address these constraints, we propose HeadHunt-VAD, a novel tuning-free VAD paradigm that bypasses textual generation by directly hunting robust anomaly-sensitive internal attention heads within the frozen MLLM. Central to our method is a Robust Head Identification module that systematically evaluates all attention heads using a multi-criteria analysis of saliency and stability, identifying a sparse subset of heads that are consistently discriminative across diverse prompts. Features from these expert heads are then fed into a lightweight anomaly scorer and a temporal locator, enabling efficient and accurate anomaly detection with interpretable outputs.

Sparse query-based 3D detectors efficiently aggregate object-relevant features from multi-view images through a set of learnable queries, offering a concise and end-to-end detection paradigm. Building on this foundation, MV2D leverages 2D detection results to provide high-quality object priors for query initialization, enabling higher precision and recall. However, the inherent depth ambiguity in single-frame 2D detections still limits the accuracy of 3D query generation. To address this issue, we propose StereoMV2D, a unified framework that integrates temporal stereo modeling into the 2D detection-guided multi-view 3D detector. By exploiting cross-temporal disparities of the same object across adjacent frames, StereoMV2D enhances depth perception and refines the query priors, while performing all computations efficiently within 2D regions of interest (RoIs). Furthermore, a dynamic confidence gating mechanism adaptively evaluates the reliability of temporal stereo cues through learning statistical patterns derived from the inter-frame matching matrix together with appearance consistency, ensuring robust detection under object appearance and occlusion.

While recent multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) possess the rich world knowledge required for open-vocabulary understanding, they remain decoupled from existing HOI detectors since fine-tuning them is computationally prohibitive. To address these constraints, we propose \\GRASP-HO}, a novel Generative Reasoning And Steerable Perception framework that reformulates HOI detection from the closed-set classification task to the open-vocabulary generation problem.

Nevertheless, shaping such in-context learning for instruction-based video editing is not trivial. Without specifying editing regions, the results can suffer from the problem of inaccurate editing regions and the token interference between editing and non-editing areas during denoising. To address these, we present ReCo, a new instructional video editing paradigm that novelly delves into constraint modeling between editing and non-editing regions during in-context generation. Technically, ReCo width-wise concatenates source and target video for joint denoising. To calibrate video diffusion learning, ReCo capitalizes on two regularization terms, i.e., latent and attention regularization, conducting on one-step backward denoised latents and attention maps, respectively. The former increases the latent discrepancy of the editing region between source and target videos while reducing that of non-editing areas, emphasizing the modification on editing area and alleviating outside unexpected content generation. The latter suppresses the attention of tokens in the editing region to the tokens in counterpart of the source video, thereby mitigating their interference during novel object generation in target video.

These advances now enable granular and precise quantification of facial expression, head movement, body action, and other behavioral modalities and are increasingly used in psychology, psychiatry, neuroscience, and mental health research. However, mainstream adoption remains slow. Most existing methods and software are developed for engineering audiences, require specialized software stacks, and fail to provide behavioral measurements at a level directly useful for hypothesis-driven research. As a result, there is a large barrier to entry for researchers who wish to use modern, AI-based tools in their work. We introduce Bitbox, an open-source toolkit designed to remove this barrier and make advanced computational analysis directly usable by behavioral scientists and clinical researchers. Bitbox is guided by principles of reproducibility, modularity, and interpretability. It provides a standardized interface for extracting high-level behavioral measurements from video, leveraging multiple face, head, and body processors. The core modules have been tested and validated on clinical samples and are designed so that new measures can be added with minimal effort. Bitbox is intended to serve both sides of the translational gap. It gives behavioral researchers access to robust, high-level behavioral metrics without requiring engineering expertise, and it provides computer scientists a practical mechanism for disseminating methods to domains where their impact is most needed. We expect that Bitbox will accelerate integration of computational behavioral measurement into behavioral, clinical, and mental health research. Bitbox has been designed from the beginning as a community-driven effort that will evolve through contributions from both method developers and domain scientists.", "AI": {"tldr": "Bitbox\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u5de5\u5177\u5305\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u964d\u4f4e\u884c\u4e3a\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u4f7f\u7528AI\u5206\u6790\u89c6\u9891\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u95e8\u69db\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u3001\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u9ad8\u9636\u884c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5316\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u89c6\u9891\u884c\u4e3a\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u9762\u5411\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u76f4\u63a5\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u9ad8\u9636\u884c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u884c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u7528AI\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4fbf\u6377\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faBitbox\u5de5\u5177\u5305\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u67b6\u6784\u6574\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u5668\uff08\u4eba\u8138/\u5934\u90e8/\u8eab\u4f53\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u63a5\u53e3\u8f93\u51fa\u4e34\u5e8a\u7ea7\u884c\u4e3a\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u4e0e\u6613\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6838\u5fc3\u6a21\u5757\u5df2\u5b8c\u6210\u4e34\u5e8a\u6837\u672c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6307\u6807\u6db5\u76d6\u5934\u90e8\u52a8\u4f5c\u3001\u9762\u90e8\u8868\u60c5\u3001\u8eab\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u7b49\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e14\u652f\u6301\u65b0\u6d4b\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u96c6\u6210\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u5177\u67b6\u8d77\u7b97\u6cd5\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u5230\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6865\u6881\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6280\u672f\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u4f7f\u7528\u95e8\u69db\uff0c\u9884\u8ba1\u52a0\u901f\u8ba1\u7b97\u884c\u4e3a\u5206\u6790\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8f6c\u5316\u3002"}}

However, since models must capture both spatial and temporal relationships, performance is limited by the feature representations within a frame but also between multiple frames. We propose the Spatio-Temporal Gaze Network (ST-Gaze), a model that combines a CNN backbone with dedicated channel attention and self-attention modules to fuse eye and face features optimally. The fused features are then treated as a spatial sequence, allowing for the capture of an intra-frame context, which is then propagated through time to model inter-frame dynamics. We evaluated our method on the EVE dataset and show that ST-Gaze achieves state-of-the-art performance both with and without person-specific adaptation. Additionally, our ablation study provides further insights into the model performance, showing that preserving and modelling intra-frame spatial context with our spatio-temporal recurrence is fundamentally superior to premature spatial pooling.

It leverages a transformer-based reconstruction model with structured head query tokens as canonical anchor to aggregate flexible input-number-agnostic, camera-pose-free and expression-free inputs into a robust canonical 3D representation. For detailed dynamic deformation, we introduce a lightweight UNet decoder conditioned on UV-space position maps, which can produce detailed expression-dependent deformations in real time. To better capture rare but critical expressions like wrinkles and bared teeth, we also adopt a data distribution adjustment strategy during training to balance the distribution of these expressions in the training set. Moreover, a lightweight 10-second refinement can further enhances identity-specific details in extreme identities without affecting deformation quality.

However, existing datasets are largely limited to either simulated environments or human-driven vehicle data, lacking authentic ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System) vehicle behavior under risk conditions. To address this gap, this paper introduces SAVeD, a large-scale video dataset curated from publicly available social media content, explicitly focused on ADAS vehicle-related crashes, near-miss incidents, and disengagements. SAVeD features 2,119 first-person videos, capturing ADAS vehicle operations in diverse locations, lighting conditions, and weather scenarios. The dataset includes video frame-level annotations for collisions, evasive maneuvers, and disengagements, enabling analysis of both perception and decision-making failures. We demonstrate SAVeD's utility through multiple analyses and contributions: (1) We propose a novel framework integrating semantic segmentation and monocular depth estimation to compute real-time Time-to-Collision (TTC) for dynamic objects. (2) We utilize the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution to model and quantify the extreme risk in crash and near-miss events across different roadway types.

Multiple instance learning (MIL) offers a solution by treating each WSI as a bag of patch-level instances, but effectively modeling ultra-long sequences with rich spatial context remains difficult. Recently, Mamba has emerged as a promising alternative for long sequence learning, scaling linearly to thousands of tokens. However, despite its efficiency, it still suffers from limited spatial context modeling and memory decay, constraining its effectiveness to WSI analysis. To address these limitations, we propose MambaMIL+, a new MIL framework that explicitly integrates spatial context while maintaining long-range dependency modeling without memory forgetting. Specifically, MambaMIL+ introduces 1) overlapping scanning, which restructures the patch sequence to embed spatial continuity and instance correlations; 2) a selective stripe position encoder (S2PE) that encodes positional information while mitigating the biases of fixed scanning orders; and 3) a contextual token selection (CTS) mechanism, which leverages supervisory knowledge to dynamically enlarge the contextual memory for stable long-range modeling. Extensive experiments on 20 benchmarks across diagnostic classification, molecular prediction, and survival analysis demonstrate that MambaMIL+ consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance under three feature extractors (ResNet-50, PLIP, and CONCH), highlighting its effectiveness and robustness for large-scale computational pathology", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86MambaMIL+\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e0e\u957f\u7a0b\u4f9d\u8d56\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5168\u5207\u7247\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5168\u5207\u7247\u56fe\u50cf\uff08WSI\uff09\u7684\u5343\u5146\u50cf\u7d20\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6ce8\u91ca\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u3002MIL\u6846\u67b6\u5df2\u88ab\u7528\u4e8e\u5904\u7406WSI\uff0c\u4f46\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u4ecd\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u7a7a\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u8870\u51cf\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "1) \u91cd\u53e0\u626b\u63cf\u91cd\u6784\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5e8f\u5217\u4ee5\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\uff1b2) \u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6761\u7eb9\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08S2PE\uff09\u7f13\u89e3\u626b\u63cf\u987a\u5e8f\u504f\u7f6e\uff1b3) \u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4ee4\u724c\u9009\u62e9\u673a\u5236\uff08CTS\uff09\u52a8\u6001\u6269\u5c55\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5bb9\u91cf\u4ee5\u7a33\u5b9a\u5efa\u6a21\u957f\u7a0b\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u572820\u4e2a\u8bca\u65ad\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u5206\u5b50\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u751f\u5b58\u5206\u6790\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eResNet-50/PLIP/CONCH\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\u5747\u53d6\u5f97SOTA\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "MambaMIL+\u901a\u8fc7\u7a7a\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u4f18\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u75c5\u7406\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8ba1\u7b97\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

A key challenge is generalization, as detectors trained on a narrow class of generators often fail when confronted with unseen models. In this work, we address the pressing need for generalizable detection by leveraging large vision-language models, specifically CLIP, to identify synthetic content across diverse generative techniques. First, we introduce Diff-Gen, a large-scale benchmark dataset comprising 100k diffusion-generated fakes that capture broad spectral artifacts unlike traditional GAN datasets. Models trained on Diff-Gen demonstrate stronger cross-domain generalization, particularly on previously unseen image generators. Second, we propose AdaptPrompt, a parameter-efficient transfer learning framework that jointly learns task-specific textual prompts and visual adapters while keeping the CLIP backbone frozen. We further show via layer ablation that pruning the final transformer block of the vision encoder enhances the retention of high-frequency generative artifacts, significantly boosting detection accuracy. Our evaluation spans 25 challenging test sets, covering synthetic content generated by GANs, diffusion models, and commercial tools, establishing a new state-of-the-art in both standard and cross-domain scenarios.

However, cloud contamination frequently obscures LST observations, limiting their usability for continuous SUHI analysis. Most existing LST reconstruction methods rely on multitemporal information or multisensor data fusion, requiring auxiliary observations that may be unavailable or unreliable under persistent cloud cover. Purely spatial gap-filling approaches offer an alternative, but traditional statistical methods degrade under large or spatially contiguous gaps, while many deep learning based spatial models deteriorate rapidly with increasing missingness.\n  Recent advances in denoising diffusion based image inpainting models have demonstrated improved robustness under high missingness, motivating their adoption for spatial LST reconstruction. In this work, we introduce UrbanDIFF, a purely spatial denoising diffusion model for reconstructing cloud contaminated urban LST imagery. The model is conditioned on static urban structure information, including built-up surface data and a digital elevation model, and enforces strict consistency with revealed cloud free pixels through a supervised pixel guided refinement step during inference.\n  UrbanDIFF is trained and evaluated using NASA MODIS Terra LST data from seven major United States metropolitan areas spanning 2002 to 2025. Experiments using synthetic cloud masks with 20 to 85 percent coverage show that UrbanDIFF consistently outperforms an interpolation baseline, particularly under dense cloud occlusion, achieving SSIM of 0.89, RMSE of 1.2 K, and R2 of 0.84 at 85 percent cloud coverage, while exhibiting slower performance degradation as cloud density increases.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faUrbanDIFF\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u53bb\u566a\u6269\u6563\u7684\u7eaf\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u57ce\u5e02\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u4e91\u63a9\u819c\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9ad8\u4e91\u8986\u76d6\u4e0b\u7684\u5730\u8868\u6e29\u5ea6\uff08LST\uff09\u91cd\u5efa\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u536b\u661fLST\u4ea7\u54c1\u5728\u57ce\u5e02\u70ed\u5c9b\u76d1\u6d4b\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u4e91\u5c42\u6c61\u67d3\u5e38\u5bfc\u81f4\u6570\u636e\u7f3a\u5931\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u591a\u65f6\u76f8\u6216\u591a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6216\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7f3a\u5931\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u7a7a\u95f4\u91cd\u5efa\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "UrbanDIFF\u91c7\u7528\u6269\u6563\u56fe\u50cf\u4fee\u590d\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4ee5\u5efa\u6210\u533a\u6570\u636e\u548c\u6570\u5b57\u9ad8\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u76d1\u7763\u7ec6\u5316\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u91cd\u5efa\u533a\u57df\u4e0e\u65e0\u4e91\u50cf\u7d20\u4e25\u683c\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "result": "\u5728NASA MODIS LST\u6570\u636e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cUrbanDIFF\u572885%\u4e91\u8986\u76d6\u4e0b\u8fbe\u52300.89 SSIM\u30011.2K RMSE\u30010.84 R2\uff0c\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u8870\u51cf\u901f\u5ea6\u663e\u8457\u6162\u4e8e\u63d2\u503c\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "UrbanDIFF\u901a\u8fc7\u7eaf\u7a7a\u95f4\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u4e91\u6c61\u67d3\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u57ce\u5e02\u70ed\u73af\u5883\u8fde\u7eed\u76d1\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6280\u672f\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

In this work, we introduce AniX, leveraging the realism and structural grounding of static world generation while extending controllable-entity models to support user-specified characters capable of performing open-ended actions. Users can provide a 3DGS scene and a character, then direct the character through natural language to perform diverse behaviors from basic locomotion to object-centric interactions while freely exploring the environment. AniX synthesizes temporally coherent video clips that preserve visual fidelity with the provided scene and character, formulated as a conditional autoregressive video generation problem. Built upon a pre-trained video generator, our training strategy significantly enhances motion dynamics while maintaining generalization across actions and characters.

We address this gap by introducing Chorus, a multi-teacher pretraining framework that learns a holistic feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) scene encoder by distilling complementary signals from 2D foundation models. Chorus employs a shared 3D encoder and teacher-specific projectors to learn from language-aligned, generalist, and object-aware teachers, encouraging a shared embedding space that captures signals from high-level semantics to fine-grained structure.\n  We evaluate Chorus on a wide range of tasks: open-vocabulary semantic and instance segmentation, linear and decoder probing, as well as data-efficient supervision. Besides 3DGS, we also test Chorus on several benchmarks that only support point clouds by pretraining a variant using only Gaussians' centers, colors, estimated normals as inputs. Interestingly, this encoder shows strong transfer and outperforms the point clouds baseline while using 39.9 times fewer training scenes.

However, the fundamental design choice of diffusing data all the way to white noise and then reconstructing it leads to an extremely difficult and computationally intractable prediction task. To overcome this limitation, we propose InSPECT (Invariant Spectral Feature-Preserving Diffusion Model), a novel diffusion model that keeps invariant spectral features during both the forward and backward processes. At the end of the forward process, the Fourier coefficients smoothly converge to a specified random noise, enabling features preservation while maintaining diversity and randomness. By preserving invariant features, InSPECT demonstrates enhanced visual diversity, faster convergence rate, and a smoother diffusion process. Experiments on CIFAR-10, Celeb-A, and LSUN demonstrate that InSPECT achieves on average a 39.23% reduction in FID and 45.80% improvement in IS against DDPM for 10K iterations under specified parameter settings, which demonstrates the significant advantages of preserving invariant features: achieving superior generation quality and diversity, while enhancing computational efficiency and enabling faster convergence rate.

Recent benchmarks such as BLINK probe visual perception through visual prompting, where questions about visual content are paired with coordinates to which the question refers, with the coordinates explicitly marked in the image itself. While these benchmarks are an important part of VLM evaluation, we find that existing models are surprisingly fragile to seemingly irrelevant details of visual prompting: simply changing a visual marker from red to blue can completely change rankings among models on a leaderboard. By evaluating nine commonly-used open- and closed-source VLMs on two visually prompted tasks, we demonstrate how details in benchmark setup, including visual marker design and dataset size, have a significant influence on model performance and leaderboard rankings. These effects can even be exploited to lift weaker models above stronger ones; for instance, slightly increasing the size of the visual marker results in open-source InternVL3-8B ranking alongside or better than much larger proprietary models like Gemini 2.5 Pro. We further show that low-level inference choices that are often ignored in benchmarking, such as JPEG compression levels in API calls, can also cause model lineup changes. These details have substantially larger impacts on visually prompted benchmarks than on conventional semantic VLM evaluations.

With the advance of general purpose foundation models based on Vision Transformers (ViTs), this impracticability becomes even more problematic. Therefore, new methods are necessary to provide transparency and reliability to ViT-based foundation models. In this work, we present a new method for turning any well-trained ViT-based model into a SEM without retraining, which we call Keypoint Counting Classifiers (KCCs).

While humans naturally coordinate in groups, modeling such interactions remains difficult due to long temporal horizons, strong inter-agent dependencies, and variable group sizes. Existing motion generation methods are largely task-specific and do not generalize to flexible multi-agent generation. We introduce MAGNet (Multi-Agent Diffusion Forcing Transformer), a unified autoregressive diffusion framework for multi-agent motion generation that supports a wide range of interaction tasks through flexible conditioning and sampling. MAGNet performs dyadic prediction, partner inpainting, and full multi-agent motion generation within a single model, and can autoregressively generate ultra-long sequences spanning hundreds of v. Building on Diffusion Forcing, we introduce key modifications that explicitly model inter-agent coupling during autoregressive denoising, enabling coherent coordination across agents. As a result, MAGNet captures both tightly synchronized activities (e.g, dancing, boxing) and loosely structured social interactions. Our approach performs on par with specialized methods on dyadic benchmarks while naturally extending to polyadic scenarios involving three or more interacting people, enabled by a scalable architecture that is agnostic to the number of agents. We refer readers to the supplemental video, where the temporal dynamics and spatial coordination of generated interactions are best appreciated.

This paper thus investigates the adversarial robustness of LLaVA-1.5-13B and Meta's Llama 3.2 Vision-8B-2. These are tested for untargeted PGD (Projected Gradient Descent) against the visual input modality, and empirically evaluated on the Visual Question Answering (VQA) v2 dataset subset. The results of these adversarial attacks are then quantified using the standard VQA accuracy metric. This evaluation is then compared with the accuracy degradation (accuracy drop) of LLaVA and Llama 3.2 Vision. A key finding is that Llama 3.2 Vision, despite a lower baseline accuracy in this setup, exhibited a smaller drop in performance under attack compared to LLaVA, particularly at higher perturbation levels. Overall, the findings confirm that the vision modality represents a viable attack vector for degrading the performance of contemporary open-weight VLMs, including Meta's Llama 3.2 Vision.

However, current digital twins remain largely static and are limited to navigation and view synthesis without embodied interactivity. To bridge this gap, we introduce Dexterous World Model (DWM), a scene-action-conditioned video diffusion framework that models how dexterous human actions induce dynamic changes in static 3D scenes.\n  Given a static 3D scene rendering and an egocentric hand motion sequence, DWM generates temporally coherent videos depicting plausible human-scene interactions. Our approach conditions video generation on (1) static scene renderings following a specified camera trajectory to ensure spatial consistency, and (2) egocentric hand mesh renderings that encode both geometry and motion cues to model action-conditioned dynamics directly. To train DWM, we construct a hybrid interaction video dataset. Synthetic egocentric interactions provide fully aligned supervision for joint locomotion and manipulation learning, while fixed-camera real-world videos contribute diverse and realistic object dynamics.\n  Experiments demonstrate that DWM enables realistic and physically plausible interactions, such as grasping, opening, and moving objects, while maintaining camera and scene consistency. This framework represents a first step toward video diffusion-based interactive digital twins and enables embodied simulation from egocentric actions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faDexterous World Model (DWM)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u9759\u60013D\u573a\u666f\u6e32\u67d3\u548c\u81ea\u6211\u4e2d\u5fc3\u624b\u90e8\u52a8\u4f5c\u5e8f\u5217\u751f\u6210\u52a8\u6001\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u3002\u5229\u7528\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u652f\u6301\u73b0\u5b9e\u5408\u7406\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u4e92\u52a8\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u7075\u5de7\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e0e\u573a\u666f\u52a8\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u586b\u8865\u9759\u6001\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u573a\u666f-\u52a8\u4f5c\u6761\u4ef6\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1a1) \u9759\u6001\u573a\u666f\u6e32\u67d3\u914d\u5408\u9884\u8bbe\u76f8\u673a\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c2) \u624b\u90e8\u51e0\u4f55\u8fd0\u52a8\u4fe1\u606f\u5d4c\u5165\u3002\u6784\u5efa\u6df7\u5408\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u751f\u6210\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5b9e\u73b0\u6293\u53d6\u3001\u5f00\u95e8\u7b49\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u573a\u666f\u7ed3\u6784\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "DWM\u5f00\u521b\u6027\u5730\u5c06\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u52a8\u4f5c\u89e6\u53d1\u7684\u573a\u666f\u52a8\u6001\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u6211\u4e2d\u5fc3\u52a8\u4f5c\u9a71\u52a8\u865a\u62df\u73af\u5883\u4e92\u52a8\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

We introduce Re-Depth Anything, a test-time self-supervision framework that bridges this domain gap by fusing DA-V2 with the powerful priors of large-scale 2D diffusion models. Our method performs label-free refinement directly on the input image by re-lighting predicted depth maps and augmenting the input. This re-synthesis method replaces classical photometric reconstruction by leveraging shape from shading (SfS) cues in a new, generative context with Score Distillation Sampling (SDS). To prevent optimization collapse, our framework employs a targeted optimization strategy: rather than optimizing depth directly or fine-tuning the full model, we freeze the encoder and only update intermediate embeddings while also fine-tuning the decoder. Across diverse benchmarks, Re-Depth Anything yields substantial gains in depth accuracy and realism over the DA-V2, showcasing new avenues for self-supervision by augmenting geometric reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aRe-Depth Anything\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408Depth Anything V2\uff08DA-V2\uff09\u548c\u5927\u89c4\u6a212D\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u586b\u8865\u9886\u57df\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u5355\u76ee\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5355\u76ee\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u4ecd\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u76ee\u524d\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982Depth Anything V2\uff0cDA-V2\uff09\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u5dee\u5f02\u8f83\u5927\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u56fe\u50cf\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u56fe\u50cf\u8fdb\u884c\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eDA-V2\u91cd\u65b0\u5bf9\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u8fdb\u884c\u91cd\u65b0\u7167\u660e\u548c\u8f93\u5165\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u65b0\u7684\u751f\u6210\u60c5\u5883\u4e2d\u5229\u7528\u5f97\u5206\u84b8\u998f\u91c7\u6837\uff08Score Distillation Sampling\uff0cSDS\uff09\u53d1\u6325\u5f62\u72b6\u6765\u81ea\u9634\u5f71\uff08Shape from Shading\uff0cSfS\uff09\u7ebf\u7d22\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u907f\u514d\u4f18\u5316\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u91c7\u7528\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u51bb\u7ed3\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u4ec5\u66f4\u65b0\u4e2d\u95f4\u5d4c\u5165\u5e76\u5fae\u8c03\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u76f4\u63a5\u4f18\u5316\u6df1\u5ea6\u6216\u5bf9\u6574\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cRe-Depth Anything\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u5927\u5e45\u4f18\u4e8eDA-V2\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u5f3a\u51e0\u4f55\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u5168\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

To unify vision generation and understanding, a burgeoning trend is to adopt high-dimensional features from representation encoders as generative latents. However, we empirically identify two fundamental obstacles in this paradigm: (1) the discriminative feature space lacks compact regularization, making diffusion models prone to off-manifold latents that lead to inaccurate object structures; and (2) the encoder's inherently weak pixel-level reconstruction hinders the generator from learning accurate fine-grained geometry and texture. In this paper, we propose a systematic framework to adapt understanding-oriented encoder features for generative tasks. We introduce a semantic-pixel reconstruction objective to regularize the latent space, enabling the compression of both semantic information and fine-grained details into a highly compact representation (96 channels with 16x16 spatial downsampling). This design ensures that the latent space remains semantically rich and achieves state-of-the-art image reconstruction, while remaining compact enough for accurate generation. Leveraging this representation, we design a unified Text-to-Image (T2I) and image editing model. Benchmarking against various feature spaces, we demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction, faster convergence, and substantial performance gains in both T2I and editing tasks, validating that representation encoders can be effectively adapted into robust generative components.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8868\u793a\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6539\u5584\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u8bed\u4e49-\u50cf\u7d20\u91cd\u5efa\u76ee\u6807\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u9690\u7a7a\u95f4\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u4e0e\u50cf\u7d20\u91cd\u5efa\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u5f53\u524d\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u91cd\u5efa\u7684VAE\u9690\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0e\u8868\u793a\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u5728\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u7edf\u4e00\u89c6\u89c9\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "1) \u63d0\u51fa\u8bed\u4e49-\u50cf\u7d20\u8054\u5408\u91cd\u5efa\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u4fdd\u7559\uff08\u9ad8\u5c42\u8bed\u4e49\uff09\u4e0e\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u7ec6\u8282\uff08\u4f4e\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff09\uff1b2) \u8bbe\u8ba1\u9ad8\u7d27\u51d1\u9690\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0896\u901a\u9053\uff0c16\u00d716\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\uff1b3) \u6784\u5efa\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "result": "1) \u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u9762\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\uff1b2) \u8bad\u7ec3\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff1b3) \u5728\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5747\u5c55\u73b0\u6027\u80fd\u7a81\u7834\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u9690\u7a7a\u95f4\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u8868\u793a\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u80fd\u591f\u6210\u529f\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}
