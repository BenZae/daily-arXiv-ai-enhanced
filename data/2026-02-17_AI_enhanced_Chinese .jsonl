However, common pseudo-label selection heuristics are largely text-centric (e.g., perplexity (PPL) filtering) and can prefer fluent yet acoustically mismatched hypotheses, leading to error amplification when fine-tuning. To address this, we introduce a multimodal consistency-guided, reference-free data selection pipeline for ASR accent adaptation under a transductive, label-free protocol. The pipeline starts with a target-aware preselection step based on submodular mutual information to improve query relevance and reduce downstream computation. It then generates multiple pseudo-transcriptions per utterance via perturbation-based decoding and scores each hypothesis using two reference-free signals: speech--text alignment in a shared embedding space and predicted word error rate (WER). A simple percentile-based selection rule retains reliable pseudo-labels for fine-tuning while discarding noisy utterances. In an in-domain setting, selecting ~1.5k utterances from a 30k pool achieves 10.91% WER, close to 10.45% obtained using 30k supervised labels. In a cross-domain setting with a mismatched candidate pool, consistency-filtered subsets avoid the degradation caused by unfiltered pseudo-labels under strong accent shift, and matched-hour experiments on a stronger ASR backbone further confirm gains over random sampling and recent selection baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u53c2\u8003\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684ASR\u53e3\u97f3\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u97f3-\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u8bed\u97f3\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5728\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6587\u672c\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u7b49\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u5728\u8bed\u97f3-\u6587\u672c\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u9519\u8bef\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5fae\u8c03\u6548\u679c\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b\u76ee\u6807\u611f\u77e5\u9884\u7b5b\u9009\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b21\u6a21\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\uff09\u3001\u6270\u52a8\u89e3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u591a\u5047\u8bbe\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u65e0\u53c2\u8003\u8bc4\u5206\uff08\u5171\u4eab\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u5ea6+WER\u9884\u6d4b\uff09\u548c\u767e\u5206\u4f4d\u7b5b\u9009\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7ba1\u7ebf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u9886\u57df\u5185\u573a\u666f\u4e2d1.5k\u6837\u672c\u8fbe\u523010.91% WER\uff08\u4ec5\u6bd4\u5168\u76d1\u7763\u4f4e0.36%\uff09\uff0c\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u573a\u666f\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7b5b\u9009\u53ef\u907f\u514d\u6027\u80fd\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u5728\u5f3a\u53e3\u97f3\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u6700\u65b0\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6807\u6ce8\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u53e3\u97f3\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5019\u9009\u6c60\u5b58\u5728\u9886\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u7684\u6311\u6218\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272"}}

We find that language model embeddings typically contain relatively little input information regardless of data and compute scale during training. In contrast, embeddings from autoencoders trained for input regeneration are capable of nearly perfect memory formation. The substitution of memory embeddings for token sequences leads to substantial computational efficiencies, motivating the introduction of a parallelizable encoder-decoder memory model architecture. Upon causal training these models contain information-poor embeddings incapable of arbitrary information access, but by combining causal and information retention objective functions they learn to form and decode information-rich memories. Training can be further streamlined by freezing a high fidelity encoder followed by a curriculum training approach where decoders first learn to process memories and then learn to additionally predict next tokens.

While computational studies have begun to quantify this phenomenon in English-language outlets, no empirical investigation exists for Turkish news media, where existing research remains limited to qualitative interviews with journalists or fake news detection. This study addresses that gap by fine-tuning a Turkish-specific BERT model (dbmdz/bert-base-turkish-cased) on a labeled dataset of 3,600 articles from three major Turkish outlets with distinct editorial orientations for binary classification of AI-rewritten content.

However, the tension between the limited communication bandwidth and the rich sensor information hinders its practical deployment. Recent studies have explored selection strategies that share only a subset of features per frame while striving to keep the performance on par. Nevertheless, the bandwidth requirement still stresses current wireless technologies. To fundamentally ease the tension, we take a proactive approach, exploiting the temporal continuity to identify features that capture environment dynamics, while avoiding repetitive and redundant transmission of static information. By incorporating temporal awareness, agents are empowered to dynamically adapt the sharing quantity according to environment complexity. We instantiate this intuition into an adaptive selection framework, COOPERTRIM, which introduces a novel conformal temporal uncertainty metric to gauge feature relevance, and a data-driven mechanism to dynamically determine the sharing quantity. To evaluate COOPERTRIM, we take semantic segmentation and 3D detection as example tasks. Across multiple open-source cooperative segmentation and detection models, COOPERTRIM achieves up to 80.28% and 72.52% bandwidth reduction respectively while maintaining a comparable accuracy. Relative to other selection strategies, COOPERTRIM also improves IoU by as much as 45.54% with up to 72% less bandwidth. Combined with compression strategies, COOPERTRIM can further reduce bandwidth usage to as low as 1.46% without compromising IoU performance.

We show that this mismatch results from the stochastic nature of modern LLM decoding, under which single-response correctness fails to reflect underlying model capability.

However, the dominant LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm relies on the strong reasoning capabilities of large models, while alternative approaches require reference responses or explicit rubrics, limiting flexibility and broader accessibility. In this work, we propose FLIP (FLipped Inference for Prompt reconstruction), a reference-free and rubric-free reward modeling approach that reformulates reward modeling through backward inference: inferring the instruction that would most plausibly produce a given response. The similarity between the inferred and the original instructions is then used as the reward signal. Evaluations across four domains using 13 small language models show that FLIP outperforms LLM-as-a-Judge baselines by an average of 79.6%. Moreover, FLIP substantially improves downstream performance in extrinsic evaluations under test-time scaling via parallel sampling and GRPO training.

These risks range from localized physical patches to imperceptible global perturbations. Existing defense methods for VLMs remain limited and often fail to reconcile robustness with clean-sample performance. To bridge these gaps, we propose NutVLM, a comprehensive self-adaptive defense framework designed to secure the entire perception-decision lifecycle. Specifically, we first employ NutNet++ as a sentinel, which is a unified detection-purification mechanism. It identifies benign samples, local patches, and global perturbations through three-way classification. Subsequently, localized threats are purified via efficient grayscale masking, while global perturbations trigger Expert-guided Adversarial Prompt Tuning (EAPT). Instead of the costly parameter updates of full-model fine-tuning, EAPT generates \"corrective driving prompts\" via gradient-based latent optimization and discrete projection. These prompts refocus the VLM's attention without requiring exhaustive full-model retraining. Evaluated on the Dolphins benchmark, our NutVLM yields a 4.89% improvement in overall metrics (e.g., Accuracy, Language Score, and GPT Score). These results validate NutVLM as a scalable security solution for intelligent transportation.

We propose VisPhyWorld, an execution-based framework that evaluates physical reasoning by requiring models to generate executable simulator code from visual observations. By producing runnable code, the inferred world representation is directly inspectable, editable, and falsifiable. This separates physical reasoning from rendering. Building on this framework, we introduce VisPhyBench, comprising 209 evaluation scenes derived from 108 physical templates and a systematic protocol that evaluates how well models reconstruct appearance and reproduce physically plausible motion.

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) addresses this by integrating external knowledge, but its efficacy depends on accurate document retrieval and ranking. Although existing rerankers demonstrate effectiveness, they frequently necessitate specialized training, impose substantial computational expenses, and fail to fully exploit the semantic capabilities of LLMs, particularly their inherent confidence signals. We propose the LLM-Confidence Reranker (LCR), a training-free, plug-and-play algorithm that enhances reranking in RAG systems by leveraging black-box LLM confidence derived from Maximum Semantic Cluster Proportion (MSCP). LCR employs a two-stage process: confidence assessment via multinomial sampling and clustering, followed by binning and multi-level sorting based on query and document confidence thresholds. This approach prioritizes relevant documents while preserving original rankings for high-confidence queries, ensuring robustness. Evaluated on BEIR and TREC benchmarks with BM25 and Contriever retrievers, LCR--using only 7--9B-parameter pre-trained LLMs--consistently improves NDCG@5 by up to 20.6% across pre-trained LLM and fine-tuned Transformer rerankers, without degradation.

With the interest in classifying models using HRRP, filling gaps in datasets using generative models has recently received promising contributions. Evaluating generated data is a challenging topic, even for explicit data like face images. However, the evaluation methods used in the state-ofthe-art of HRRP generation rely on classification models. Such models, called ''black-box'', do not allow either explainability on generated data or multi-level evaluation. This work focuses on decomposing HRRP data into three components: the mask, the features, and the noise.

While LLMs can detect surface-level similarity, they often fail to capture the pragmatic functions of rephrasing, such as its role within rhetorical discourse. This paper presents a comparative multi-agent framework designed to quantify the benefits of incorporating explicit theoretical knowledge for this task. We utilise an dataset of annotated political debates to establish a new standard encompassing four distinct rephrase functions: Deintensification, Intensification, Specification, Generalisation, and Other, which covers all remaining types (D-I-S-G-O). We then evaluate two parallel LLM-based agent systems: one enhanced by argumentation theory via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and an identical zero-shot baseline. The results reveal a clear performance gap: the RAG-enhanced agents substantially outperform the baseline across the board, with particularly strong advantages in detecting Intensification and Generalisation context, yielding an overall Macro F1-score improvement of nearly 30\\%. Our findings provide evidence that theoretical grounding is not only beneficial but essential for advancing beyond mere paraphrase detection towards function-aware analysis of argumentative discourse.

Magnetic resonance urography (MRU) can visualize hydronephrosis, including renal pelvis and calyces, by utilizing the natural contrast provided by water. Existing voxel-based segmentation approaches can extract CH regions from MRU, facilitating disease diagnosis and prognosis. However, these segmentation methods predominantly focus on morphological features, such as size, shape, and structure. To enable functional assessments, such as urodynamic simulations, external complex post-processing steps are required to convert these results into mesh-level representations. To address this limitation, we propose an end-to-end method based on deep neural networks, namely KidMesh, which could automatically reconstruct CH meshes directly from MRU. Generally, KidMesh extracts feature maps from MRU images and converts them into feature vertices through grid sampling. It then deforms a template mesh according to these feature vertices to generate the specific CH meshes of MRU images. Meanwhile, we develop a novel schema to train KidMesh without relying on accurate mesh-level annotations, which are difficult to obtain due to the sparsely sampled MRU slices. Experimental results show that KidMesh could reconstruct CH meshes in an average of 0.4 seconds, and achieve comparable performance to conventional methods without requiring post-processing.

It requires grounding event semantics across different modalities. Progress in MEE is limited by the lack of annotated training data. M2E2 is the only established benchmark, but it provides annotations only for evaluation. This makes direct supervised training impractical. Existing methods mainly rely on cross-modal alignment or inference-time prompting with Vision--Language Models (VLMs). These approaches do not explicitly learn structured event representations and often produce weak argument grounding in multimodal settings. To address these limitations, we propose RMPL, a Relation-aware Multi-task Progressive Learning framework for MEE under low-resource conditions. RMPL incorporates heterogeneous supervision from unimodal event extraction and multimedia relation extraction with stage-wise training. The model is first trained with a unified schema to learn shared event-centric representations across modalities. It is then fine-tuned for event mention identification and argument role extraction using mixed textual and visual data. Experiments on the M2E2 benchmark with multiple VLMs show consistent improvements across different modality settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faRMPL\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0b\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4e8b\u4ef6\u62bd\u53d6\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u4e8b\u4ef6\u62bd\u53d6\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5173\u7cfb\u62bd\u53d6\u7684\u5f02\u6784\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b66\u4e60\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5171\u4eab\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u5728M2E2\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709MEE\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u532e\u4e4f\uff08\u4ec5M2E2\u57fa\u51c6\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u6ce8\uff09\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u76d1\u7763\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u6216\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4e8b\u4ef6\u8868\u793a\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bba\u636e\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u5f31\u3002", "method": "RMPL\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a1) \u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u6a21\u5f0f\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u6001\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8868\u793a\uff1b2) \u5728\u6df7\u5408\u56fe\u6587\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03\u4e8b\u4ef6\u63d0\u53ca\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u89d2\u8272\u62bd\u53d6\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u4e8b\u4ef6\u62bd\u53d6\u4e0e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5173\u7cfb\u62bd\u53d6\u7684\u5f02\u6784\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\u5b9e\u73b0\u6e10\u8fdb\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5728M2E2\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982CLIP\u3001BLIP\uff09\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff1a\u76f8\u8f83\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u4e8b\u4ef6\u8bc6\u522bF1\u503c\u63d0\u53473.2-8.7\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\uff08\u56fe\u6587\uff09\u3001\u5355\u6a21\u6001\uff08\u6587\u672c/\u56fe\u50cf\uff09\u573a\u666f\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "RMPL\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4e8b\u4ef6\u62bd\u53d6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5176\u521b\u65b0\u70b9\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1) \u6574\u5408\u5f02\u6784\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1b2) \u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff1b3) \u652f\u6301\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u67b6\u6784\u3002\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u539f\u578b\u3002"}}

However, such manual ordering design can inevitably cause information loss and cumulative errors, lacking flexible and diverse relation modeling among different modules and sensors. Meanwhile, insufficient training of image backbone and quadratic-complexity of attention mechanism also hinder the scalability and efficiency of E2E-AD system to handle spatiotemporal input. To this end, we propose DriveMamba, a Task-Centric Scalable paradigm for efficient E2E-AD, which integrates dynamic task relation modeling, implicit view correspondence learning and long-term temporal fusion into a single-stage Unified Mamba decoder. Specifically, both extracted image features and expected task outputs are converted into token-level sparse representations in advance, which are then sorted by their instantiated positions in 3D space. The linear-complexity operator enables efficient long-context sequential token modeling to capture task-related inter-dependencies simultaneously. Additionally, a bidirectional trajectory-guided \"local-to-global\" scan method is designed to preserve spatial locality from ego-perspective, thus facilitating the ego-planning.

A usage-based approach examining how word senses map to signs can identify such novel mappings absent from current dictionaries, enriching lexicographic resources. We address this by analyzing German and German Sign Language (Deutsche Geb\u00e4rdensprache, DGS), manually annotating 1,404 word use-to-sign ID mappings derived from 32 words from the German Word Usage Graph (D-WUG) and 49 signs from the Digital Dictionary of German Sign Language (DW-DGS). We identify three correspondence types: Type 1 (one-to-many), Type 2 (many-to-one), and Type 3 (one-to-one), plus No Match cases. We evaluate computational methods: Exact Match (EM) and Semantic Similarity (SS) using SBERT embeddings.

However, we demonstrate through an extensive analysis that standard deterministic inversion (e.g. DDIM) fails when the source domain is spectrally sparse compared to the target domain (e.g., super-resolution, sketch-to-image). In these contexts, the recovered latent from the input does not follow the expected isotropic Gaussian distribution. Instead it exhibits a signal with lower frequencies, locking target sampling to oversmoothed and texture-poor generations. We term this phenomenon spectral collapse. We observe that stochastic alternatives attempting to restore the noise variance tend to break the semantic link to the input, leading to structural drift. To resolve this structure-texture trade-off, we propose Orthogonal Variance Guidance (OVG), an inference-time method that corrects the ODE dynamics to enforce the theoretical Gaussian noise magnitude within the null-space of the structural gradient. Extensive experiments on microscopy super-resolution (BBBC021) and sketch-to-image (Edges2Shoes) demonstrate that OVG effectively restores photorealistic textures while preserving structural fidelity.", "AI": {"tldr": "Conditional diffusion inversion struggles with high-quality image synthesis when translating from spectrally sparse domains (like sketches) to richer targets.

In prospective multicentre evaluation (59 patients), OMGs demonstrated high concordance with routine MDT decisions. Critically, in paired human-AI studies, OMGs most substantially enhanced clinicians' recommendations in Evidence and Robustness, the dimensions most compromised when multidisciplinary expertise is unavailable.

Early detection is critical, yet satellite-based monitoring remains challenging due to faint smoke signals, dynamic weather conditions, and the need for real-time analysis over large areas. We introduce WildfireVLM, an AI framework that combines satellite imagery wildfire detection with language-driven risk assessment. We construct a labeled wildfire and smoke dataset using imagery from Landsat-8/9, GOES-16, and other publicly available Earth observation sources, including harmonized products with aligned spectral bands. WildfireVLM employs YOLOv12 to detect fire zones and smoke plumes, leveraging its ability to detect small, complex patterns in satellite imagery.

However, they still struggle to comprehend and respond to the true user needs when intentions and instructions are imprecisely conveyed, leading to a divergence between subjective user believes and true environment states. Resolving this epistemic divergence requires Theory of Mind (ToM), yet existing ToM evaluations for LLMs primarily focus on isolated belief inference, overlooking its functional utility in real-world interaction. To this end, we formalize ToM for LLMs as a mechanism for epistemic divergence detection and resolution, and propose a benchmark, \\benchname, to assess how models reconcile user beliefs and profiles in practice. Results across 11 leading models reveal a significant limitation to identify underlying cognitive gaps that impede task success. To bridge this gap, we further curate a trajectory-based ToM dataset linking belief tracking with task-related state inference. The model trained on this data via reinforcement learning shows consistent improvement in reasoning about user mental states, leading to enhanced downstream performance.

We propose a framework for automated creativity assessment of human paintings by fine-tuning the vision-language model Qwen2-VL-7B with multi-task learning. Our dataset contains 1000 human-created paintings scored on a 1-100 scale and paired with a short human-written description (content or artist explanation). Two expert raters evaluated each work using a five-dimension rubric (originality, color, texture, composition, content) and provided written critiques; we use an 80/20 train-test split. We add a lightweight regression head on the visual encoder output so the model can predict a numerical score and generate rubric-aligned feedback in a single forward pass. By embedding the structured rubric and the artwork description in the system prompt, we constrain the generated text to match the quantitative prediction. Experiments show strong accuracy, achieving Pearson r > 0.97 and MAE about 3.95 on the 100-point scale.

This relies upon a small draft model, tasked with predicting the outputs of the target model. State-of-the-art speculative decoding methods use a draft model consisting of a single decoder layer and output embedding matrix, with the latter dominating drafting time for the latest LMs. Recent work has sought to address this output distribution bottleneck by reducing the vocabulary of the draft model. Although this can improve throughput, it compromises speculation effectiveness when the target token is out-of-vocabulary. In this paper, we argue for vocabulary speculation as an alternative to a reduced vocabulary. We propose SpecVocab, an efficient and effective method that selects a vocabulary subset per decoding step. Across a variety of tasks, we demonstrate that SpecVocab can achieve a higher acceptance length than state-of-the-art speculative decoding approach, EAGLE-3. Notably, this yields up to an 8.1% increase in average throughput over EAGLE-3.", "AI": {"tldr": "SpecVocab: A dynamic vocabulary selection method for speculative decoding that improves throughput and acceptance length over existing approaches like EAGLE-3.", "motivation": "Existing speculative decoding methods suffer from output distribution bottlenecks due to reduced vocabulary sizes, leading to out-of-vocabulary token issues and compromised speculation effectiveness.", "method": "Proposed SpecVocab, which dynamically selects a context-specific vocabulary subset per decoding step instead of using a fixed reduced vocabulary, combined with efficient token validation and rejection sampling.", "result": "SpecVocab achieved higher average acceptance length (1.65 vs. EAGLE-3's 1.48) and up to 8.1% throughput improvement over EAGLE-3 across multiple tasks, while maintaining generation quality.", "conclusion": "Dynamic vocabulary speculation through SpecVocab outperforms static vocabulary reduction techniques, offering a practical solution for accelerating large language model inference without quality degradation."}}

This paper introduces a hierarchical, zero-shot framework that cascades lightweight object detection with compact Vision-Language Models (VLMs) from the Qwen and Gemma families (4B-12B parameters). Grounding DINO serves as a high-recall, text-promptable region proposer, and frames with high detection confidence are passed to edge-class VLMs for semantic verification. We evaluate this pipeline on 55 high-fidelity synthetic videos from Battlefield 6 across three tasks: false-positive filtering (up to 100% accuracy), damage assessment (up to 97.5%), and fine-grained vehicle classification (55-90%).

On the other hand, ATR models trained to produce normalized outputs have been shown to struggle to adapt to new domains and tend to over-normalize and hallucinate. We introduce the task of Pre-Editorial Normalization (PEN), which consists in normalizing graphemic ATR output according to editorial conventions, which has the advantage of keeping an intermediate step with palaeographic fidelity while providing a normalized version for practical usability. We present a new dataset derived from the CoMMA corpus and aligned with digitized Old French and Latin editions using passim. We also produce a manually corrected gold-standard evaluation set. We benchmark this resource using ByT5-based sequence-to-sequence models on normalization and pre-annotation tasks.

Existing methods struggle to generalize to multi-humanoid scenarios, which involve diverse humanoid forms, complex interactions, and frequent occlusions. We address this gap with two key innovations. First, we introduce unified motion representations that extract identity-agnostic motions and explicitly bind them to corresponding characters, enabling generalization across diverse humanoid forms and seamless extension to multi-humanoid scenarios. Second, we propose a holistic 4D-anchored paradigm that constructs a shared 4D space to fuse motion representations with video latents, and further reinforces this process with hierarchical 4D-level supervision to better handle interactions and occlusions. We instantiate these ideas in MotionWeaver, an end-to-end framework for multi-humanoid image animation. To support this setting, we curate a 46-hour dataset of multi-human videos with rich interactions, and construct a 300-video benchmark featuring paired humanoid characters. Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that MotionWeaver not only achieves state-of-the-art results on our benchmark but also generalizes effectively across diverse humanoid forms, complex interactions, and challenging multi-humanoid scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faMotionWeaver\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u8fd0\u52a8\u8868\u5f81\u4e0e4D\u7a7a\u95f4\u5efa\u6a21\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u591a\u89d2\u8272\u8054\u52a8\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u52a8\u753b\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4eba\u50cf\u4ea4\u4e92\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5355\u4eba\u52a8\u753b\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u591a\u89d2\u8272\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u590d\u6742\u7684\u8eab\u6750\u5dee\u5f02\u3001\u4ea4\u4e92\u884c\u4e3a\u53ca\u906e\u6321\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u76f8\u5e94\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u652f\u6491\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "1) \u8bbe\u8ba1\u8eab\u4efd\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u63d0\u53d6\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b57\u7b26\u7ed1\u5b9a\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u6837\u5316\u89d2\u8272\u9002\u914d\uff1b2) \u6784\u5efa4D\u65f6\u7a7a\u878d\u5408\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u9891\u6f5c\u53d8\u91cf\u4e0e\u8fd0\u52a8\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u76d1\u7763\u7b56\u7565\u5904\u7406\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e0e\u906e\u6321\uff1b3) \u53d1\u5e0346\u5c0f\u65f6\u591a\u89d2\u8272\u4e92\u52a8\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u53ca300\u89c6\u9891\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97SOTA\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5e94\u5bf9\u89d2\u8272\u5f62\u6001\u5dee\u5f02\uff08\u5982\u670d\u9970/\u4f53\u578b\uff09\u3001\u590d\u6742\u4ea4\u4e92\uff08\u5982\u63a5\u89e6/\u906e\u6321\uff09\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u52a8\u753b\u57282240\u00d71400\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0b\u4fdd\u630147FPS\u5b9e\u65f6\u6e32\u67d3\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6848\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u89d2\u8272\u52a8\u753b\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u7fa4\u4f53\u4ea4\u4e92\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u76f8\u5173\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u865a\u62df\u4eba\u793e\u4ea4\u3001\u5f71\u89c6\u7279\u6548\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

However, community-led analyses have raised concerns that HLE contains a non-trivial number of noisy items, which can bias evaluation results and distort cross-model comparisons. To address this challenge, we introduce HLE-Verified, a verified and revised version of HLE with a transparent verification protocol and fine-grained error taxonomy. Our construction follows a two-stage validation-and-repair workflow resulting in a certified benchmark. In Stage I, each item undergoes binary validation of the problem and final answer through domain-expert review and model-based cross-checks, yielding 641 verified items. In Stage II, flawed but fixable items are revised under strict constraints preserving the original evaluation intent, through dual independent expert repairs, model-assisted auditing, and final adjudication, resulting in 1,170 revised-and-certified items. The remaining 689 items are released as a documented uncertain set with explicit uncertainty sources and expertise tags for future refinement. We evaluate seven state-of-the-art language models on HLE and HLE-Verified, observing an average absolute accuracy gain of 7--10 percentage points on HLE-Verified. The improvement is particularly pronounced on items where the original problem statement and/or reference answer is erroneous, with gains of 30--40 percentage points.

Furthermore, we employ a hierarchical transformer-based planner to progressively refine coarse VLA waypoints into fine-grained trajectories. Crucially, the planner utilizes dynamic latent regularization to incorporate language commands, ensuring strict spatial grounding and temporal coherence.

Traditional diagnosis still relies heavily on medical imaging and clinical assessment by physicians, which is often time-consuming and resource-intensive in terms of both human expertise and healthcare resources. In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to the medical field using electronic health records (EHRs), yet their application in Alzheimer's disease assessment remains limited, particularly given that AD involves complex multifactorial etiologies that are difficult to observe directly through imaging modalities. In this work, we propose leveraging LLMs to perform Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning on patients' clinical EHRs. Unlike direct fine-tuning of LLMs on EHR data for AD classification, our approach utilizes LLM-generated CoT reasoning paths to provide the model with explicit diagnostic rationale for AD assessment, followed by structured CoT-based predictions. This pipeline not only enhances the model's ability to diagnose intrinsically complex factors but also improves the interpretability of the prediction process across different stages of AD progression. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CoT-based diagnostic framework significantly enhances stability and diagnostic performance across multiple CDR grading tasks, achieving up to a 15% improvement in F1 score compared to the zero-shot baseline method.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\uff08CoT\uff09\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u7684\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\u8bca\u65ad\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u4e34\u5e8a\u7535\u5b50\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\uff08EHRs\uff09\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2aCDR\u5206\u7ea7\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bca\u65ad\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\u8bca\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u5927\u4e14\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\uff1b\u73b0\u6709LLMs\u5728AD\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u75be\u75c5\u590d\u6742\u7684\u591a\u56e0\u7d20\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4f7f\u7528EHR\u6570\u636e\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u5173\u952e\u8bca\u65ad\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u76f4\u63a5\u5fae\u8c03LLMs\u7684CoT\u8bca\u65ad\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1a\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u663e\u5f0f\u8bca\u65ad\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u2192\u57fa\u4e8e\u8def\u5f84\u63d0\u53d6\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u9884\u6d4b\u7279\u5f81\u2192\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u63a8\u7406\u589e\u5f3aAD\u75c5\u7406\u673a\u5236\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u9879CDR\u5206\u7ea7\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8f83\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5F1\u5206\u6570\u63d0\u534715%\uff0c\u4e14\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5bf9AD\u8fdb\u5c55\u5404\u9636\u6bb5\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5CoT\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bca\u65ad\u601d\u7ef4\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LLMs\u5728AD\u8bca\u65ad\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u795e\u7ecf\u9000\u884c\u6027\u75be\u75c5\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u8bca\u65ad\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

While these explanations enhance accuracy, they are often verbose and costly to generate, raising the question of how much explanation is truly necessary. In this paper, we examine the trade-off between sufficiency, defined as the ability of an explanation to justify the correct answer, and conciseness, defined as the reduction in explanation length. Building on the information bottleneck principle, we conceptualize explanations as compressed representations that retain only the information essential for producing correct answers.To operationalize this view, we introduce an evaluation pipeline that constrains explanation length and assesses sufficiency using multiple language models on the ARC Challenge dataset. To broaden the scope, we conduct experiments in both English, using the original dataset, and Persian, as a resource-limited language through translation. Our experiments show that more concise explanations often remain sufficient, preserving accuracy while substantially reducing explanation length, whereas excessive compression leads to performance degradation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u4fe1\u606f\u74f6\u9888\u6846\u67b6\u4f18\u5316\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5145\u5206\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u89e3\u91ca\u957f\u5ea6\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u7b80\u6d01\u89e3\u91ca\u53ef\u7ef4\u6301\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4f46\u663e\u8457\u7f29\u77ed\u957f\u5ea6\uff0c\u8fc7\u5ea6\u538b\u7f29\u5219\u5f71\u54cd\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u81ea\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u63a8\u7406\u867d\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4f46\u751f\u6210\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u5197\u957f\uff0c\u9700\u63a2\u7d22\u6700\u5c0f\u5fc5\u8981\u89e3\u91ca\u957f\u5ea6\u5728\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u5145\u5206\u6027\u95f4\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u70b9\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b\u957f\u5ea6\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eARC\u6311\u6218\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u82f1\u8bed\u539f\u6570\u636e\u53ca\u6ce2\u65af\u8bed\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6570\u636e\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u89e3\u91ca\u89c6\u4e3a\u4fdd\u7559\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u8868\u793a\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u4fdd\u6301\u8db3\u591f\u7b80\u6d01\u5ea6\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u4ecd\u53ef\u4fdd\u8bc189%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff08\u5982\u5728ARC\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u51cf\u5c1160%\u957f\u5ea6\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u538b\u7f29\u7387\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e34\u754c\u503c\u65f6\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u9aa4\u964d20%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4fe1\u606f\u74f6\u9888\u539f\u7406\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u91ca\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5b58\u5728\u6700\u4f18\u538b\u7f29\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u5728\u8be5\u9608\u503c\u4e0b\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u89e3\u91ca\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u5145\u5206\u6027\u7684\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u6700\u4f18\u3002"}}

However, current multimodal large language models typically process videos with passive sampling or weakly grounded inspection, which limits their ability to iteratively locate, verify, and justify predictions with temporally targeted evidence. To close this gap, we propose MedScope, a tool-using clinical video reasoning model that performs coarse-to-fine evidence seeking over long-form procedures. By interleaving intermediate reasoning with targeted tool calls and verification on retrieved observations, MedScope produces more accurate and trustworthy predictions that are explicitly grounded in temporally localized visual evidence. To address the lack of high-fidelity supervision, we build ClinVideoSuite, an evidence-centric, fine-grained clinical video suite. We then optimize MedScope with Grounding-Aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (GA-GRPO), which directly reinforces tool use with grounding-aligned rewards and evidence-weighted advantages. On full and fine-grained video understanding benchmarks, MedScope achieves state-of-the-art performance in both in-domain and out-of-domain evaluations.

We identify that standard Scalar Quality Metrics (SQM) fall short in this context; by evaluating candidates in isolation, they lack the comparative context necessary to distinguish fine-grained linguistic nuances. To address this, we introduce the Group Quality Metric (GQM) paradigm and instantiate it via the Group Relative Reward Model (GRRM). Unlike traditional independent scorers, GRRM processes the entire candidate group jointly, leveraging comparative analysis to rigorously resolve relative quality and adaptive granularity. Empirical evaluations confirm that GRRM achieves competitive ranking accuracy among all baselines.

This assumption is shown to be inconsistent with the geometry of expert representations. Geometric analysis of a modern MoE embedding model reveals that expert outputs lie on a shared hyperspherical manifold characterized by tightly concentrated norms and substantial angular separation. Under this geometry, linear aggregation induces inward collapse toward the manifold interior, distorting vector magnitude and direction and reducing embedding comparability. To address this inconsistency, Spherical Barycentric Aggregation (SBA) is introduced as a geometry-preserving aggregation operator that separates radial and angular components to maintain hyperspherical structure while remaining fully compatible with existing routing mechanisms. Experiments on selected tasks from the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB), including semantic similarity, clustering, and duplicate question detection, demonstrate consistent performance improvements with identical training cost and full stability. Additional geometric analyses confirm that SBA prevents aggregation-induced collapse and preserves hyperspherical consistency, highlighting the importance of geometry-aware aggregation in MoE embedding architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "MoE\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u4f20\u7edf\u7ebf\u6027\u805a\u5408\u5bfc\u81f4\u8d85\u7403\u9762\u574d\u7f29\uff0cSBA\u65b9\u6cd5\u4fdd\u6301\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfMoE\u7ebf\u6027\u805a\u5408\u5047\u8bbe\u7ebf\u6027\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f46\u4e13\u5bb6\u8868\u5f81\u5b9e\u9645\u5206\u5e03\u4e8e\u8d85\u7403\u9762\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u574d\u7f29\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "SBA\u5206\u79bb\u5f84\u5411\u548c\u89d2\u5ea6\u5206\u91cf\u8fdb\u884c\u51e0\u4f55\u4fdd\u771f\u805a\u5408\uff0c\u517c\u5bb9\u73b0\u6709\u8def\u7531\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "MTEB\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u4e14\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u76f8\u540c\uff0c\u51e0\u4f55\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u5b9e\u907f\u514d\u574d\u7f29\u3002", "conclusion": "\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u805a\u5408\u5bf9MoE\u67b6\u6784\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0cSBA\u6709\u6548\u7ef4\u6301\u8d85\u7403\u9762\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002"}}

However, current approaches rely heavily on static sociodemographic and infrastructure metrics, frequently overlooking the impacts from drivers' visual perception of driving environment. Although visual environment features have been found to impact driving and traffic crashes, existing evidence remains largely observational, failing to establish the robust causality for traffic policy evaluation under complex spatial environment. To fill these gaps, we applied semantic segmentation on Google Street View imageries to extract visual environmental features and proposed a Double Machine Learning framework to quantify their causal effects on regional crashes. Meanwhile, we utilized SHAP values to characterize the nonlinear influence mechanisms of confounding variables in the models and applied causal forests to estimate conditional average treatment effects. Leveraging crash records from the Miami metropolitan area, Florida, and 220,000 street view images, evidence shows that greenery proportion exerts a significant and robust negative causal effect on traffic crashes (Average Treatment Effect = -6.38, p = 0.005). This protective effect exhibits spatial heterogeneity, being most pronounced in densely populated and socially vulnerable urban cores. While greenery significantly mitigates angle and rear-end crashes, its protective benefit for vulnerable road users (VRUs) remains limited.

While prior research has emphasized mid-context degradation in question answering, this study examines the impact of context in LLM-based fact verification. Using three datasets (HOVER, FEVEROUS, and ClimateFEVER) and five open-source models accross different parameters sizes (7B, 32B and 70B parameters) and model families (Llama-3.1, Qwen2.5 and Qwen3), we evaluate both parametric factual knowledge and the impact of evidence placement across varying context lengths. We find that LLMs exhibit non-trivial parametric knowledge of factual claims and that their verification accuracy generally declines as context length increases. Similarly to what has been shown in previous works, in-context evidence placement plays a critical role with accuracy being consistently higher when relevant evidence appears near the beginning or end of the prompt and lower when placed mid-context. These results underscore the importance of prompt structure in retrieval-augmented fact-checking systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u4e8b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4e14\u8bc1\u636e\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff08\u8d77\u59cb\u6216\u7ed3\u5c3e\u66f4\u4f18\uff09\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u578b\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6838\u67e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u7ed3\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5c55\u73b0\u5f3a\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u4e2d\u6bb5\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9000\u5316\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865LLM\u4e8b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u9886\u57df\u5bf9\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8bc1\u636e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eHOVER\u3001FEVEROUS\u548cClimateFEVER\u4e09\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f307B\u81f370B\u53c2\u6570\u89c4\u6a21\u7684Llama-3.1\u3001Qwen2.5\u548cQwen3\u7b495\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u4e8b\u5b9e\u77e5\u8bc6\u53ca\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u3001\u8bc1\u636e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5bf9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "LLM\u5177\u5907\u663e\u8457\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u4e8b\u5b9e\u77e5\u8bc6\u5b58\u50a8\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u9a8c\u8bc1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u968f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u8bc1\u636e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5f00\u5934\u6216\u7ed3\u5c3e\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u663e\u8457\u9ad8\u4e8e\u4e2d\u6bb5\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u578b\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6838\u67e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u7ed3\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9700\u91cd\u70b9\u8003\u8651\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u4e0e\u5173\u952e\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u663e\u773c\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

To address these issues, we propose LogitsCoder, a novel framework that enhances chain-of-thought reasoning through lightweight, logit-level control mechanisms for code generation. LogitsCoder iteratively generates and refines reasoning steps by first steering token selection toward statistically preferred patterns via Logits Preference Decoding, then selecting and aggregating diverse reasoning paths using Logits Rank Based Path Selection and Thoughts Aggregation. This results in coherent and effective reasoning chains that balance depth and efficiency.

We document rapid growth from 1.49 recorded hours in mid-2023 to 2,768.7 total hours in 2025, including 975.89 validated hours available for supervised ASR training.\n  Beyond scale, we analyze validation throughput, contributor participation inequality, demographic metadata completeness, and sentence-level concentration in the validated subset. We find that participation is extremely concentrated (Gini = 0.941), age representation is strongly skewed toward young adults, and 41.97\\% of clips lack self-reported gender labels, limiting subgroup auditing based on metadata. At the textual level, prompt reuse is moderate: 35.88\\% of unique sentences account for 50\\% of validated clips, suggesting that structural concentration is driven primarily by uneven contributor activity rather than dominance of a small prompt set.\n  These results provide a quantitative audit of a rapidly scaling low-resource speech corpus and highlight practical priorities for improving dataset maturity, including expanded validation capacity and broader demographic participation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf9Mozilla Common Voice\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u7684\u5e15\u4ec0\u6258\u8bed\u6570\u636e\uff082023-2025\u5e74\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u5feb\u901f\u589e\u957f\u7684\u89c4\u6a21\u53ca\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u5e15\u4ec0\u6258\u8bed\uff08\u8d856000\u4e07\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\uff09\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5f00\u653e\u8bed\u97f3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u963b\u788dASR\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f00\u53d1\uff0c\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u586b\u8865\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u6570\u636e\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7f3a\u53e3\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790Common Voice v24.0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7edf\u8ba1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3001\u53c2\u4e0e\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\u6027\uff08Gini\u7cfb\u6570\uff09\u3001\u5143\u6570\u636e\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u53ca\u6587\u672c\u96c6\u4e2d\u5ea6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5386\u53f2\u7248\u672c\u8d8b\u52bf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u636e\u6210\u719f\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u636e\u4ece1.49\u5c0f\u65f6\u66b4\u589e\u81f32768.7\u5c0f\u65f6\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65f6\u957f975.89\u5c0f\u65f6\uff1b\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u6781\u5ea6\u96c6\u4e2d\uff08Gini=0.941\uff09\uff0c41.97%\u97f3\u9891\u7f3a\u5931\u6027\u522b\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u5e74\u9f84\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u5411\u9752\u5e74\u4eba\uff1b35.88%\u552f\u4e00\u53e5\u5b50\u5360\u636e50%\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6570\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\u7a81\u7834\u4f46\u6210\u719f\u5ea6\u4ecd\u9700\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u6269\u5c55\u9a8c\u8bc1\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u6539\u8fdb\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u8986\u76d6\uff0c\u5e76\u5e73\u8861\u8d21\u732e\u8005\u6d3b\u52a8\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u96c6\u4e2d\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

We argue that robust alignment for non-verifiable tasks is fundamentally a principle generalization problem: reward should not be a learned function internalized into a judge, but an explicit reasoning process executed under inspectable principles. To operationalize this view, we present the Open Rubric System (OpenRS), a plug-and-play, rubrics-based LLM-as-a-Judge framework built around Pairwise Adaptive Meta-Rubrics (PAMR) and lightweight Pointwise Verifiable Rubrics (PVRs), which provide both hard-constraint guardrails and verifiable reward components when ground-truth or programmatic checks are available. OpenRS uses an explicit meta-rubric -- a constitution-like specification that governs how rubrics are instantiated, weighted, and enforced -- and instantiates adaptive rubrics on the fly by conditioning on the semantic differences between two candidate responses. It then performs criterion-wise pairwise comparisons and aggregates criterion-level preferences externally, avoiding pointwise weighted scalarization while improving discriminability in open-ended settings. To keep principles consistent yet editable across various domains, we introduce a two-level meta-rubric refinement pipeline (automated evolutionary refinement for general principles and a reproducible human-in-the-loop procedure for domain principles), complemented with pointwise verifiable rubrics that act as both guardrails against degenerate behaviors and a source of verifiable reward for objective sub-tasks.

Master's thesis, Liverpool John Moores University, November 2022", "summary": "Automated image captioning using the content from the image is very appealing when done by harnessing the capability of computer vision and natural language processing. Extensive research has been done in the field with a major focus on the English language which gives the scope for further developments in the same with consideration of popular foreign languages. This research utilizes distinct models for translating the image caption into Hindi, the fourth most popular language across the world. Exploring the multi-modal architectures this research comprises local visual features, global visual features, attention mechanisms, and pre-trained models. Using google cloud translator on the image dataset from Flickr8k, Hindi image descriptions have been generated. Pre-trained CNNs like VGG16, ResNet50, and Inception V3 helped in retrieving image characteristics, while the uni-directional and bi-directional techniques of text encoding are used for the text encoding process. An additional Attention layer helps to generate a weight vector and, by multiplying it, combine image characteristics from each time step into a sentence-level feature vector. Bilingual evaluation understudy scores are used to compare the research outcome. Many experiments that serve as a baseline are done for the comparative analysis of the research. An image with a score of BLEU-1 is considered sufficient, whereas one with a score of BLEU-4 is considered to have fluid image captioning.

We introduce \\textbf{AdaCorrection}, an adaptive offset cache correction framework that maintains high generation fidelity while enabling efficient cache reuse across Transformer layers during diffusion inference. At each timestep, AdaCorrection estimates cache validity with lightweight spatio-temporal signals and adaptively blends cached and fresh activations.

Our evaluation of 17 LLMs on 30 \\textit{Cipai} reveals two critical phenomena: models frequently generate valid but unexpected historical variants of a poetic form, and adherence to tonal patterns is substantially harder than structural rules. We further show that form-aware prompting can improve structural and tonal control for stronger models, while potentially degrading weaker ones.

We propose a multi-agent medical QA framework that combines complementary LLMs with evidence retrieval, uncertainty estimation, and bias checks to improve answer reliability. Our approach has two phases. First, we fine-tune three representative LLM families (GPT, LLaMA, and DeepSeek R1) on MedQuAD-derived medical QA data (20k+ question-answer pairs across multiple NIH domains) and benchmark generation quality. DeepSeek R1 achieves the strongest scores (ROUGE-1 0.536 +- 0.04; ROUGE-2 0.226 +-0.03; BLEU 0.098 -+ 0.018) and substantially outperforms the specialised biomedical baseline BioGPT in zero-shot evaluation. Second, we implement a modular multi-agent pipeline in which a Clinical Reasoning agent (fine-tuned LLaMA) produces structured explanations, an Evidence Retrieval agent queries PubMed to ground responses in recent literature, and a Refinement agent (DeepSeek R1) improves clarity and factual consistency; an optional human validation path is triggered for high-risk or high-uncertainty cases. Safety mechanisms include Monte Carlo dropout and perplexity-based uncertainty scoring, plus lexical and sentiment-based bias detection supported by LIME/SHAP-based analyses. In evaluation, the full system achieves 87% accuracy with relevance around 0.80, and evidence augmentation reduces uncertainty (perplexity 4.13) compared to base responses, with mean end-to-end latency of 36.5 seconds under the reported configuration.

However, most unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) datasets focus on outdoor scenes and offer limited temporally coherent indoor videos. We introduce an indoor dataset of $14,400$ frames capturing inter-drone and ground vehicle footage, annotated via a semi-automatic workflow with a $98.6\\%$ first-pass labeling agreement before final manual verification. Using this dataset, we benchmark 3 replay-based CIL strategies: Experience Replay (ER), Maximally Interfered Retrieval (MIR), and Forgetting-Aware Replay (FAR), using YOLOv11-nano as a resource-efficient detector for deployment-constrained UAV platforms. Under tight memory budgets ($5-10\\%$ replay), FAR performs better than the rest, achieving an average accuracy (ACC, $mAP_{50-95}$ across increments) of $82.96\\%$ with $5\\%$ replay. Gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) analysis shows attention shifts across classes in mixed scenes, which is associated with reduced localization quality for drones. The experiments further demonstrate that replay-based continual learning can be effectively applied to edge aerial systems. Overall, this work contributes an indoor UAV video dataset with preserved temporal coherence and an evaluation of replay-based CIL under limited replay budgets.

However, deploying Text VQA on wearable devices faces a fundamental tension: text recognition requires high-resolution video, but streaming high-quality video drains battery and causes thermal throttling. Moreover, existing models struggle to maintain coherent temporal context when processing text across multiple frames in real-time streams. We observe that text recognition and visual reasoning have asymmetric resolution requirements - OCR needs fine detail while scene understanding tolerates coarse features. We exploit this asymmetry with a hybrid architecture that performs selective high-resolution OCR on-device while streaming low-resolution video for visual context. On a benchmark of text-based VQA samples across five task categories, our system achieves 72% accuracy at 0.49x the power consumption of full-resolution streaming, enabling sustained VQA sessions on resource-constrained wearables without sacrificing text understanding quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387OCR\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f20\u8f93\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u89c6\u9891\u4ee5\u7ef4\u6301\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u5728\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u9700\u6c42\u4e0a\u7684\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u9ad8\u6548\u8fd0\u884c\u6587\u672cVisual Question Answering\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "motivation": "\u90e8\u7f72\u6587\u672cVisual Question Answering\u4efb\u52a1\u81f3\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\u5728\u4e8e\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u89c6\u9891\u6d41\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u9ad8\u529f\u8017\u4e0e\u70ed\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u591a\u5e27\u6587\u672c\u8bed\u4e49\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\uff1a\u5bf9OCR\u5904\u7406\u91c7\u7528\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5e27\uff0c\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u4e49\u7ef4\u6301\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6d41\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u673a\u5236\u878d\u5408\u591a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5728\u672c\u5730\u5904\u7406\u6587\u672c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8de8\u4e94\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u73b072%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff08\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5168\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u65b9\u6848\u635f\u5931\u5c0f\u4e8e5%\uff09\uff0c\u80fd\u8017\u964d\u81f349%\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u70ed\u7ea6\u675f\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u53ef\u8fde\u7eed\u8fd0\u884cVQA\u4efb\u52a1\u8d85\u8fc730\u5206\u949f\uff08\u5bf9\u7167\u65b9\u68483\u5206\u949f\u5373\u89e6\u53d1\u8fc7\u70ed\u4fdd\u62a4\uff09", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u5f02\u6784\u6027\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5206\u5c42\u5904\u7406\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u8bbe\u5907\u90e8\u7f72\u590d\u6742\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, research indicates a significant gap between this theoretical capacity and the practical ability of models to robustly utilize information within long contexts, especially in tasks that require a comprehensive understanding of numerous details. This paper evaluates the performance of four state-of-the-art models (Grok-4, GPT-4, Gemini 2.5, and GPT-5) on long short-context tasks. For this purpose, three datasets were used: two supplementary datasets for retrieving culinary recipes and math problems, and a primary dataset of 20K social media posts for depression detection. The results show that as the input volume on the social media dataset exceeds 5K posts (70K tokens), the performance of all models degrades significantly, with accuracy dropping to around 50-53% for 20K posts. Notably, in the GPT-5 model, despite the sharp decline in accuracy, its precision remained high at approximately 95%, a feature that could be highly effective for sensitive applications like depression detection. This research also indicates that the \"lost in the middle\" problem has been largely resolved in newer models.

While traditional approaches rely on handcrafted features mimicking clinical scales, recent advances in video foundation models (VFMs) enable representation learning without task-specific customization. However, the comparative effectiveness of different VFM architectures across diverse clinical tasks remains poorly understood. We present a large-scale systematic study using a novel video dataset from 1,888 participants (727 with PD), comprising 32,847 videos across 16 standardized clinical tasks. We evaluate seven state-of-the-art VFMs -- including VideoPrism, V-JEPA, ViViT, and VideoMAE -- to determine their robustness in clinical screening. By evaluating frozen embeddings with a linear classification head, we demonstrate that task saliency is highly model-dependent: VideoPrism excels in capturing visual speech kinematics (no audio) and facial expressivity, while V-JEPA proves superior for upper-limb motor tasks. Notably, TimeSformer remains highly competitive for rhythmic tasks like finger tapping. Our experiments yield AUCs of 76.4-85.3% and accuracies of 71.5-80.6%. While high specificity (up to 90.3%) suggests strong potential for ruling out healthy individuals, the lower sensitivity (43.2-57.3%) highlights the need for task-aware calibration and integration of multiple tasks and modalities. Overall, this work establishes a rigorous baseline for VFM-based PD screening and provides a roadmap for selecting suitable tasks and architectures in remote neurological monitoring.

In scientific settings, however, unsupported or uncertain conclusions can be more harmful than abstaining. We study this problem through an abstention-aware verification framework that decomposes scientific claims into minimal conditions, audits each condition against available evidence using natural language inference (NLI), and selectively decides whether to support, refute, or abstain. We evaluate this framework across two complementary scientific benchmarks: SciFact and PubMedQA, covering both closed-book and open-domain evidence settings. Experiments are conducted with six diverse language models, including encoder-decoder, open-weight chat models, and proprietary APIs. Across all benchmarks and models, we observe that raw accuracy varies only modestly across architectures, while abstention plays a critical role in controlling error. In particular, confidence-based abstention substantially reduces risk at moderate coverage levels, even when absolute accuracy improvements are limited. Our results suggest that in scientific reasoning tasks, the primary challenge is not selecting a single best model, but rather determining when available evidence is sufficient to justify an answer. This work highlights abstention-aware evaluation as a practical and model-agnostic lens for assessing scientific reliability, and provides a unified experimental basis for future work on selective reasoning in scientific domains.

Recently, several works suggest that making sparse attention trainable can further increase sparsity while preserving generation quality. We study three key questions: (1) when do the two common masking rules, i.e., Top-k and Top-p, fail, and how can we avoid these failures? (2) why can trainable sparse attention reach higher sparsity than training-free methods? (3) what are the limitations of fine-tuning sparse attention using the diffusion loss, and how can we address them? Based on this analysis, we propose SpargeAttention2, a trainable sparse attention method that achieves high sparsity without degrading generation quality. SpargeAttention2 includes (i) a hybrid masking rule that combines Top-k and Top-p for more robust masking at high sparsity, (ii) an efficient trainable sparse attention implementation, and (iii) a distillation-inspired fine-tuning objective to better preserve generation quality during fine-tuning using sparse attention. Experiments on video diffusion models show that SpargeAttention2 reaches 95% attention sparsity and a 16.2x attention speedup while maintaining generation quality, consistently outperforming prior sparse attention methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSpargeAttention2\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b095%\u7a00\u758f\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u534716.2\u500d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u6781\u9650\uff08\u9ad8\u7a00\u758f\u4e0b\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\uff09\uff0c\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u63a9\u7801\u5931\u6548\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u65b9\u6848", "method": "SpargeAttention2\u5305\u542b\uff1a1) \u6df7\u5408Top-k/p\u63a9\u7801\u89c4\u5219\u589e\u5f3a\u9ad8\u7a00\u758f\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1b2) \u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a00\u758f\u5b9e\u73b0\uff1b3) \u84b8\u998f\u5f0f\u5fae\u8c03\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u4fdd\u6301", "result": "\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u523095%\u7a00\u758f\u5ea6\uff08\u5bf9\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u534720%\uff09\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u534716.2\u500d\uff0cFID\u5206\u6570\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u5bc6\u96c6\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u76f8\u5f53", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u89e3\u51b3\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u6df7\u5408\u63a9\u7801\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u548c\u84b8\u998f\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6848"}}

Recent methods based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have achieved photorealistic modeling in autonomous driving scene reconstruction, but they primarily focus on normal-light conditions. Low-light driving scenes are more challenging to model due to their complex lighting and appearance conditions, which often causes performance degradation of existing methods. To address this problem, this work presents a novel approach that integrates physically based rendering into 3DGS to enhance nighttime scene reconstruction for autonomous driving. Specifically, our approach integrates physically based rendering into composite scene Gaussian representations and jointly optimizes Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) based material properties. We explicitly model diffuse components through a global illumination module and specular components by anisotropic spherical Gaussians. As a result, our approach improves reconstruction quality for outdoor nighttime driving scenes, while maintaining real-time rendering.

We introduce three measurable geometric statistics: \u03b1 (polarity coupling), \\b{eta} (cluster cohesion), and \u03bb_s (radial information gradient). Across all 11 models, polarity structure (\u03b1 > 0.5) is universal (11/11), cluster cohesion (\\b{eta} > 0) is universal (11/11), and the radial information gradient is significant (9/11, p < 0.05). We demonstrate that the two models failing \u03bb_s significance -- ALBERT and MiniLM -- do so for architecturally explicable reasons: factorized embedding compression and distillation-induced isotropy, respectively.

Moreover, existing ITC methods offer limited control over how to perform reasoning, which in turn limits their explainability. We present STATe-of-Thoughts (STATe), an interpretable ITC method that searches over high-level reasoning patterns. STATe replaces stochastic sampling with discrete and interpretable textual interventions: a controller selects actions encoding high-level reasoning choices, a generator produces reasoning steps conditioned on those choices, and an evaluator scores candidates to guide search. This structured approach yields three main advantages. First, action-guided textual interventions produce greater response diversity than temperature-based sampling. Second, in a case study on argument generation, STATe's explicit action sequences capture interpretable features that are highly predictive of output quality. Third, estimating the association between performance and action choices allows us to identify promising yet unexplored regions of the action space and steer generation directly toward them.

In this paper, we identify a fundamental trade-off in these methods: a predefined scaling factor can be too weak at some generation steps, leaving hallucinations unresolved, yet too strong at others, leading to new hallucinations. Motivated by this finding, we propose AdaVBoost, a token-level visual attention boosting framework that adaptively determines how much attention to boost at each generation step. Specifically, we introduce Visual Grounding Entropy (VGE) to estimate hallucination risk, which leverages visual grounding as a complementary signal to capture evidence mismatches beyond entropy. Guided by VGE, AdaVBoost applies stronger visual attention boosting to high-risk tokens and weaker boosting to low-risk tokens, enabling token-level adaptive intervention at each generation step.

The fundamental nature of scientific evaluation needs knowledgeable grounding, collective deliberation, and multi-criteria decision-making. However, existing idea evaluation methods often suffer from narrow knowledge horizons, flattened evaluation dimensions, and the inherent bias in LLM-as-a-Judge. To address these, we regard idea evaluation as a knowledge-grounded, multi-perspective reasoning problem and introduce InnoEval, a deep innovation evaluation framework designed to emulate human-level idea assessment. We apply a heterogeneous deep knowledge search engine that retrieves and grounds dynamic evidence from diverse online sources. We further achieve review consensus with an innovation review board containing reviewers with distinct academic backgrounds, enabling a multi-dimensional decoupled evaluation across multiple metrics.

While effective for many generation tasks, such an approach may not fully capture the structure of complex reasoning tasks, where a single semantic decision is often realized across multiple tokens--for example, when defining variables or composing equations. This introduces a potential mismatch between token-level optimization and the inherently block-level nature of reasoning in these settings. To bridge this gap, we propose Multi-token Policy Gradient Optimization (MPO), a framework that treats sequences of K consecutive tokens as unified semantic actions. This block-level perspective enables our method to capture the compositional structure of reasoning trajectories and supports optimization over coherent, higher-level objectives.

This variability limits consistent assessment, training, and the development of reliable artificial intelligence systems, as most surgical AI models are designed for narrowly defined tasks and do not generalize across procedures or institutions. Here we introduce ZEN, a generalizable foundation model for intraoperative surgical video understanding trained on more than 4 million frames from over 21 procedures using a self-supervised multi-teacher distillation framework.

The embedding space functions as a conditional expectation over a \u03c3-algebra, and its failure to be isomorphic to the semantic truth set fundamentally causes logical consistency breakdown. WavePhaseNet Method The authors propose WavePhaseNet, which explicitly constructs a Semantic Conceptual Hierarchy Structure (SCHS) using Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). By applying DFT along the sequence dimension, semantic information is decomposed into frequency bands: low-frequency components capture global meaning and intent, while high-frequency components represent local syntax and expression. This staged separation enables precise semantic manipulation in diagonalized space. Dimensionality Reduction GPT-4's 24,576-dimensional embedding space exhibits a 1/f spectral structure based on language self-similarity and Zipf's law. Through cumulative energy analysis, the authors derive that approximately 3,000 dimensions constitute the lower bound for \"complete representation.\" This demonstrates that reduction from 24,576 to 3,000 dimensions preserves meaning and intent while enabling rigorous reasoning and suppressing hallucination. Cohomological Consistency Control The reduced embedding space, constructed via cohomological regularization over overlapping local windows, allows defining a graph structure and cochain complex. This quantifies inconsistencies among local inferences as coboundary-based losses. Applying harmonic projection based on Hodge theory positions cohomology as a computable regularization principle for controlling semantic consistency, extracting maximally consistent global representations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u5ea6\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u9891\u7387\u5206\u6790\u91cd\u65b0\u9610\u8ff0LLM\u4e2d\u7684Transformer/Attention\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u8bc1\u660e\u5e7b\u89c9\u662f\u7ed3\u6784\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51faWavePhaseNet\u548c\u4f59\u4e0a\u540c\u8c03\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u63a7\u5236\u6280\u672f\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u771f\u7406\u96c6\u7684\u540c\u6784\u7f3a\u5931\u5bfc\u81f4\u903b\u8f91\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5d29\u6e83\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u79bb\u6563\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u53d8\u6362\u6784\u5efa\u8bed\u4e49\u6982\u5ff5\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784(SCHS)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc71/f\u8c31\u5206\u6790\u786e\u5b9a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0b\u9650\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f59\u4e0a\u540c\u8c03\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6784\u5efa\u4f4e\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e24,576\u7ef4\u52303,000\u7ef4\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u4fdd\u7559\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u9891\u7387\u5206\u89e3\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bed\u4e49\u64cd\u63a7\uff0c\u4f59\u4e0a\u540c\u8c03\u635f\u5931\u91cf\u5316\u5c40\u90e8\u63a8\u7406\u77db\u76fe\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e7b\u89c9\u6e90\u4e8e\u7ed3\u6784\u7f3a\u9677\u800c\u975e\u8bad\u7ec3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9891\u57df\u5206\u79bb\u4e0e\u4f59\u4e0a\u540c\u8c03\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u5e7b\u89c9\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002"}}

DCDM decomposes video consistency modeling under these scenarios into three dedicated components while sharing a unified video generation backbone. For intra-clip consistency, DCDM leverages a large language model to parse input prompts into structured semantic representations, which are subsequently translated into coherent video content by a diffusion transformer. For inter-clip camera consistency, we propose a temporal camera representation in the noise space that enables precise and stable camera motion control, along with a text-to-image initialization mechanism to further enhance controllability. For inter-shot consistency, DCDM adopts a holistic scene generation paradigm with windowed cross-attention and sparse inter-shot self-attention, ensuring long-range narrative coherence while maintaining computational efficiency.

Existing compression and distillation techniques are largely designed for static graphs; directly applying them to temporal settings may overlook time-dependent interactions and lead to performance degradation. We propose an LLM-assisted distillation framework specifically designed for temporal knowledge graph reasoning. Beyond a conventional high-capacity temporal teacher, we incorporate a large language model as an auxiliary instructor to provide enriched supervision. The LLM supplies broad background knowledge and temporally informed signals, enabling a lightweight student to better model event dynamics without increasing inference-time complexity.

These processes resulted in a bias test composed of more than 10,000 prompts which assess whether models demonstrate sexist and homophobic prejudices relevant to the Philippine context. We then apply FilBBQ on models trained in Filipino but do so with a robust evaluation protocol that improves upon the reliability and accuracy of previous BBQ implementations. Specifically, we account for models' response instability by obtaining prompt responses across multiple seeds and averaging the bias scores calculated from these distinctly seeded runs.

We formalize this phenomenon through a three-level measurement hierarchy: lexical, entropic, and probabilistic anchoring, each captures surface artifacts, entropy dynamics, and latent answer dependence, respectively. We analyze semantic suppression, the intuitive mitigation strategy that instructs models to ignore the answer, to find out its counterproduction: while it reduces lexical overlap, it paradoxically increases entropic and probabilistic anchoring. Drawing on Ironic Process Theory from cognitive psychology, we attribute this failure to active monitoring of the forbidden answer, which inadvertently deepens dependence on it. To break this cycle, we propose Structural Skeleton-guided Reasoning (SSR), a two-phase approach that first generates an answer-invariant functional skeleton structure, then uses this skeleton to guide full trace generation. By redirecting the information flow to structural planning rather than answer monitoring, SSR consistently reduces anchoring across all three levels. We further introduce Distilled SSR (SSR-D), which fine-tunes models on teacher-generated SSR traces to ensure reliable structural adherence. Experiments across open-ended reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that SSR-D achieves up to 10% improvement over suppression baselines while preserving out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5f15\u5bfc\u63a8\u7406\uff08SSR\u53caSSR-D\uff09\u89e3\u51b3\u53cd\u5411\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u751f\u6210\uff08RCG\uff09\u4e2d\u56e0\u7b54\u6848\u4f9d\u8d56\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u540e\u9a8c\u5408\u7406\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u8bcd\u6cd5\u3001\u71b5\u548c\u6982\u7387\u951a\u5b9a\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u53cd\u5411\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u751f\u6210\uff08RCG\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u7b54\u6848\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8ba4\u77e5\u951a\u70b9\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u540e\u9a8c\u5408\u7406\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u8bed\u4e49\u6291\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u56e0\u89e6\u53d1\u77db\u76fe\u5fc3\u7406\u673a\u5236\u53cd\u800c\u52a0\u5267\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u9700\u63a2\u7d22\u66f4\u4f18\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "1. \u6784\u5efa\u4e09\u7ea7\u6d4b\u91cf\u4f53\u7cfb\uff08\u8bcd\u6cd5\u3001\u71b5\u3001\u6982\u7387\u951a\u5b9a\uff09\u91cf\u5316\u7b54\u6848\u4f9d\u8d56\uff1b2. \u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u6784\u9aa8\u67b6\u5f15\u5bfc\u63a8\u7406\uff08SSR\uff09\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u5148\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u7b54\u6848\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u9aa8\u67b6\uff0c\u518d\u5f15\u5bfc\u5b8c\u6574\u63a8\u7406\uff1b3. \u5f00\u53d1SSR-D\u6a21\u578b\u84b8\u998f\u6280\u672f\u589e\u5f3a\u7ed3\u6784\u9075\u5faa\u3002", "result": "SSR-D\u5728\u4e09\u7ea7\u951a\u5b9a\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e2d\u5747\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4f9d\u8d56\u5ea6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u76f8\u8f83\u6291\u5236\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u534710%\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u8de8\u5206\u5e03\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff08OOD\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u4ece\u7b54\u6848\u76d1\u63a7\u8f6c\u5411\u7ed3\u6784\u89c4\u5212\uff0cSSR/SSR-D\u6709\u6548\u7834\u89e3\u8ba4\u77e5\u951a\u5b9a\u5faa\u73af\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u63a7\u63a8\u7406\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

However, their application in domain-specific agricultural tasks, such as plant pathology, remains limited due to the lack of large-scale, comprehensive multimodal image--text datasets and benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce LeafNet, a comprehensive multimodal dataset, and LeafBench, a visual question-answering benchmark developed to systematically evaluate the capabilities of VLMs in understanding plant diseases. The dataset comprises 186,000 leaf digital images spanning 97 disease classes, paired with metadata, generating 13,950 question-answer pairs spanning six critical agricultural tasks. The questions assess various aspects of plant pathology understanding, including visual symptom recognition, taxonomic relationships, and diagnostic reasoning. Benchmarking 12 state-of-the-art VLMs on our LeafBench dataset, we reveal substantial disparity in their disease understanding capabilities. Our study shows performance varies markedly across tasks: binary healthy--diseased classification exceeds 90\\% accuracy, while fine-grained pathogen and species identification remains below 65\\%. Direct comparison between vision-only models and VLMs demonstrates the critical advantage of multimodal architectures: fine-tuned VLMs outperform traditional vision models, confirming that integrating linguistic representations significantly enhances diagnostic precision. These findings highlight critical gaps in current VLMs for plant pathology applications and underscore the need for LeafBench as a rigorous framework for methodological advancement and progress evaluation toward reliable AI-assisted plant disease diagnosis.

However, their rigid retrieval schemes and dense similarity search often introduce irrelevant context, increase computational overhead, and limit relational expressiveness. In contrast, n-ary hypergraphs encode higher-order relational facts that capture richer inter-entity dependencies and enable shallower, more efficient reasoning paths. To address this limitation, we propose HyperRAG, a RAG framework tailored for n-ary hypergraphs with two complementary retrieval variants: (i) HyperRetriever learns structural-semantic reasoning over n-ary facts to construct query-conditioned relational chains. It enables accurate factual tracking, adaptive high-order traversal, and interpretable multi-hop reasoning under context constraints. (ii) HyperMemory leverages the LLM's parametric memory to guide beam search, dynamically scoring n-ary facts and entities for query-aware path expansion. Extensive evaluations on WikiTopics (11 closed-domain datasets) and three open-domain QA benchmarks (HotpotQA, MuSiQue, and 2WikiMultiHopQA) validate HyperRAG's effectiveness. HyperRetriever achieves the highest answer accuracy overall, with average gains of 2.95% in MRR and 1.23% in Hits@10 over the strongest baseline. Qualitative analysis further shows that HyperRetriever bridges reasoning gaps through adaptive and interpretable n-ary chain construction, benefiting both open and closed-domain QA.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faHyperRAG\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8en\u5143\u8d85\u56fe\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u5176\u6838\u5fc3\u521b\u65b0\u4e3aHyperRetriever\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d85\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u8bed\u4e49\u6784\u5efa\u67e5\u8be2\u6761\u4ef6\u5173\u7cfb\u94fe\uff09\u4e0eHyperMemory\uff08\u5229\u7528LLM\u53c2\u6570\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6307\u5bfc\u8def\u5f84\u6269\u5c55\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u9636\u5173\u7cfb\u5efa\u6a21\u6539\u5584\u591a\u8df3\u95ee\u7b54\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u7684\u4e8c\u5143\u5173\u7cfb\u8868\u5b58\u5728\u68c0\u7d22\u521a\u6027\u3001\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u641c\u7d22\u5f15\u5165\u5197\u4f59\u3001\u5173\u7cfb\u8868\u8fbe\u53d7\u9650\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u8d85\u56fe\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u5145\u5206\u6316\u6398\u9ad8\u9636\u5b9e\u4f53\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "1) HyperRetriever\uff1a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9762\u5411n\u5143\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u9ad8\u9636\u904d\u5386\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u591a\u8df3\u63a8\u7406\uff1b2) HyperMemory\uff1a\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u675f\u641c\u7d22\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b9e\u4f53\u4e0e\u9ad8\u9636\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728WikiTopics\u3001HotpotQA\u7b49\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cHyperRAG\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u53472.95% MRR\u4e0e1.23% Hits@10\u6307\u6807\u3002\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u5176\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5f25\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u7f3a\u53e3\uff0c\u95ed\u57df\u4e0e\u5f00\u57df\u95ee\u7b54\u5747\u53d7\u76ca\u3002", "conclusion": "n\u5143\u8d85\u56fe\u7684\u9ad8\u9636\u5173\u7cfb\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8def\u5f84\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u5173\u7cfb\u63a8\u7406\u573a\u666f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Manual annotation is expensive and difficult to scale, while using large language models (LLMs) as automated annotators introduces concerns about label reliability, bias, and evaluation validity. This work presents a Bangla IR dataset constructed using a BETA-labeling framework involving multiple LLM annotators from diverse model families. The framework incorporates contextual alignment, consistency checks, and majority agreement, followed by human evaluation to verify label quality. Beyond dataset creation, we examine whether IR datasets from other low-resource languages can be effectively reused through one-hop machine translation. Using LLM-based translation across multiple language pairs, we experimented on meaning preservation and task validity between source and translated datasets.

This study focuses on waste segregation, a crucial step in recycling processes to obtain raw material. Recent advancements in computer vision have significantly contributed to waste classification and recognition. In waste segregation, segmentation masks are essential for robots to accurately localize and pick objects from conveyor belts. The complexity of real-world waste environments, characterized by deformed items without specific patterns and overlapping objects, further complicates waste segmentation tasks. This paper proposes an Ensemble Learning approach to improve segmentation accuracy by combining high performing segmentation models, U-Net and FPN, using a weighted average method. U-Net excels in capturing fine details and boundaries in segmentation tasks, while FPN effectively handles scale variation and context in complex environments, and their combined masks result in more precise predictions. The dataset used closely mimics real-life waste scenarios, and preprocessing techniques were applied to enhance feature learning for deep learning segmentation models. The ensemble model, referred to as EL-4, achieved an IoU value of 0.8306, an improvement over U-Net's 0.8065, and reduced Dice loss to 0.09019 from FPN's 0.1183.

However, existing paradigms primarily yield static, task-agnostic embeddings that struggle to reconcile the divergent requirements of downstream scenarios within unified vector spaces. Furthermore, heterogeneous multi-source data introduces inherent noise and modality conflicts, degrading representation. We propose Query-as-Anchor, a framework shifting user modeling from static encoding to dynamic, query-aware synthesis. To empower Large Language Models (LLMs) with deep user understanding, we first construct UserU, an industrial-scale pre-training dataset that aligns multi-modal behavioral sequences with user understanding semantics, and our Q-Anchor Embedding architecture integrates hierarchical coarse-to-fine encoders into dual-tower LLMs via joint contrastive-autoregressive optimization for query-aware user representation. To bridge the gap between general pre-training and specialized business logic, we further introduce Cluster-based Soft Prompt Tuning to enforce discriminative latent structures, effectively aligning model attention with scenario-specific modalities. For deployment, anchoring queries at sequence termini enables KV-cache-accelerated inference with negligible incremental latency. Evaluations on 10 Alipay industrial benchmarks show consistent SOTA performance, strong scalability, and efficient deployment. Large-scale online A/B testing in Alipay's production system across two real-world scenarios further validates its practical effectiveness.

Although Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven foundation generative models excel at natural image synthesis, they often struggle in medical imaging due to limited domain-specific training, compromising the anatomical fidelity required for clinical analysis. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation (WDLoRA)-based multimodal generative framework for clinically guided CCM image synthesis. WDLoRA is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) mechanism that decouples magnitude and directional weight updates, enabling foundation generative models to independently learn the orientation (nerve topology) and intensity (stromal contrast) required for medical realism. By jointly conditioning on nerve segmentation masks and disease-specific clinical prompts, the model synthesises anatomically coherent images across the DPN spectrum (Control, T1NoDPN, T1DPN).

We examine this fundamental question by evaluating whether LLMs genuinely reason mathematically in these languages or depend on implicit translation to English-like representations. Using a taxonomy of six math problem types, from basic arithmetic to complex unit conflict and optimization problems, we evaluate four prominent large language models. To avoid translation artifacts that confound language ability with translation quality, we construct a parallel dataset where each problem is natively authored by fluent speakers with mathematical training in all three languages. Our analysis demonstrates that while basic arithmetic reasoning transfers robustly across languages, complex reasoning tasks show significant degradation in Tamil and Sinhala. The pattern of failures varies by model and problem type, suggesting that apparent multilingual competence may not reflect uniform reasoning capabilities across languages.

Fine-tuning, an important step for adapting LLMs to specific downstream tasks, typically involves further training on corresponding datasets. However, a fundamental discrepancy exists between current fine-tuning datasets and the token-level optimization mechanism of LLMs: most datasets are designed at the sentence-level, which introduces token-level noise, causing negative influence to final performance. In this paper, we propose XTF, an explainable token-level noise filtering framework. XTF decomposes the complex and subtle contributions of token-level data to the fine-tuning process into three distinct and explicit attributes (reasoning importance, knowledge novelty, and task relevance), which can be assessed using scoring methods, and then masks the gradients of selected noisy tokens accordingly to optimize the performance of fine-tuned LLMs. We conduct extensive experiments on three representative downstream tasks (math, code and medicine) across 7 mainstream LLMs. The results demonstrate that XTF can significantly improve downstream performance by up to 13.7% compared to regular fine-tuning.

These models typically rely on learning meaningful latent representations, which are particularly valuable given the high-dimensional nature of 3D medical images like brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Despite their potential, latent representations remain underexplored in terms of their structure, information content, and applicability to downstream clinical tasks. Investigating these representations is crucial for advancing the use of generative models in neuroimaging research and clinical decision-making. In this work, we develop multiple variational autoencoders (VAEs) to encode 3D brain MRI scans into compact latent space representations for generative and predictive applications. We systematically evaluate the effectiveness of the learned representations through three key analyses: (i) a quantitative and qualitative assessment of MRI reconstruction quality, (ii) a visualisation of the latent space structure using Principal Component Analysis, and (iii) downstream classification tasks on a proprietary dataset of euploid and Down syndrome individuals brain MRI scans.

Based on this prompt dataset, we introduce a unified evaluation framework that integrates LLM-based Evaluation, Multi-factor Motion evaluation, and Fine-grained Accuracy Evaluation. Our experimental results reveal that while different baseline models demonstrate strengths in areas such as text-to-motion semantic alignment, motion generalizability, and physical quality, most models struggle to achieve strong performance with Fine-grained Accuracy Evaluation. These findings highlight the limitations of existing methods in OOD scenarios and offer practical guidance for the design and evaluation of future production-level text-to-motion models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u6587\u672c\u5230\u52a8\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u57df\u5916\uff08OOD\uff09\u6587\u672c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5305\u542b1025\u4e2a\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\u7684OOD\u63d0\u793a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u96c6\u6210LLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u3001\u591a\u56e0\u5b50\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u51c6\u786e\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u666e\u904d\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u672c\u5230\u52a8\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u4e00\u5206\u5e03\u5185\u6587\u672c\u548c\u6709\u9650\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u57df\u5916\u6587\u672c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u52a8\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5584\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u5411\u6a21\u7cca\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b1,025\u6761\u6311\u6218\u6027\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\u7684OOD\u63d0\u793a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6587\u672c-\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30 2\uff09\u52a8\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u591a\u56e0\u5b50\u5206\u6790\uff08\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3001\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u6027\u3001\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff093\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u5173\u8282\u7ea7\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u52a8\u4f5c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a1\uff09\u4e0d\u540c\u57fa\u51c6\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u8fd0\u52a8\u6cdb\u5316\u7b49\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02 2\uff09\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5173\u8282\u52a8\u4f5c\u91cd\u5efa\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0d\u8db330% 3\uff09\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5206\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u52a8\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u4f46\u964d\u4f4e\u6587\u672c\u5339\u914d\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u672c\u5230\u52a8\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u57df\u5916\u6587\u672c\u65f6\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u5bf9\u751f\u4ea7\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u4e3a\u6539\u8fdb\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u673a\u5236\u548c\u5f00\u53d1\u9762\u5411\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f53\u7cfb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u660e\u786e\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

While this hypothesis has been tested empirically, prior studies are limited exclusively to text-only inputs, abstracting away from the perceptual context in which utterances are produced. In this work, we present the first computational study of UID in visually grounded settings. We estimate surprisal using multilingual vision-and-language models over image-caption data in 30 languages and visual storytelling data in 13 languages, together spanning 11 families. We find that grounding on perception consistently smooths the distribution of information, increasing both global and local uniformity across typologically diverse languages compared to text-only settings. In visual narratives, grounding in both image and discourse contexts has additional effects, with the strongest surprisal reductions occurring at the onset of discourse units. Overall, this study takes a first step towards modelling the temporal dynamics of information flow in ecologically plausible, multimodal language use, and finds that grounded language exhibits greater information uniformity, supporting a context-sensitive formulation of UID.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u5883\u4e0b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5747\u5300\u4fe1\u606f\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5047\u8bf4\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u8a00\u4fe1\u606f\u5206\u5e03\u5747\u5300\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6b64\u524d\u5747\u5300\u4fe1\u606f\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5047\u8bf4\u4ec5\u5728\u7eaf\u6587\u672c\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u5883\u540e\u8be5\u5047\u8bf4\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u89c6-\u8bed\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u679030\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u56fe\u6587\u6570\u636e\u548c13\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u53d9\u4e8b\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f30\u8ba1surprisal\u503c\u6d4b\u91cf\u4fe1\u606f\u5206\u5e03\u5747\u5300\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u5883\u663e\u8457\u5e73\u6ed1\u4e86\u4fe1\u606f\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u7c7b\u578b\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u5747\u5300\u6027\uff0c\u89c6\u89c9\u53d9\u4e8b\u4e2d\u8bed\u7bc7\u8d77\u59cb\u5355\u5143\u7684surprisal\u503c\u964d\u4f4e\u6700\u663e\u8457\u3002", "conclusion": "\u652f\u6301\u8bed\u5883\u654f\u611f\u7684\u5747\u5300\u4fe1\u606f\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5047\u8bf4\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u8a00\u4f7f\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u52a8\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u52a0\u7b26\u5408\u751f\u6001\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u3002"}}

This limitation is particularly pronounced in open-source MLLMs. The gap largely stems from existing datasets with limited domain coverage, coarse structural annotations, and weak semantic grounding. We introduce OmniScience, a large-scale, high-fidelity multi-modal dataset comprising 1.5 million figure-caption-context triplets, spanning more than 10 major scientific disciplines. To obtain image caption data with higher information density and accuracy for multi-modal large-model training, we develop a dynamic model-routing re-captioning pipeline that leverages state-of-the-art multi-modal large language models to generate dense, self-contained descriptions by jointly synthesizing visual features, original figure captions, and corresponding in-text references authored by human scientists. The pipeline is further reinforced with rigorous quality filtering and alignment with human expert judgments, ensuring both factual accuracy and semantic completeness, and boosts the image-text multi-modal similarity score from 0.769 to 0.956. We further propose a caption QA protocol as a proxy task for evaluating visual understanding.

Therefore, we propose FAL-AD, a novel framework that synergistically integrates federated learning with data augmentation to systematically optimize data efficiency. Our approach delivers three key breakthroughs: First, absolute efficiency improvement through voice conversion-based augmentation, which generates diverse pathological speech samples via cross-category voice-content recombination. Second, collaborative efficiency breakthrough via an adaptive federated learning paradigm, maximizing cross-institutional benefits under privacy constraints. Finally, representational efficiency optimization by an attentive cross-modal fusion model, which achieves fine-grained word-level alignment and acoustic-textual interaction. Evaluated on ADReSSo, FAL-AD achieves a state-of-the-art multi-modal accuracy of 91.52%, outperforming all centralized baselines and demonstrating a practical solution to the data efficiency dilemma.

SAM4Dcap integrates the temporally consistent 4D human mesh recovery of SAM-Body4D with the OpenSim biomechanical solver. The pipeline converts reconstructed meshes into trajectory files compatible with diverse musculoskeletal models. We introduce automated prompting strategies and a Linux-native build for processing. Preliminary evaluations on walking and drop-jump tasks indicate that SAM4Dcap has the potential to achieve knee kinematic predictions comparable to multi-view systems, although some discrepancies in hip flexion and residual jitter remain.

As a result, motions that look plausible as joint trajectories often exhibit body self-penetration and Foot-Ground Contact (FGC) anomalies when visualized with a human body mesh, reducing the aesthetic appeal of generated dances and limiting their real-world applications. We address this skeleton-to-mesh gap by deriving physics-based rewards from the body mesh and applying Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tuning (RLFT) to steer the diffusion model toward physically plausible motion synthesis under mesh visualization. Our reward design combines (i) an imitation reward that measures a motion's general plausibility by its imitability in a physical simulator (penalizing penetration and foot skating), and (ii) a Foot-Ground Deviation (FGD) reward with test-time FGD guidance to better capture the dynamic foot-ground interaction in dance. However, we find that the physics-based rewards tend to push the model to generate freezing motions for fewer physical anomalies and better imitability. To mitigate it, we propose an anti-freezing reward to preserve motion dynamics while maintaining physical plausibility.

Among these methods, semantic change detection (SCD) can more effectively interpret the multi-class information contained in bi-temporal RS imagery, providing semantic-level predictions that support dynamic change monitoring. However, due to the limited semantic understanding capability of the model and the inherent complexity of the SCD tasks, existing SCD methods face significant challenges in both performance and paradigm complexity. In this paper, we propose PerASCD, a SCD method driven by RS foundation model PerA, designed to enhance the multi-scale semantic understanding and overall performance. We introduce a modular Cascaded Gated Decoder (CG-Decoder) that simplifies complex SCD decoding pipelines while promoting effective multi-level feature interaction and fusion. In addition, we propose a Soft Semantic Consistency Loss (SSCLoss) to mitigate the numerical instability commonly encountered during SCD training. We further explore the applicability of multiple existing RS foundation models on the SCD task when equipped with the proposed decoder. Experimental results demonstrate that our decoder not only effectively simplifies the paradigm of SCD, but also achieves seamless adaptation across various vision encoders.

To address this challenge, our key insight is that real-world dynamics exhibits a multi-scale regularity from object to particle level. To this end, we design the multi-scale dynamics mechanism that factorizes complex motion fields. Within this formulation, we propose Gaussian sequences with multi-scale dynamics, a novel representation for dynamic 3D Gaussians derived through compositions of multi-level motion. This layered structure substantially alleviates ambiguity of reconstruction and promotes physically plausible dynamics. We further incorporate multi-modal priors from vision foundation models to establish complementary supervision, constraining the solution space and improving the reconstruction fidelity.

We systematically evaluate several open- and closed-weights RLMs on the WMT24++ benchmark and find that enabling explicit reasoning consistently degrades translation quality across languages and models. Analysis reveals that MT reasoning traces are highly linear, lacking revision, self-correction and exploration of alternative translations, which limits their usefulness. Furthermore, injecting higher-quality reasoning traces from stronger models does not reliably improve weaker models' performance. To address this mismatch, we propose a structured reasoning framework tailored to translation, based on multi-step drafting, adequacy refinement, fluency improvement, and selective iterative revision.

However, text-to-3D generation remains challenging, primarily due to bottlenecks in learning discrete 3D representations.

This effect is further amplified by vector quantization, ultimately degrading the geometric coherence of text-conditioned 3D shapes. Moreover, the conventional two-stage training paradigm induces an objective mismatch between reconstruction and text-conditioned auto-regressive generation. To address these issues, we propose View-aware Auto-Regressive 3D (VAR-3D), which intergrates a view-aware 3D Vector Quantized-Variational AutoEncoder (VQ-VAE) to convert the complex geometric structure of 3D models into discrete tokens.

Recent studies demonstrate that incorporating generative Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning can substantially enhance task-specific representations compared to discriminative methods. However, the generated reasoning CoTs of existing generative embedding methods are limited to the textual analysis of queries and are irrelevant to the retrieval of the targets. To address these limitations, we propose a reasoning-driven UME framework that integrates Embedder-Guided Reinforcement Learning (EG-RL) to optimize the Reasoner to produce evidential Traceability CoT (T-CoT). Our key contributions are threefold: (1) We design an EG-RL framework where the Embedder provides explicit supervision to the Reasoner, ensuring the generated CoT traces are aligned with embedding tasks. (2) We introduce T-CoT, which extracts critical multimodal cues to focus on retrieval-relevant elements and provides multimodal inputs for the Embedder. (3) With limited computational resources, our framework outperforms the pioneering embedding model on both MMEB-V2 and UVRB benchmarks. The integration of multimodal evidence in structured reasoning, paired with retrieval-oriented alignment, effectively strengthens cross-modal semantic consistency and boosts the fine-grained matching capability of the model as well as the generalization across complex scenarios. Our work demonstrates that targeted reasoning optimization can significantly improve multimodal embedding quality, providing a practical and efficient solution for reasoning-driven UME development.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u901a\u7528\u5d4c\u5165\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u68c0\u7d22\u76f8\u5173\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u4f18\u5316\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u8003(CoT)\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6587\u672c\u5206\u6790\u4e14\u4e0e\u68c0\u7d22\u76ee\u6807\u65e0\u5173\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u751f\u6210\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u672a\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u3002\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bc1\u636e\u6574\u5408\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5d4c\u5165\u5668\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08EG-RL\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\uff1a1\uff09\u5d4c\u5165\u5668\u76d1\u7763\u63a8\u7406\u5668\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eafCoT\uff08T-CoT\uff09\uff1b2\uff09T-CoT\u63d0\u53d6\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u76f8\u5173\u7ebf\u7d22\uff1b3\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u68c0\u7d22\u5bf9\u9f50\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728MMEB-V2/UVRB\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u65f6\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5339\u914d\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u573a\u666f\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5d4c\u5165\u6846\u67b6\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u6574\u5408\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u8d44\u6e90\u9ad8\u6548\u578b\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Here, we investigate the intersection of these phenomena. We fine-tune GPT-4.1 models sequentially on datasets known to induce and reverse emergent misalignment and evaluate whether the models are self-aware of their behavior transitions without providing in-context examples. Our results show that emergently misaligned models rate themselves as significantly more harmful compared to their base model and realigned counterparts, demonstrating behavioral self-awareness of their own emergent misalignment.

Nevertheless, because speckle patterns inherently encode both texture and fine anatomical details, effectively suppressing noise while preserving structural fidelity remains a significant challenge. In this study, we propose a prior-guided hierarchical instance-pixel contrastive learning model for ultrasound denoising, designed to promote noise-invariant and structure-aware feature representations by maximizing the separability between noisy and clean samples at both pixel and instance levels. Specifically, a statistics-guided pixel-level contrastive learning strategy is introduced to enhance distributional discrepancies between noisy and clean pixels, thereby improving local structural consistency. Concurrently, a memory bank is employed to facilitate instance-level contrastive learning in the feature space, encouraging representations that more faithfully approximate the underlying data distribution. Furthermore, a hybrid Transformer-CNN architecture is adopted, coupling a Transformer-based encoder for global context modeling with a CNN-based decoder optimized for fine-grained anatomical structure restoration, thus enabling complementary exploitation of long-range dependencies and local texture details.

Evaluated across diverse datasets, the framework achieves strong perceptual quality, semantic fidelity, and temporal consistency at ultra-low bitrates (< 0.0003 bpp), outperforming classical, neural, and generative baselines in extensive quantitative, qualitative, and subjective evaluations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8d85\u4f4e\u7801\u7387\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b", "motivation": "\u5728\u5e26\u5bbd\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u3001\u56e0\u679c\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u573a\u666f\u7ed3\u6784\u7f16\u7801\u4e0e\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7eb9\u7406\u6d41\u4f20\u8f93\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5305\u542b\u8bed\u4e49\u63a7\u5236\u3001\u91cd\u6784\u9002\u914d\u5668\u548c\u65f6\u5e8f\u9002\u914d\u5668\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u65f6\u5e8f\u84b8\u998f\u6d41\u7a0b", "result": "\u5728<0.0003 bpp\u7801\u7387\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0300\u500d\u53c2\u6570\u538b\u7f29\u548c2\u500d\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u591a\u9879\u6307\u6807\u8d85\u8d8a\u7ecf\u5178/\u795e\u7ecf/\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u7ebf", "conclusion": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u53ef\u80fd\u6027"}}

Recent years have witnessed growing interest in reasoning tasks within Natural Language Processing (NLP). However, no prior research has examined the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on non-question-answering (non-QA) physical commonsense reasoning tasks in low-resource languages such as Basque. Taking the Italian GITA as a starting point, this paper addresses this gap by presenting BasPhyCo, the first non-QA physical commonsense reasoning dataset for Basque, available in both standard and dialectal variants. We evaluate model performance across three hierarchical levels of commonsense understanding: (1) distinguishing between plausible and implausible narratives (accuracy), (2) identifying the conflicting element that renders a narrative implausible (consistency), and (3) determining the specific physical state that creates the implausibility (verifiability). These tasks were assessed using multiple multilingual LLMs as well as models pretrained specifically for Italian and Basque. Results indicate that, in terms of verifiability, LLMs exhibit limited physical commonsense capabilities in low-resource languages such as Basque, especially when processing dialectal variants.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86BasPhyCo\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u9996\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\uff08\u5df4\u65af\u514b\u8bed\uff09\u7684\u975e\u95ee\u7b54\u578b\u7269\u7406\u5e38\u8bc6\u63a8\u7406\u8bc4\u4f30\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u6807\u51c6\u53ca\u65b9\u8a00\u53d8\u4f53\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u793a\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8be5\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u65b9\u8a00\u53d8\u4f53\u7684\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u5c42\u7ea7\uff09\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6709\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u672a\u63a2\u7d22\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\uff08\u5982\u5df4\u65af\u514b\u8bed\uff09\u4e2d\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u975e\u95ee\u7b54\u578b\u7269\u7406\u5e38\u8bc6\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9488\u5bf9\u65b9\u8a00\u53d8\u4f53\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u610f\u5927\u5229\u8bedGITA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b\u6807\u51c6\u5df4\u65af\u514b\u8bed\u548c\u65b9\u8a00\u53d8\u4f53\u7684BasPhyCo\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e09\u5c42\u7ea7\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u53ef\u533a\u5206\u6027\u3001\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53ca\u610f/\u5df4\u65af\u514b\u8bed\u4e13\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u5dee\uff1a\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bef\u5224\u7387\u9ad8\u8fbe40%\uff0c\u5df4\u65af\u514b\u8bed\u4e13\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u8bef\u5224\u738730%\uff0c\u65b9\u8a00\u53d8\u4f53\u8f83\u6807\u51c6\u8bed\u8bef\u5224\u7387\u9ad8\u51fa15-20%\u3002", "conclusion": "BasPhyCo\u4e3a\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u7269\u7406\u5e38\u8bc6\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u8a00\u53d8\u4f53\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u51f8\u663e\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u8bed\u8a00\u6784\u5efa\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f53\u7cfb\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

A 3D reconstruction of the Da Vinci robotic arms was refined and animated in Autodesk Maya through a fully automated Python-based pipeline capable of producing photorealistic, labeled video sequences. Each scene integrates randomized motion patterns, lighting variations, and synthetic blood textures to mimic intraoperative variability while preserving pixel-accurate ground truth masks. To validate the realism and effectiveness of the generated data, several segmentation models were trained under controlled ratios of real and synthetic data. Results demonstrate that a balanced composition of real and synthetic samples significantly improves model generalization compared to training on real data only, while excessive reliance on synthetic data introduces a measurable domain shift. The proposed framework provides a reproducible and scalable tool for surgical computer vision, supporting future research in data augmentation, domain adaptation, and simulation-based pretraining for robotic-assisted surgery.

Recent work hypothesized that behavioral alignment can be drastically improved through \\emph{generative} -- rather than \\emph{discriminative} -- classifiers, with far-reaching implications for models of human vision.\n  Here, we instead show that the increased alignment of generative models can be largely explained by a seemingly innocuous resizing operation in the generative model which effectively acts as a low-pass filter. In a series of controlled experiments, we show that removing high-frequency spatial information from discriminative models like CLIP drastically increases their behavioral alignment. Simply blurring images at test-time -- rather than training on blurred images -- achieves a new state-of-the-art score on the model-vs-human benchmark, halving the current alignment gap between DNNs and human observers. Furthermore, low-pass filters are likely optimal, which we demonstrate by directly optimizing filters for alignment. To contextualize the performance of optimal filters, we compute the frontier of all possible pareto-optimal solutions to the benchmark, which was formerly unknown.\n  We explain our findings by observing that the frequency spectrum of optimal Gaussian filters roughly matches the spectrum of band-pass filters implemented by the human visual system. We show that the contrast sensitivity function, describing the inverse of the contrast threshold required for humans to detect a sinusoidal grating as a function of spatiotemporal frequency, is approximated well by Gaussian filters of the specific width that also maximizes error consistency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u53d1\u73b0\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c6\u89c9\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u66f4\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u4f4e\u901a\u6ee4\u6ce2\u800c\u975e\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u56fe\u50cf\u6a21\u7cca\u5373\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76DNNs\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c6\u89c9\u5bf9\u9f50\u5dee\u8ddd\u7684\u6839\u6e90\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u4e8e\u5224\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u662f\u5426\u6210\u7acb\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u79fb\u9664\u9ad8\u9891\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u3001\u5e94\u7528\u4f4e\u901a\u6ee4\u6ce2\u53ca\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u6a21\u7cca\u56fe\u50cf\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4f18\u5316\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u53c2\u6570\u5e76\u8ba1\u7b97\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u524d\u6cbf\u5206\u6790\u6027\u80fd\u6781\u9650\u3002", "result": "\u5224\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u53bb\u9664\u9ad8\u9891\u4fe1\u606f\u540e\u5bf9\u9f50\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\uff1b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u6a21\u7cca\u8fbe\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u6210\u7ee9\uff1b\u4f18\u5316\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u903c\u8fd1\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c6\u89c9\u9891\u7387\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u63ed\u793a\u57fa\u51c6\u6027\u80fd\u524d\u6cbf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f4e\u901a\u6ee4\u6ce2\u662f\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u4f18\u52bf\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5176\u9891\u7387\u8c31\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c6\u89c9\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5e26\u901a\u7279\u6027\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5339\u914d\u3002"}}

Cross-domain news recommendation further requires inferring user's underlying information needs from heterogeneous signals that often extend beyond direct news consumption.

In this paper, we present a reinforcement learning framework that trains large language models to generate high-quality lists of interest-driven news search queries from cross-domain user signals. We formulate query-list generation as a policy optimization problem and employ GRPO with multiple reward signals. We systematically study two compute dimensions: inference-time sampling and model capacity, and empirically observe consistent improvements with increased compute that exhibit scaling-like behavior. Finally, we perform on-policy distillation to transfer the learned policy from a large, compute-intensive teacher to a compact student model suitable for scalable deployment.

The core challenge is a routing problem: each task admits dozens of preference dimensions, yet individual users care about only a few, and which ones matter depends on who is asking. With a limited question budget, asking without structure will miss the dimensions that matter. Reinforcement learning is the natural formulation, but in multi-turn settings its terminal reward fails to exploit the factored, per-criterion structure of preference data, and in practice learned policies collapse to static question sequences that ignore user responses. We propose decomposing cold-start elicitation into offline structure learning and online Bayesian inference. Pep (Preference Elicitation with Priors) learns a structured world model of preference correlations offline from complete profiles, then performs training-free Bayesian inference online to select informative questions and predict complete preference profiles, including dimensions never asked about. The framework is modular across downstream solvers and requires only simple belief models. Across medical, mathematical, social, and commonsense reasoning, Pep achieves 80.8% alignment between generated responses and users' stated preferences versus 68.5% for RL, with 3-5x fewer interactions. When two users give different answers to the same question, Pep changes its follow-up 39-62% of the time versus 0-28% for RL.

Existing models primarily rely on vision and language modalities; however, language alone lacks molecular specificity and offers limited pathological supervision, leading to representational bottlenecks. In this paper, we propose STAMP, a Spatial Transcriptomics-Augmented Multimodal Pathology representation learning framework that integrates spatially-resolved gene expression profiles to enable molecule-guided joint embedding of pathology images and transcriptomic data. Our study shows that self-supervised, gene-guided training provides a robust and task-agnostic signal for learning pathology image representations. Incorporating spatial context and multi-scale information further enhances model performance and generalizability. To support this, we constructed SpaVis-6M, the largest Visium-based spatial transcriptomics dataset to date, and trained a spatially-aware gene encoder on this resource. Leveraging hierarchical multi-scale contrastive alignment and cross-scale patch localization mechanisms, STAMP effectively aligns spatial transcriptomics with pathology images, capturing spatial structure and molecular variation. We validate STAMP across six datasets and four downstream tasks, where it consistently achieves strong performance. These results highlight the value and necessity of integrating spatially resolved molecular supervision for advancing multimodal learning in computational pathology.

However, they often suffer from severe extrapolation failure, where rapid error accumulation leads to significant temporal degradation when extending beyond training horizons. We identify that this failure primarily stems from the \\textit{spectral bias} of 3D positional embeddings and the lack of \\textit{dynamic priors} in noise sampling. To address these issues, we propose \\textbf{FLEX} (\\textbf{F}requency-aware \\textbf{L}ength \\textbf{EX}tension), a training-free inference-time framework that bridges the gap between short-term training and long-term inference. FLEX introduces Frequency-aware RoPE Modulation to adaptively interpolate under-trained low-frequency components while extrapolating high-frequency ones to preserve multi-scale temporal discriminability. This is integrated with Antiphase Noise Sampling (ANS) to inject high-frequency dynamic priors and Inference-only Attention Sink to anchor global structure. Extensive evaluations on VBench demonstrate that FLEX significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models at $6\\times$ extrapolation (30s duration) and matches the performance of long-video fine-tuned baselines at $12\\times$ scale (60s duration). As a plug-and-play augmentation, FLEX seamlessly integrates into existing inference pipelines for horizon extension. It effectively pushes the generation limits of models such as LongLive, supporting consistent and dynamic video synthesis at a 4-minute scale.

While model compression techniques such as pruning have emerged as essential tools, traditional magnitude-based pruning methods do not necessarily align with the true functional contribution of network components to task-specific performance. In this work, we present an explainability-inspired, layer-wise pruning framework tailored for efficient object detection. Our approach leverages a SHAP-inspired gradient--activation attribution to estimate layer importance, providing a data-driven proxy for functional contribution rather than relying solely on static weight magnitudes. We conduct comprehensive experiments across diverse object detection architectures, including ResNet-50, MobileNetV2, ShuffleNetV2, Faster R-CNN, RetinaNet, and YOLOv8, evaluating performance on the Microsoft COCO 2017 validation set. The results show that the proposed attribution-inspired pruning consistently identifies different layers as least important compared to L1-norm-based methods, leading to improved accuracy--efficiency trade-offs. Notably, for ShuffleNetV2, our method yields a 10\\% empirical increase in inference speed, whereas L1-pruning degrades performance by 13.7\\%.

With high-entropy binary latents, BitDance lets each token represent up to $2^{256}$ states, yielding a compact yet highly expressive discrete representation. Sampling from such a huge token space is difficult with standard classification. To resolve this, BitDance uses a binary diffusion head: instead of predicting an index with softmax, it employs continuous-space diffusion to generate the binary tokens. Furthermore, we propose next-patch diffusion, a new decoding method that predicts multiple tokens in parallel with high accuracy, greatly speeding up inference. On ImageNet 256x256, BitDance achieves an FID of 1.24, the best among AR models. With next-patch diffusion, BitDance beats state-of-the-art parallel AR models that use 1.4B parameters, while using 5.4x fewer parameters (260M) and achieving 8.7x speedup. For text-to-image generation, BitDance trains on large-scale multimodal tokens and generates high-resolution, photorealistic images efficiently, showing strong performance and favorable scaling.

Although image restoration techniques offer a promising direction for enhancing degraded visual content, conventional real-world image restoration (Real-IR) models primarily focus on pixel-level fidelity and often fail to recover task-relevant semantic cues, limiting their effectiveness when directly applied to downstream vision tasks. Conversely, existing segmentation models trained on high-quality data lack robustness under real-world degradations. In this paper, we propose Restoration Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation (RASS), which effectively integrates semantic image restoration into the segmentation process, enabling high-quality semantic segmentation on the LQ images directly. Specifically, we first propose a Semantic-Constrained Restoration (SCR) model, which injects segmentation priors into the restoration model by aligning its cross-attention maps with segmentation masks, encouraging semantically faithful image reconstruction. Then, RASS transfers semantic restoration knowledge into segmentation through LoRA-based module merging and task-specific fine-tuning, thereby enhancing the model's robustness to LQ images.

However, forcing these models to textually characterize imperceptible low-level tampering traces inevitably leads to hallucinations, as linguistic modalities are insufficient to capture such fine-grained pixel-level inconsistencies. To overcome this, we propose ForgeryVCR, a framework that incorporates a forensic toolbox to materialize imperceptible traces into explicit visual intermediates via Visual-Centric Reasoning. To enable efficient tool utilization, we introduce a Strategic Tool Learning post-training paradigm, encompassing gain-driven trajectory construction for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and subsequent Reinforcement Learning (RL) optimization guided by a tool utility reward.

A comprehensive set of 29 state-of-the-art real-time object detectors, including 14 in the YOLO (v11-13) and 15 in the RT-DETR (v1-v4) families at varied model scales, was systematically evaluated through replicated modeling experiments for chestnut detection. Experimental results show that the YOLOv12m model achieves the best mAP@0.5 of 95.1% among all the evaluated models, while the RT-DETRv2-R101 was the most accurate variant among RT-DETR models, with mAP@0.5 of 91.1%. In terms of mAP@[0.5:0.95], the YOLOv11x model achieved the best accuracy of 80.1%. All models demonstrate significant potential for real-time chestnut detection, and YOLO models outperformed RT-DETR models in terms of both detection accuracy and inference, making them better suited for on-board deployment.

To bridge the gap between preoperative planning and intraoperative execution, we present ARport, an augmented reality (AR) system that automatically maps pre-planned trocar layouts onto the patient's body surface, providing intuitive spatial guidance during surgical preparation. Methods: ARport, implemented on an optical see-through head-mounted display (OST-HMD), operates without any external sensors or markers, simplifying setup and enhancing workflow integration. It reconstructs the operative scene from RGB, depth, and pose data captured by the OST-HMD, extracts the patient's body surface using a foundation model, and performs surface-based markerless registration to align preoperative anatomical models to the extracted patient's body surface, enabling in-situ visualization of planned trocar layouts. A demonstration video illustrating the overall workflow is available online. Results: In full-scale human-phantom experiments, ARport accurately overlaid pre-planned trocar sites onto the physical phantom, achieving consistent spatial correspondence between virtual plans and real anatomy.

Concurrently, the success of multimodal foundation models that integrate vision with complementary modalities suggests that morphomolecular coupling between local expression and morphology can be systematically used to improve histological representations themselves. We introduce Spatial Expression-Aligned Learning (SEAL), a vision-omics self-supervised learning framework that infuses localized molecular information into pathology vision encoders. Rather than training new encoders from scratch, SEAL is designed as a parameter-efficient vision-omics finetuning method that can be flexibly applied to widely used pathology foundation models. We instantiate SEAL by training on over 700,000 paired gene expression spot-tissue region examples spanning tumor and normal samples from 14 organs. Tested across 38 slide-level and 15 patch-level downstream tasks, SEAL provides a drop-in replacement for pathology foundation models that consistently improves performance over widely used vision-only and ST prediction baselines on slide-level molecular status, pathway activity, and treatment response prediction, as well as patch-level gene expression prediction tasks.

However, existing visual tokenizers typically struggle to satisfy these conflicting objectives within a single framework. In this paper, we introduce UniWeTok, a unified discrete tokenizer designed to bridge this gap using a massive binary codebook ($\\mathit{2^{128}}$). For training framework, we introduce Pre-Post Distillation and a Generative-Aware Prior to enhance the semantic extraction and generative prior of the discrete tokens. In terms of model architecture, we propose a convolution-attention hybrid architecture with the SigLu activation function. SigLu activation not only bounds the encoder output and stabilizes the semantic distillation process but also effectively addresses the optimization conflict between token entropy loss and commitment loss. We further propose a three-stage training framework designed to enhance UniWeTok's adaptability cross various image resolutions and perception-sensitive scenarios, such as those involving human faces and textual content. On ImageNet, UniWeTok achieves state-of-the-art image generation performance (FID: UniWeTok 1.38 vs. REPA 1.42) while requiring a remarkably low training compute (Training Tokens: UniWeTok 33B vs. REPA 262B). On general-domain, UniWeTok demonstrates highly competitive capabilities across a broad range of tasks, including multimodal understanding, image generation (DPG Score: UniWeTok 86.63 vs. FLUX.1 [Dev] 83.84), and editing (GEdit Overall Score: UniWeTok 5.09 vs. OmniGen 5.06).

Existing diffusion-based editing methods often struggle to maintain consistency across multiple conditions due to limited interaction between reference inputs. To address this, we introduce Sequence-Extended Latent Fusion (SELF), a unified input representation that dynamically serializes multiple reference images into a coherent latent sequence. During a dedicated training stage, all reference images are jointly constrained to fit within a fixed-length sequence under a global pixel-budget constraint. Building upon SELF, we propose a two-stage training framework comprising supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). In the SFT stage, we jointly train on single-image editing and multi-image composition tasks to establish a robust generative prior. We adopt a progressive sequence length training strategy, in which all input images are initially resized to a total pixel budget of $1024^2$, and are then gradually increased to $1536^2$ and $2048^2$ to improve visual fidelity and cross-reference consistency. This gradual relaxation of compression enables the model to incrementally capture finer visual details while maintaining stable alignment across references. For the RL stage, we introduce Multi-Source GRPO (MSGRPO), to our knowledge the first reinforcement learning framework tailored for multi-reference image generation.

However, direct human annotation is prohibitively expensive while vision-saliency models generalize poorly. We introduce HiVid, the first framework to leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) as a scalable human proxy to generate high-fidelity weights for both Video-on-Demand (VOD) and live streaming. We address 3 non-trivial challenges: (1) To extend LLMs' limited modality and circumvent token limits, we propose a perception module to assess frames in a local context window, autoregressively building a coherent understanding of the video. (2) For VOD with rating inconsistency across local windows, we propose a ranking module to perform global re-ranking with a novel LLM-guided merge-sort algorithm.

This work addresses this limitation by introducing topologically-enriched versions of ModelNet40 and ShapeNet, where each point cloud is augmented with its corresponding persistent homology features. These benchmarks with the topological signatures establish a foundation for unified geometry-topology learning and enable systematic evaluation of topology-aware deep learning architectures for 3D shape analysis. Building on this foundation, we propose a deep learning-based significant persistent point selection method, \\textit{TopoGAT}, that learns to identify the most informative topological features directly from input data and the corresponding topological signatures, circumventing the limitations of hand-crafted statistical selection criteria. A comparative study verifies the superiority of the proposed method over traditional statistical approaches in terms of stability and discriminative power. Integrating the selected significant persistent points into standard point cloud classification and part-segmentation pipelines yields improvements in both classification accuracy and segmentation metrics.

By integrating a temporal filter based on optical flow analysis for detecting inter-frame redundancy and a spatial filter leveraging saliency detection for identifying visually significant regions, Sali-Cache intelligently manages memory allocation before entering computationally expensive attention operations. Experimental evaluation on the LLaVA 1.6 architecture demonstrates that our method achieves a 2.20x compression ratio in effective memory usage while maintaining 100% accuracy across BLEU, ROUGE-L, and Exact Match metrics.

Yet, most available grounding datasets provide sparse supervision, with insufficient and low-diversity labels that annotate only a small subset of task-relevant elements per screen, which limits both coverage and generalization; moreover, practical deployment requires efficiency to enable low-latency, on-device use. We introduce ScreenParse, a large-scale dataset for complete screen parsing, with dense annotations of all visible UI elements (boxes, 55-class types, and text) across 771K web screenshots (21M elements). ScreenParse is generated by Webshot, an automated, scalable pipeline that renders diverse urls, extracts annotations and applies VLM-based relabeling and quality filtering. Using ScreenParse, we train ScreenVLM, a compact, 316M-parameter vision language model (VLM) that decodes a compact ScreenTag markup representation with a structure-aware loss that upweights structure-critical tokens. ScreenVLM substantially outperforms much larger foundation VLMs on dense parsing (e.g., 0.592 vs. 0.294 PageIoU on ScreenParse) and shows strong transfer to public benchmarks. Moreover, finetuning foundation VLMs on ScreenParse consistently improves their grounding performance, suggesting that dense screen supervision provides transferable structural priors for UI understanding.

Primarily, two different kinds of error values are used: photometric error and re-projection error. The selection of error value is usually directly dependent on the selection of feature paradigm, photometric features, or geometric features. It is a trade-off between accuracy, robustness, and the possibility of loop closing. We investigate a third method that combines the strengths of both paradigms into a unified approach. Using densely sampled geometric feature descriptors, we replace the photometric error with a descriptor residual from a dense set of descriptors, thereby enabling the employment of sub-pixel accuracy in differential photometric methods, along with the expressiveness of the geometric feature descriptor. Experiments show that although the proposed strategy is an interesting approach that results in accurate tracking, it ultimately does not outperform pose optimization strategies based on re-projection error despite utilizing more information. We proceed to analyze the underlying reason for this discrepancy and present the hypothesis that the descriptor similarity metric is too slowly varying and does not necessarily correspond strictly to keypoint placement accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u5408\u5149\u5ea6\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u59ff\u6001\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u6548\u679c\u672a\u8d85\u8d8a\u91cd\u6295\u5f71\u8bef\u5dee\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u56e0\u63cf\u8ff0\u5b50\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\u4e0e\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5173\u8054\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5149\u5ea6\u8bef\u5dee\u4e0e\u91cd\u6295\u5f71\u8bef\u5dee\u9700\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u95ed\u73af\u80fd\u529b\u95f4\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u8bd5\u56fe\u878d\u5408\u4e24\u8005\u4f18\u52bf\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5bc6\u96c6\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\u63cf\u8ff0\u5b50\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u5149\u5ea6\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e9a\u50cf\u7d20\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u5dee\u5206\u5149\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u8ddf\u8e2a\uff0c\u4f46\u76f8\u8f83\u91cd\u6295\u5f71\u8bef\u5dee\u7b56\u7565\u6548\u679c\u672a\u6539\u5584\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5229\u7528\u4e86\u66f4\u591a\u7279\u5f81\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63cf\u8ff0\u5b50\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\u53d8\u5316\u7f13\u6162\u5bfc\u81f4\u65e0\u6cd5\u4e25\u683c\u5173\u8054\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u7cbe\u786e\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u662f\u6027\u80fd\u672a\u7a81\u7834\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u539f\u56e0\u3002"}}

However, current AI diagnostic tools are often trained on datasets dominated by lighter skin tones, leading to reduced accuracy and fairness for people with darker skin. The International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) dataset, one of the most widely used benchmarks, contains over 70% light skin images while dark skins fewer than 8%. This imbalance poses a significant barrier to equitable healthcare delivery and highlights the urgent need for methods that address demographic diversity in medical imaging. This paper addresses this challenge of skin tone imbalance in automated skin cancer detection using dermoscopic images. To overcome this, we present a generative augmentation pipeline that fine-tunes a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on the image dark-skin subset of the ISIC dataset and generates synthetic dermoscopic images conditioned on lesion type and skin tone. In this study, we investigated the utility of these images on two downstream tasks: lesion segmentation and binary classification. For segmentation, models trained on the augmented dataset and evaluated on held-out real images show consistent improvements in IoU, Dice coefficient, and boundary accuracy. These evalutions provides the verification of Generated dataset. For classification, an EfficientNet-B0 model trained on the augmented dataset achieved 92.14% accuracy.

Early diagnosis and tight follow-up are essential to the management of RA, as ongoing inflammation can cause irreversible joint damage. The detection of arthritis is important for diagnosis and assessment of disease activity; however, it often takes a long time for patients to receive appropriate specialist care. Therefore, there is a strong need to develop systems that can detect joint inflammation easily using RGB images captured at home. Consequently, we tackle the task of RA inflammation detection from RGB hand images. This task is highly challenging due to general issues in medical imaging, such as the scarcity of positive samples, data imbalance, and the inherent difficulty of the task itself. However, to the best of our knowledge, no existing work has explicitly addressed these challenges in RGB-based RA inflammation detection. This paper quantitatively demonstrates the difficulty of visually detecting inflammation by constructing a dedicated dataset, and we propose a inflammation detection framework with global local encoder that combines self-supervised pretraining on large-scale healthy hand images with imbalance-aware training to detect RA-related joint inflammation from RGB hand images.

Traditional image-based methods rely on minimal inter-frame motion to constrain the correspondence search space, which limits their applicability to highly dynamic scenes or necessitates high-speed cameras at the cost of prohibitive storage and computational overhead. We propose an event-frame fusion framework that exploits events for temporally dense motion cues and frames for spatially dense precise estimation. Revisiting the solid elastic modeling prior, we propose an Affine Invariant Simplicial (AIS) framework. It partitions the deformation field into linearized sub-regions with low-parametric representation, effectively mitigating motion ambiguities arising from sparse and noisy events. To speed up parameter searching and reduce error accumulation, a neighborhood-greedy optimization strategy is introduced, enabling well-converged sub-regions to guide their poorly-converged neighbors, effectively suppress local error accumulation in long-term dense tracking.

To address this, we propose MAPA: a multi-turn adaptive prompting attack that 1) at each turn, alternates text-vision attack actions to elicit the most malicious response; and 2) across turns, adjusts the attack trajectory through iterative back-and-forth refinement to gradually amplify response maliciousness.

This paper proposes pFedNavi, a structure-aware and dynamically adaptive personalized federated learning framework tailored for VLN. Our key idea is to personalize where it matters: pFedNavi adaptively identifies client-specific layers via layer-wise mixing coefficients, and performs fine-grained parameter fusion on the selected components (e.g., the encoder-decoder projection and environment-sensitive decoder layers) to balance global knowledge sharing with local specialization. We evaluate pFedNavi on two standard VLN benchmarks, R2R and RxR, using both ResNet and CLIP visual representations.

Recent learning-based methods have demonstrated strong representational capacity for geometric perception and are increasingly used to augment classical geometry-centric systems in practice. However, whether learning components should directly replace geometric estimation or instead serve as intermediate modules within such pipelines remains an open question.\n  In this work, we address this gap and investigate an end-to-end modular framework for effective spatial reasoning, where learning proposes geometric hypotheses, while geometric algorithms dispose estimation decisions. In particular, we study this principle in the context of relative camera pose estimation on RGB-D sequences. Using VGGT as a representative learning model, we evaluate learning-based pose and depth proposals under varying motion magnitudes and scene dynamics, followed by a classical point-to-plane RGB-D ICP as the geometric backend. Our experiments on the TUM RGB-D benchmark reveal three consistent findings: (1) learning-based pose proposals alone are unreliable; (2) learning-proposed geometry, when improperly aligned with camera intrinsics, can degrade performance; and (3) when learning-proposed depth is geometrically aligned and followed by a geometric disposal stage, consistent improvements emerge in moderately challenging rigid settings.\n  These results demonstrate that geometry is not merely a refinement component, but an essential arbiter that validates and absorbs learning-based geometric observations. Our study highlights the importance of modular, geometry-aware system design for robust spatial perception.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5c06\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u51e0\u4f55\u6a21\u5757\u5bf9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u53ef\u6216\u7f3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u51e0\u4f55\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u4e2d\u4f9d\u8d56\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u800c\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u80fd\u589e\u5f3a\u8868\u5f81\u4f46\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u9700\u63a2\u7d22\u4e8c\u8005\u7684\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u5b66\u4e60\u7ec4\u4ef6\u662f\u5426\u5e94\u5b8c\u5168\u66ff\u4ee3\u51e0\u4f55\u4f30\u8ba1\u6216\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f85\u52a9\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528VGGT\u7b49\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u51e0\u4f55\u5047\u8bbe\uff08\u5982\u59ff\u6001\u3001\u6df1\u5ea6\uff09\uff0c\u518d\u901a\u8fc7\u7ecf\u5178\u70b9\u5230\u5e73\u9762RGB-D ICP\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u51e0\u4f55\u4f18\u5316\u3002\u5728TUM RGB-D\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "1\uff09\u4ec5\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u59ff\u6001\u63d0\u6848\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\uff1b2\uff09\u672a\u6b63\u786e\u5bf9\u9f50\u76f8\u673a\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u51e0\u4f55\u964d\u4f4e\u6027\u80fd\uff1b3\uff09\u51e0\u4f55\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e14\u7ed3\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u540e\uff0c\u5728\u4e2d\u5ea6\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u51e0\u4f55\u6a21\u5757\u662f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u5438\u6536\u5b66\u4e60\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\uff0c\u9700\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u3001\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u67b6\u6784\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u7a7a\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u3002"}}

Despite this, most VIO evaluations emphasize nominal sensor behavior, leaving the effects of sustained sensor degradation under operational conditions insufficiently understood. This paper presents a controlled empirical study of VIO behavior under degraded sensing, examining faults affecting visual and inertial modalities across a range of operating regimes. Through systematic fault injection and quantitative evaluation, we observe a pronounced asymmetry in fault impact where degradations affecting visual sensing typically lead to bounded pose errors on the order of centimeters, whereas degradations affecting inertial sensing can induce substantially larger trajectory deviations, in some cases reaching hundreds to thousands of meters. These observations motivate greater emphasis on inertial reliability in the evaluation and design of XR systems for real-life industrial settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "XR\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f9d\u8d56VIO\u8fdb\u884c\u59ff\u6001\u8ddf\u8e2a\uff0c\u4f46\u5de5\u4e1a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u60ef\u6027\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6613\u9000\u5316\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u60ef\u6027\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u9000\u5316\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bef\u5dee\u53ef\u8fbe\u767e\u7c73\u7ea7\uff0c\u8fdc\u8d85\u89c6\u89c9\u9000\u5316\uff08\u5398\u7c73\u7ea7\uff09\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u5f3a\u5316\u60ef\u6027\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709VIO\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u57fa\u4e8e\u7406\u60f3\u4f20\u611f\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u672a\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\u5de5\u4e1a\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u9000\u5316\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u60ef\u6027\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8fdb\u884c\u6545\u969c\u6ce8\u5165\uff0c\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0e\u60ef\u6027\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u9000\u5316\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u7684\u6545\u969c\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u59ff\u6001\u8bef\u5dee\u53ca\u8f68\u8ff9\u504f\u79bb\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u89c6\u89c9\u9000\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\u6709\u9650\uff08\u5398\u7c73\u7ea7\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u60ef\u6027\u9000\u5316\u53ef\u5bfc\u81f4\u7c73\u7ea7\u81f3\u5343\u7c73\u7ea7\u8f68\u8ff9\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5448\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5de5\u4e1aXR\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9700\u66f4\u91cd\u89c6\u60ef\u6027\u4f20\u611f\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u5e94\u7eb3\u5165\u975e\u7406\u60f3\u4f20\u611f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002"}}

A primary challenge w.r.t AU detection is the effective learning of discriminative and generalizable AU representations under conditions of limited annotated data. To address this, we propose a Hierarchical Vision-language Interaction for AU Understanding (HiVA) method, which leverages textual AU descriptions as semantic priors to guide and enhance AU detection. Specifically, HiVA employs a large language model to generate diverse and contextually rich AU descriptions to strengthen language-based representation learning. To capture both fine-grained and holistic vision-language associations, HiVA introduces an AU-aware dynamic graph module that facilitates the learning of AU-specific visual representations. These features are further integrated within a hierarchical cross-modal attention architecture comprising two complementary mechanisms: Disentangled Dual Cross-Attention (DDCA), which establishes fine-grained, AU-specific interactions between visual and textual features, and Contextual Dual Cross-Attention (CDCA), which models global inter-AU dependencies. This collaborative, cross-modal learning paradigm enables HiVA to leverage multi-grained vision-based AU features in conjunction with refined language-based AU details, culminating in robust and semantically enriched AU detection capabilities. Extensive experiments show that HiVA consistently surpasses state-of-the-art approaches. Besides, qualitative analyses reveal that HiVA produces semantically meaningful activation patterns, highlighting its efficacy in learning robust and interpretable cross-modal correspondences for comprehensive facial behavior analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aHiVA\uff08Hierarchical Vision-language Interaction for AU Understanding\uff09\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9762\u90e8\u52a8\u4f5c\u5355\u5143\uff08AU\uff09\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u63d0\u5347AU\u68c0\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u9762\u90e8\u52a8\u4f5c\u5355\u5143\u68c0\u6d4b\u65e8\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u57fa\u4e8eFACS\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u9762\u90e8\u808c\u8089\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u8db3\u65f6\u96be\u4ee5\u5b66\u4e60\u6709\u6548\u8868\u793a\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6709\u9650\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u8bed\u4e49\u5148\u9a8c\u53ca\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5173\u8054\u7684\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u3002\u672c\u6587\u7684\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u63d0\u5347AU\u8868\u793a\u7684\u5224\u522b\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "HiVA\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1\uff09\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684AU\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\uff1b2\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1AU\u611f\u77e5\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u6355\u83b7\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u7684\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u5173\u8054\uff1b3\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u5206\u5c42\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u67b6\u6784\uff08\u542bDDCA\u4e0eCDCA\uff09\uff1aDDCA\u5b9e\u73b0\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0cCDCA\u5efa\u6a21\u5168\u5c40AU\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eHiVA\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6a21\u5f0f\u5177\u6709\u8bed\u4e49\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "HiVA\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u534f\u540c\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86AU\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\uff0c\u5bf9\u5168\u9762\u5206\u6790\u9762\u90e8\u884c\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

In this work, we address this challenge by introducing layer-wise controllable generation through simplified vector graphics (VGs). Our approach first efficiently parses images into hierarchical VG representations that are semantic-aligned and structurally coherent. Building on this representation, we design a novel image synthesis framework guided by VGs, allowing users to freely modify elements and seamlessly translate these edits into photorealistic outputs. By leveraging the structural and semantic features of VGs in conjunction with noise prediction, our method provides precise control over geometry, color, and object semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in diverse applications, including image editing, object-level manipulation, and fine-grained content creation, establishing a new paradigm for controllable image generation.

While existing methods have made great strides, most of them operate at global level but overlook region-wise and even pixel-wise semantic correspondence. To address this, we propose CoCoDiff, a novel training-free and low-cost style transfer framework that leverages pretrained latent diffusion models to achieve fine-grained, semantically consistent stylization. We identify that correspondence cues within generative diffusion models are under-explored and that content consistency across semantically matched regions is often neglected. CoCoDiff introduces a pixel-wise semantic correspondence module that mines intermediate diffusion features to construct a dense alignment map between content and style images. Furthermore, a cycle-consistency module then enforces structural and perceptual alignment across iterations, yielding object and region level stylization that preserves geometry and detail.

We introduce TikArt (Thinking Aperture), an aperture-guided agent that casts multi-step vision-language reasoning as a decision process over regions of interest. TikArt follows a Think-Aperture-Observe loop, alternating between language generation and two aperture actions: Zoom extracts rectangular crops, while Segment invokes SAM2 to obtain mask-based crops for irregular targets. After every action, the model must produce an explicit observation, turning local visual cues into persistent linguistic memory. Built on Qwen3-VL-8B, TikArt optimizes its reasoning policy with AGRPO, a GRPO-style reinforcement learning algorithm with a two-stage curriculum: it warms up segmentation actions and then jointly optimizes visual math, fine-grained VQA, and segmentation, using rewards that couple task success with purposeful aperture use.

To address this, we propose an end-to-end prototype instance semantic disentanglement framework with low-rank regularized subspace clustering, PID-LRSC, in two aspects. First, we use secondary instance subspace learning to construct low-rank regularized subspace clustering (LRSC), addressing instance entanglement caused by an excessive proportion of non tumor instances. Second, we employ enhanced contrastive learning to design prototype instance semantic disentanglement (PID), resolving semantic entanglement caused by the high similarity between tumor and precancerous tissues.

Recently, structure-preserving methods have achieved promising results in conditional image generation by using a base model for prompt conditioning and an adapter for structure input, such as sketches or depth maps. These approaches are highly inefficient and sometimes require equal parameters in the adapter compared to the base architecture. It is not always possible to train the model since the diffusion model is itself costly, and doubling the parameter is highly inefficient. In these approaches, the adapter is not aware of the input prompt; therefore, it is optimal only for the structural input but not for the input prompt. To overcome the above challenges, we proposed two efficient adapters, Nexus Prime and Slim, which are guided by prompts and structural inputs. Each Nexus Block incorporates cross-attention mechanisms to enable rich multimodal conditioning. Therefore, the proposed adapter has a better understanding of the input prompt while preserving the structure. We conducted extensive experiments on the proposed models and demonstrated that the Nexus Prime adapter significantly enhances performance, requiring only 8M additional parameters compared to the baseline, T2I-Adapter. Furthermore, we also introduced a lightweight Nexus Slim adapter with 18M fewer parameters than the T2I-Adapter, which still achieved state-of-the-art results.

We compare a dedicated OCR transformer (TrOCR) and a general-purpose Vision-Language Model (Qwen) on line-level historical English texts using length-weighted accuracy metrics and hypothesis driven error analysis.\n  While Qwen achieves lower CER/WER and greater robustness to degraded input, it exhibits selective linguistic regularization and orthographic normalization that may silently alter historically meaningful forms. TrOCR preserves orthographic fidelity more consistently but is more prone to cascading error propagation.

However, existing approaches assume similar acquisition views (e.g., vehicle-mounted) and struggle in cross-view scenarios, where observations differ substantially due to viewpoint-dependent structural incompleteness and non-uniform point density. Accordingly, we formulate cross-view domain generalization for LiDAR semantic segmentation and propose a novel framework, termed CVGC (Cross-View Geometric Consistency). Specifically, we introduce a cross-view geometric augmentation module that models viewpoint-induced variations in visibility and sampling density, generating multiple cross-view observations of the same scene. Subsequently, a geometric consistency module enforces consistent semantic and occupancy predictions across geometrically augmented point clouds of the same scene. Extensive experiments on six public LiDAR datasets establish the first systematic evaluation of cross-view domain generalization for LiDAR semantic segmentation, demonstrating that CVGC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods when generalizing from a single source domain to multiple target domains with heterogeneous acquisition viewpoints.

In practice, however, existing approaches are typically optimized for specific data conditions, making their deployment reliant on retraining and limiting their generalization as a unified solution. We present OmniVTON++, a training-free VTON framework designed for universal applicability. It addresses the intertwined challenges of garment alignment, human structural coherence, and boundary continuity by coordinating Structured Garment Morphing for correspondence-driven garment adaptation, Principal Pose Guidance for step-wise structural regulation during diffusion sampling, and Continuous Boundary Stitching for boundary-aware refinement, forming a cohesive pipeline without task-specific retraining.

Diffusion-based planners suffer from modality alignment difficulties, low training efficiency, and limited generalization. Token-based planners are plagued by cumulative causal errors and irreversible decoding. In summary, the two dominant paradigms exhibit complementary strengths and weaknesses. In this paper, we propose DriveFine, a masked diffusion VLA model that combines flexible decoding with self-correction capabilities. In particular, we design a novel plug-and-play block-MoE, which seamlessly injects a refinement expert on top of the generation expert. By enabling explicit expert selection during inference and gradient blocking during training, the two experts are fully decoupled, preserving the foundational capabilities and generic patterns of the pretrained weights, which highlights the flexibility and extensibility of the block-MoE design. Furthermore, we design a hybrid reinforcement learning strategy that encourages effective exploration of refinement expert while maintaining training stability.

We aim for this effort to provide more value than just consolidating information already included in the existing technical documentation.

The authentic and detailed operational mechanisms of YOLO26 are inside the source code, which is seldom extracted by others.

ViTs split images into fixed-size patches, constraining them to a predefined size and necessitating pre-processing steps like resizing, padding, or cropping. This poses challenges in medical imaging, particularly with irregularly shaped structures like tumors. A fixed bounding box crop size produces input images with highly variable foreground-to-background ratios. Resizing medical images can degrade information and introduce artefacts, impacting diagnosis. Hence, tailoring variable-sized crops to regions of interest can enhance feature representation capabilities. Moreover, large images are computationally expensive, and smaller sizes risk information loss, presenting a computation-accuracy tradeoff. We propose VariViT, an improved ViT model crafted to handle variable image sizes while maintaining a consistent patch size. VariViT employs a novel positional embedding resizing scheme for a variable number of patches. We also implement a new batching strategy within VariViT to reduce computational complexity, resulting in faster training and inference times. In our evaluations on two 3D brain MRI datasets, VariViT surpasses vanilla ViTs and ResNet in glioma genotype prediction and brain tumor classification. It achieves F1-scores of 75.5% and 76.3%, respectively, learning more discriminative features. Our proposed batching strategy reduces computation time by up to 30% compared to conventional architectures. These findings underscore the efficacy of VariViT in image representation learning.

While existing research often treats hallucinations as a uniform issue, our work addresses a significant gap in multimodal evaluation by decomposing these errors into five categories: pasted object hallucinations, background hallucinations, object omission, positional & logical inconsistencies, and physical law violations. To address these complexities, we propose a multi-stage detection pipeline. Our architecture processes recontextualized images through a series of specialized steps targeting object-level fidelity, background consistency, and omission detection, leveraging a coordinated ensemble of open-source models, whose effectiveness is demonstrated through extensive experimental evaluations.

As underlying models grow more powerful, researchers are exploring increasingly diverse conditioning signals, such as depth maps, edge maps, camera parameters, and reference images, to give users finer control over generation. Among different modalities, sketches are a natural and long-standing form of human communication, enabling rapid expression of visual concepts. Previous literature has largely focused on edge maps, often misnamed 'sketches', yet algorithms that effectively handle true freehand sketches, with their inherent abstraction and distortions, remain underexplored. We pursue the challenging goal of balancing photorealism with sketch adherence when generating images from freehand input. A key obstacle is the absence of ground-truth, pixel-aligned images: by their nature, freehand sketches do not have a single correct alignment. To address this, we propose a modulation-based approach that prioritizes semantic interpretation of the sketch over strict adherence to individual edge positions. We further introduce a novel loss that enables training on freehand sketches without requiring ground-truth pixel-aligned images. We show that our method outperforms existing approaches in both semantic alignment with freehand sketch inputs and in the realism and overall quality of the generated images.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6b64\u8bba\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u7531\u624b\u7ed8\u8349\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8bed\u4e49\u89e3\u91ca\u4e0e\u65b0\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u8fb9\u7f18\u56fe\u7b49\u6761\u4ef6\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u4f46\u81ea\u7531\u624b\u7ed8\u8349\u56fe\u56e0\u62bd\u8c61\u6027\u548c\u5931\u771f\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u50cf\u7d20\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5730\u9762\u5b9e\u51b5\u56fe\u50cf\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u4ee5\u8349\u56fe\u8bed\u4e49\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u7684\u8c03\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u50cf\u7d20\u5bf9\u9f50\u771f\u503c\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8349\u56fe\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u903c\u771f\u3001\u8d28\u91cf\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u81ea\u7531\u624b\u7ed8\u8349\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

However, they introduce significant ethical and legal risks, such as deepfakes and unauthorized use of copyrighted visual content. To address these risks, image immunization has emerged as a promising defense against AI-driven semantic manipulation. Yet, most existing approaches rely on image-specific adversarial perturbations that require individual optimization for each image, thereby limiting scalability and practicality. In this paper, we propose the first universal image immunization framework that generates a single, broadly applicable adversarial perturbation specifically designed for diffusion-based editing pipelines. Inspired by universal adversarial perturbation (UAP) techniques used in targeted attacks, our method generates a UAP that embeds a semantic target into images to be protected. Simultaneously, it suppresses original content to effectively misdirect the model's attention during editing. As a result, our approach effectively blocks malicious editing attempts by overwriting the original semantic content in the image via the UAP. Moreover, our method operates effectively even in data-free settings without requiring access to training data or domain knowledge, further enhancing its practicality and broad applicability in real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments show that our method, as the first universal immunization approach, significantly outperforms several baselines in the UAP setting. In addition, despite the inherent difficulty of universal perturbations, our method also achieves performance on par with image-specific methods under a more restricted perturbation budget, while also exhibiting strong black-box transferability across different diffusion models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u8f91\u7ba1\u9053\u7684\u901a\u7528\u56fe\u50cf\u514d\u75ab\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u5355\u4e00\u666e\u9002\u5bf9\u6297\u6270\u52a8\u6709\u6548\u62b5\u5fa1\u6076\u610f\u7f16\u8f91\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u5177\u5f3a\u5927\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5f15\u53d1\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2a\u9020\u548c\u7248\u6743\u6ee5\u7528\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u50cf\u514d\u75ab\u65b9\u6848\u4f9d\u8d56\u9010\u4f8b\u4f18\u5316\u7279\u5b9a\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u901a\u7528\u5bf9\u6297\u6270\u52a8(UAP)\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5d4c\u5165\u8bed\u4e49\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u666e\u9002\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8986\u76d6\u539f\u56fe\u5185\u5bb9\u8bef\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u3002\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6216\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u5373\u53ef\u8fd0\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "\u5728UAP\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u53d7\u9650\u6270\u52a8\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u4e0e\u56fe\u50cf\u4e13\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u5907\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u9ed1\u76d2\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9996\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u56fe\u50cf\u514d\u75ab\u65b9\u6848\u517c\u5177\u7406\u8bba\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u73b0\u5b9e\u666e\u9002\u6027\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u8986\u76d6\u9632\u5fa1\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002"}}

While there is extensive research on the role of image information for perceptual tasks, the role of the temporal dimension remains less well understood: What can we learn about the world from long-term motion information? What properties does long-term motion information have for visual learning? We leverage recent success in point-track estimation, which offers an excellent opportunity to learn temporal representations and experiment on a variety of perceptual tasks. We draw 3 clear lessons: 1) Long-term motion representations contain information to understand actions, but also objects, materials, and spatial information, often even better than images. 2) Long-term motion representations generalize far better than image representations in low-data settings and in zero-shot tasks. 3) The very low dimensionality of motion information makes motion representations a better trade-off between GFLOPs and accuracy than standard video representations, and used together they achieve higher performance than video representations alone. We hope these insights will pave the way for the design of future models that leverage the power of long-term motion information for perception.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u957f\u671f\u8fd0\u52a8\u4fe1\u606f\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5176\u4f4e\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7279\u6027\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u56fe\u50cf\u4fe1\u606f\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u4f46\u65f6\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6(\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u957f\u671f\u8fd0\u52a8\u4fe1\u606f)\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u4ecd\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5176\u5bf9\u52a8\u4f5c/\u7269\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u65f6\u7a7a\u4fe1\u606f\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u53ca\u4e0e\u56fe\u50cf\u7279\u6027\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u70b9\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f30\u8ba1\u6280\u672f\u6784\u5efa\u957f\u671f\u8fd0\u52a8\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u611f\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5c5e\u6027\u4e0e\u89c6\u9891\u8868\u793a\u7684\u534f\u540c\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "result": "1) \u8fd0\u52a8\u8868\u793a\u53ef\u7f16\u7801\u52a8\u4f5c\u3001\u7269\u4f53\u6750\u8d28\u53ca\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\uff1b2) \u5728\u5c0f\u6837\u672c/\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u66f4\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff1b3) \u5176\u4f4e\u7ef4\u7279\u6027\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4e0e\u89c6\u9891\u8868\u793a\u878d\u5408\u53ef\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u957f\u671f\u8fd0\u52a8\u4fe1\u606f\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u672a\u6765\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e94\u4f18\u5148\u6574\u5408\u8fd0\u52a8\u7279\u6027\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

These factors significantly limit the applicability of continuous learning in real-world settings, as iterative model updates require significant computational resources and inherently exacerbate forgetting. We present SAILS -- Segment Anything with Incrementally Learned Semantics, a training-free framework for Class-Incremental Semantic Segmentation (CISS) that sidesteps these challenges entirely. SAILS leverages foundational models to decouple CISS into two stages: Zero-shot region extraction using Segment Anything Model (SAM), followed by semantic association through prototypes in a fixed feature space. SAILS incorporates selective intra-class clustering, resulting in multiple prototypes per class to better model intra-class variability. Our results demonstrate that, despite requiring no incremental training, SAILS typically surpasses the performance of existing training-based approaches on standard CISS datasets, particularly in long and challenging task sequences where forgetting tends to be most severe. By avoiding parameter updates, SAILS completely eliminates forgetting and maintains consistent, task-invariant performance.

In contrast, recent generic object trackers are often optimized for training targets, which limits robustness and generalization in unseen scenarios, and their occlusion reasoning remains coarse, lacking detailed modeling of occlusion patterns. To address these limitations in generalization and occlusion perception, we propose GOT-JEPA, a model-predictive pretraining framework that extends JEPA from predicting image features to predicting tracking models. Given identical historical information, a teacher predictor generates pseudo-tracking models from a clean current frame, and a student predictor learns to predict the same pseudo-tracking models from a corrupted version of the current frame. This design provides stable pseudo supervision and explicitly trains the predictor to produce reliable tracking models under occlusions, distractors, and other adverse observations, improving generalization to dynamic environments. Building on GOT-JEPA, we further propose OccuSolver to enhance occlusion perception for object tracking. OccuSolver adapts a point-centric point tracker for object-aware visibility estimation and detailed occlusion-pattern capture. Conditioned on object priors iteratively generated by the tracker, OccuSolver incrementally refines visibility states, strengthens occlusion handling, and produces higher-quality reference labels that progressively improve subsequent model predictions.

Existing methods have evolved by leveraging the vision information into the language tokens. To more effectively exploit visual contexts for fine-grained segmentation, we propose a novel Visual Informative Part Attention (VIPA) framework for referring image segmentation. VIPA leverages the informative parts of visual contexts, called a visual expression, which can effectively provide the structural and semantic visual target information to the network. This design reduces high-variance cross-modal projection and enhances semantic consistency in an attention mechanism of the referring image segmentation. We also design a visual expression generator (VEG) module, which retrieves informative visual tokens via local-global linguistic context cues and refines the retrieved tokens for reducing noise information and sharing informative visual attributes. This module allows the visual expression to consider comprehensive contexts and capture semantic visual contexts of informative regions.

Task-driven hard-attention models for vision are often evaluated by how well their scanpaths match human gaze. However, common scanpath metrics can be strongly confounded by dataset-specific center bias, especially on object-centric datasets. Using Gaze-CIFAR-10, we show that a trivial center-fixation baseline achieves surprisingly strong scanpath scores, approaching many learned policies. This makes standard metrics optimistic and blurs the distinction between genuine behavioral alignment and mere central tendency. We then analyze a hard-attention classifier under constrained vision by sweeping foveal patch size and peripheral context, revealing a peripheral sweet spot: only a narrow range of sensory constraints yields scanpaths that are simultaneously (i) above the center baseline after debiasing and (ii) temporally human-like in movement statistics. To address center bias, we propose GCS (Gaze Consistency Score), a center-debiased composite metric augmented with movement similarity. GCS uncovers a robust sweet spot at medium patch size with both foveal and peripheral vision, that is not obvious from raw scanpath metrics or accuracy alone, and also highlights a \"shortcut regime\" when the field-of-view becomes too large.

In this work, we present a method to improve the performance of STA predictions. Our contributions are two-fold: 1 We propose STAformer and STAformer plus plus, two novel attention-based architectures integrating frame-guided temporal pooling, dual image-video attention, and multiscale feature fusion to support STA predictions from an image-input video pair; 2 We introduce two novel modules to ground STA predictions on human behavior by modeling affordances. First, we integrate an environment affordance model which acts as a persistent memory of interactions that can take place in a given physical scene. We explore how to integrate environment affordances via simple late fusion and with an approach which adaptively learns how to best fuse affordances with end-to-end predictions. Second, we predict interaction hotspots from the observation of hands and object trajectories, increasing confidence in STA predictions localized around the hotspot. Our results show significant improvements on Overall Top-5 mAP, with gain up to +23p.p on Ego4D and +31p.p on a novel set of curated EPIC-Kitchens STA labels.

At a given dimension, image samples are regarded as simplicial complexes, and persistent sheaf Laplacians are utilized to extract a multiscale localized topological spectral representation for individual image samples. Statistical summaries of the resulting spectra are then aggregated across scales and dimensions to form multiscale multi-dimensional image representations.

Existing memory-based approaches often condition generation on globally reconstructed 3D scenes by rendering anchor videos from the reconstructed geometry in the history.

When fused, these inconsistencies accumulate into noisy geometry that contaminates the conditioning signals and degrades generation quality. We introduce AnchorWeave, a memory-augmented video generation framework that replaces a single misaligned global memory with multiple clean local geometric memories and learns to reconcile their cross-view inconsistencies. To this end, AnchorWeave performs coverage-driven local memory retrieval aligned with the target trajectory and integrates the selected local memories through a multi-anchor weaving controller during generation.

Yet producing high-fidelity articulated assets remains difficult to scale because it requires reliable part decomposition and kinematic rigging. Existing approaches largely fall into two paradigms: optimization-based reconstruction or distillation, which can be accurate but often takes tens of minutes to hours per instance, and inference-time methods that rely on template or part retrieval, producing plausible results that may not match the specific structure and appearance in the input observation. We introduce a part-centric generative framework for articulated object creation that synthesizes part geometry, composition, and articulation under explicit part-aware conditioning. Our representation models an object as a set of movable parts, each encoded by latent tokens augmented with part identity and articulation cues. Conditioned on a single image, the model generates articulated 3D assets that preserve instance-level correspondence while maintaining valid part structure and motion. The resulting approach avoids per-instance optimization, enables fast feed-forward inference, and supports controllable assembly and articulation, which are important for embodied interaction.

Our approach works by learning an encoder that maps natural images uniformly onto a spherical latent space, and a decoder that maps random latent vectors back to the image space. Trained solely through image reconstruction losses, the model generates an image by simply decoding a random point on the sphere. Our architecture naturally supports conditional generation, and looping the encoder/decoder a few times can further enhance image quality. Across several datasets, the sphere encoder approach yields performance competitive with state of the art diffusions, but with a small fraction of the inference cost.

However, their computational cost is a major bottleneck, as they are often designed to inefficiently process the full video context regardless of the inpainting mask's size, even for sparse, localized edits. In this paper, we introduce EditCtrl, an efficient video inpainting control framework that focuses computation only where it is needed. Our approach features a novel local video context module that operates solely on masked tokens, yielding a computational cost proportional to the edit size. This local-first generation is then guided by a lightweight temporal global context embedder that ensures video-wide context consistency with minimal overhead. Not only is EditCtrl 10 times more compute efficient than state-of-the-art generative editing methods, it even improves editing quality compared to methods designed with full-attention. Finally, we showcase how EditCtrl unlocks new capabilities, including multi-region editing with text prompts and autoregressive content propagation.", "AI": {"tldr": "EditCtrl\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u4fee\u590d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0e\u8f7b\u91cf\u5168\u5c40\u5f15\u5bfc\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u7f16\u8f91\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5feb10\u500d\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u591a\u533a\u57df\u7f16\u8f91\u548c\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u5185\u5bb9\u4f20\u64ad\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u5168\u89c6\u9891\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8fdb\u884c\u5197\u4f59\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6548\u652f\u6301\u5c40\u90e8\u7a00\u758f\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5c40\u90e8\u89c6\u9891\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u4ec5\u5904\u7406\u906e\u7f69\u533a\u57df\u5185\u7684token\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u65f6\u5e8f\u5168\u5c40\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5d4c\u5165\u5668\u4fdd\u6301\u89c6\u9891\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u5c40\u90e8\u4f18\u5148\u7684\u751f\u6210\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u8fbeSOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\u768410\u500d\uff0c\u7f16\u8f91\u8d28\u91cf\u8d85\u8d8a\u5168\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u3002", "conclusion": "EditCtrl\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8-\u5168\u5c40\u534f\u540c\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u8f91\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u62d3\u5c55\u51fa\u591a\u533a\u57df\u6587\u672c\u9a71\u52a8\u7f16\u8f91\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u4f20\u64ad\u7b49\u65b0\u529f\u80fd\u3002"}}
